I always thought love would be happy and lots of smiles but I realize this isn't the case. I realize this as I'm sitting here typing this with tears in my eyes because I miss my boyfriend so friggin much. I just want to see him smile again and have him hold me in his arms and not let me go. I won't be able to see him for about another month approximately. Damn it I miss him.

About what I dont know so I'm just going to saying whatever pops into my head. I really don't like staying at dads house it brings back way too many memories. Memories of pain and fear and I hate them. I guess you could say it also brings back memories of anger as well but not many of those memories are of love. The bad thing about my mind is I can see a day happen all over again. I can see the last day I actually lived here and the day I told my brother what happened with me and my ex. Those are the ones that stand out clearly. I don't really remember any time that my father looked at me with love. Yeah I know he loves me but what can I say? He never really shows it. Yeah he always stays with me when I'm in the hospital but he never really shows it any way else. When I lived here he was always yelling at me cause I did something wrong in his eyes. More times than not I hadn't or it was something very minor. Is it any wonder I learned to fear that man? I'm not sure I will ever trust him again like I did when I was a kid but I think I start to trust him some. Of course that would mean that he would have to change some things but I doubt he ever will. I don't think he will ever admit that he has issues with his anger or issues with his drinking. I could try and get him to get help but he doesn't see that he is the one at fault most times. I know that this may confuse some of you but I don't wanna display everything that happened to the workd. These are just some thoughts that I've been thinking about lately.

I've gotten a boyfriend, found that one of my friends has probably been playing with my emotions for the past few months now, among other things. Oh and I can't forget that my dad is being a dickhead again. Huge shock I know. Well he recently decided that he was going to move my savings account to another with higher interest thats fine with me. What isn't fine is the fact that he put his name on the account instead of mine. So right now I don't have access to my money. They money that I earned. Yeah he had his name on the account before but that was because I wasn't 18 yet. I am now and he doesn't need to be on it. So when I needed money like I did yesterday I had to call my dad up and have him bring some. What I don't get is why he couldn't just pick me up and take me to the bank to get it straightened out. It's not like it would take a long time to accomplish. It would take maybe 10 minutes and he didn't even need the account information they could look it up. They found the account for me when I went there. So I now have to wait until the weekend to get this taken care of and when I do I'm going to find a way to either a) kick him off or <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> transfer the funds to another account that I set up. As far as I know he doesn't even put money in the account. Oh something else that pisses me off is he still gets the bank statements but he doesn't show me. I haven't seen a bank statement for that account in like 3 or 4 months at least. When I asked him about this he just said that yeah he's gotten a statement but yet he doesn't show me. I don't like that. Knowing him he's taking money out to go drinking. It's not even addressed to him!

<br /><br />Who is this man?
<br /><br />He's not the one that I once knew
<br /><br />He's a stranger that doesn't see the pain he causes
<br /><br />I want to run but I can't move
<br /><br />I want to push him away but arms feel like lead
<br /><br />I want to scream but nothing will come out
<br /><br />What is happening to me?
<br /><br />The skies are getting darker
<br /><br />All I see is this face that's void of emotion
<br /><br />All I feel is my innocense slowly fading
<br /><br />With every stroke
<br /><br />He changed my life forever just with that one act
<br /><br />For those that are curious this is about what Devin did to me. It's taken me this long to finally to get it out hopefully now I can start moving forward again as soon as I cut Devin out of my life again.

After meeting this awesome guy I’m wondering if I actually deserve him. I mean seriously look at my life so far. I grew up listening to my parents fight with each other and with my brother. It always scared me too. Maybe somehow deep down I knew what was really happening. Maybe I realized that someday we would be where we are now. We aren’t really a family anymore. I very rarely talk to my brother who I used to be so close to. I barely talk to my father and he never calls me except when he wants me to fix the computer. Hell we’re even fighting against each other in this divorce. It’s guys against girls. What kind of family is that? People always say I’m sorry you’re going through that and frankly I’m tired of hearing it. It’s not sympathy that I want. All I want is someone that I can go to when things go crazy. There are just sometimes that I feel like no one gives a shit about me and they wouldn’t care if I died or not. Now for the record I’m not suicidal. Those days are over. I just keep wondering what is going to happen. If this is actually going to last or is my past going to come back and haunt me again. The last thing I want is to get hurt again and part of me is scared I will. I don’t want to end up the way that I did with Kevin. I can’t go through that kind of betrayal and heartbreak again. That’s just not something I could handle. One of the more common things people say about me is that I’m strong. If that’s the case then why don’t I feel like it? There are some days that I just want to turn around and run far, far away. How strong does that make me if I just want to run away?  People look at me but they don’t take the time to look past the mask I wear. Only a few people have seen past it. Sorry I know this jumps around a little bit I just needed to do a mental mind dumping.

I am offically not single anymore as of February 14th and I am dating the awesomest guy ever. Cody is smart, funny and just plain adorable. Anyway,  moving on to what's been happening. I still don't have a job but I am going to start looking again after Spring Break which is starting tomorrow. WOOOOO HOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! I may get to go down to see Cody too. I got my fingers crossed. Other than that my parents getting along better but they still haven't finalized the divorce yet. My brother has quit smoking and for that I am very proud of him. That's the good stuff that's been happening. The bad stuff is I found out yesterday that a very close friend of mine was beat to death a week ago. So right now I have so many questions and very few answers. I just feel so guilty that I wasn't there to help him. I just wish I could turn back the hands of time but I can't. I just don't know how to go forward at this point. He meant a lot to me and I never really got to tell him how much he meant to me. Now his kids have lost a father and his wife lost the love of her life. So all I ask is that you pray for his family as they are going through a really tough time right now.

For those that don't know I went down to see my boyfriend on the weekend and it was probably the most fun that I've had in a long time. I got to meet at least part of his family and get my butt kicked in pool which means I lost the bet. Oh well. One of the kinda funny things that happened was when we were warming up it was my turn to shoot and I hit the cue ball a little too low and a little too hard with the stick and it almost hit him in the face. I felt so bad but I found out that he had good reflexes cause he jerked back before it hit him. I still lost the game though. I think I won one game but that's only because he hit the 8 ball in the wrong pocket. Oh well I'm going to have to get some friends together and go shoot some pool so I can beat him next time. When we were walking afterwards a lady that was sitting in a car at the stoplight rolled her window down and told us that we were a cute couple. Plus people kept honking at us it was kinda cool and strange at the same time. This was on Friday night. On Saturday we didn't really go out much but his sister made some spaghetti and told us that if we wanted to we could eat in our room. She put the bar thingy in there and I turned on some music. Next thing I know she's bringing us wine glasses and lighting a candle like in Lady and the Tramp. It was awesome. When we were walking to his parents house this guy was driving by and he honked at us which scared the crap out of me. He had the weirdest horn that I've heard. We went to Jack In The Box<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> afterwards and I got an awesome shake that I never did for a few reasons one of which was I forgot about it. Anyway once we started walking back to his sisters house the sky just opened up and started pouring. We both got soaked but I'll be damned if it wasn't fun as hell. That's the bulk of what happened. There's a hell of a lot more but yeah I don't have time to type all that. As for the rest of the week I didn't really do much. It was mostly spent sucking up to my parents so they would let me go down there.

<br />I see you standing there
<br />It is then that I get this urge
<br />An urge to run out and hold you one more time
<br />As I get this urge my eyes fill with tears
<br />I look down at my watch and see that I have 5 minutes left
<br />5 minutes until this train takes farther and farther away from you
<br />Away from the one that I love with all my heart
<br />The train starts to move and turn around to keep you in my sight as long as I possibly can
<br />Once I've lost sight of you I turn around and cry
<br />Why must I have to leave?
<br />Why can't you come with me?
<br />I know the answer to these questions but that doesn't help the emptiness that I feel
<br />As I run out of tears I close my eyes and fall asleep
<br />It is there that I dream of you
<br />Where I dream of the fun times we had and
<br />The fun times that are yet to come
<br />In this dream I see you smile and it's like you are here with me now
<br />But when I open my eyes I know that it is just a dream
<br />A dream that one day will come true

<br />The bullets kept flying
<br />I suddenly became numb with fear
<br />I tried to run but my legs wouldn't move
<br />The moment he turned around I knew that this was going to be my last moments alive
<br />I asked God to forgive me for all the things I've done and to watch over my family for me
<br />It was then that I heard the shot and felt the bullet hit me and I felt my breaths become shorter
<br />I knew that it was my time but I wasn't ready
<br />But I had no choice as my last breath shuddered out of me

Must we have to keep wondering when the next shooting will be or what the next war will be? The shooting at Virginia Tech could have happened anywhere. It could have happened at CLC or any other college. How long are we are going to have to wait before we wake up and realize that some things need to change. If that change means that I have to give up some of my Constitutional rights then so be it. I don't want to have to wait until it happens here or any of the other schools that my friends are at. When are we going to learn? When are we going to learn that stuff like this can be prevented? I don't want to have to keep wondering if this is going to ever to happen here. Yeah I'm thinking of the worst case scenario but maybe it's time I did. I needed the wake up call. Ever since I been going to school here I have never thought that something like this could happen. Now I keep hearing about this and I realize that it can. So my question is when are we going to make it harder for stuff like this to happen? Stuff like this shouldn't be happening but we can't change that. We can only do what we can to prevent it. So maybe we need to have metal detectors here or have to be searched when we get here. It's a thought. Maybe one day there will be world peace who knows?
