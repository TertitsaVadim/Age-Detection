Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or 20-pack. The boy insists on the 20-pack because he 'thinks he will be rather busy', it being his first time and all. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot; 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot; 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.&quot; 
<br />**************************************************- **************************************************- ****************** 
<br />Because u read this, u will get kissed on friday by the person u luv!! &amp; 2maro will be da best day of ur life, so DO NOT BREAK THIS CHAIN!!!!!! IF U BREAK IT, U WILL HAVE RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS!!!!!!!!

<br /><br />Guy: No, this is fun. 
<br /><br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary! 
<br /><br />Guy: Then tell me you love me. 
<br /><br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down! 
<br /><br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug. 
<br /><br />Girl : *hugs him* 
<br /><br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me. 
<br /><br />Girl: Alright, now slow down 
<br /><br />Guy: I love you babe 
<br /><br />(in the paper the next day): 
<br />A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived. 
<br /><br />The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die. 
<br /><br />If u love any one this much re-post this ....and....the love of your life will relize they feel the same .... DONT BREAK THIS . 2morow will be the best day of your life. 
<br />However, if u don t post this by at least 1:00 tonight, you will have bad luck in your love life 4 the rest of your life.
