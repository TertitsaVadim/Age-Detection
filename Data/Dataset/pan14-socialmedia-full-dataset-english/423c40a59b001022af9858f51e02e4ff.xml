<br />Hope u all enjoy reading it and understand what this story wanna teach us...
<br />Ok, the story begin now... 
<br /><br />At long long time ago, got one man call &quot;WindWalker&quot;. WindWalker is married and got a beautiful wife call &quot;Angel&quot;.
<br />After married then WindWalker wish go to one city working for many years to earn money but the problem is the city is very far from his hometown.
<br />Then WindWalker promised with his wife, he told her:&quot;Angel, no matter what, please wait for my return and love me forever, don't fall in love with another guys, ok? I will love u forever too, this is our promise, please keep this promise until i come back many years later.&quot;
<br />Angel promised with WindWalker and then WindWalker go to working after he know his wife will keep their promise.
<br /><br />Work, work, work, WindWalker working everydays and never go back hometown. After working for 21years later, WindWalker wish to go back hometown so he ask his boss to let him go back hometown.
<br />Before the last day, WindWalker boss told him:&quot;Now i give u two choice, first choice is i give u all the money for ur working at here so many years, and the money totally is $1,000,000. Second choice is, i give u three advice but u cannot get any money from ur salary.&quot;
<br /><br />After thinking for whole night, WindWalker know his boss is one old man who is full of intelligence and is one intelligent man then WindWalker got the answer.
<br />At the last day, WindWalker told his boss that he want his three advice and don't want his money. 
<br /><br />So, the boss say:&quot;Ok, since this is ur decision, now i give u three advice, listen carefully... 
<br />1. Never walk shortcut. 
<br />2. For anythings happen and if u don't know what is it then u cannot do it.
<br />3. Never make any decision when u feel madness and despair.
<br />Hope this three advice can help u at ur future life, good luck my friend...&quot;
<br /><br />After give WindWalker this three advice and then The boss give WindWalker three bread and told him only can eat the first two bread on the way go back hometown but for the last bread must save it until WindWalker arrived at hometown and share it together with his lovely wife, Angel.
<br /><br />And then WindWalker say goodbye with his boss and on begin his way to go back hometown... On the halfway, WindWalker meet one guy who he only see once time at his hometown and that guy told him:&quot;Hey, WindWalker, long times no see, u wanna go back hometown? I know one shortcut, u can save many times if u walk this shortcut to go back hometown then u can meet ur wife more quickly and soon...&quot;
<br /><br />At first, WindWalker really wanna follow that guy saying and walk the shortcut, but WindWalker remember back his boss teach him first advice:&quot;1.Never walk shortcut.&quot; 
<br /><br />Then WindWalker don't follow that guy to walk shortcut and choose to walk the normal long way to go bak hometown.
<br /><br />At the next day, WindWalker hear one news saying last night got few peoples robbed and killed by thieves because walking the shortcut.
<br /><br />WindWalker stay at one hotel and on that midnight, WindWalker hear outside of his room got some weird voice and weird sound. 
<br /><br />At first, WindWalker wish to go outside for checking what happen, and then WindWalker remember back his boss second advice:&quot;2. For anythings happen and if u don't know what is it then u cannot do it.&quot; So WindWalker just stay inside his room and never go outside on that midnight.
<br /><br />At the next day, WindWalker hear one news saying that luckily WindWalker never go outside of his room last night because got one crazy man kill so many peoples just because the peoples are go outside to see what happen.
<br /><br />Finally WindWalker arrived at his hometown and when he arrived at his house outside then he saw one guy living inside his house and the guy relationship with his wife is very close...
<br /><br />WindWalker feel very angry and despair...He feel:&quot;Why i can love my wife so much and so many years i never love another woman until now then why my wife she can betray me and love another guy. Why???&quot;
<br /><br />WindWalker feel very angry and wanna kill the guy that living at his house, but before he take any action, he remember back his boss third advice:&quot;3. Never make any decision when u feel madness and despair.&quot; 
<br /><br />Then WindWalker cool down and sleep outside of his house on that night.
<br /><br />At the next day, WindWalker decided to go back his boss place for working and never come back anymore. Before he gone, he knock his house door and wanna say goodbye with his lovely wife, Angel.
<br /><br />WindWalker wife, Angel open the door and see her husband come back feel very happy and touching then hug WindWalker directly...

<br /><br />WindWalker:&quot;Then how about the guy sleep inside our house and relationship with u so close one?&quot;
<br /><br />Angel:&quot;Wind, u are wrong, u are mistake, that guy is not another guy i love, he is our son, after u go working then i realize that i got ur baby then i born him and now he is become a adult so u don't know that guy is our son!&quot;
<br /><br />WindWalker feel so touch and hug Angel so deeply and say:&quot;Thanks for loving me so much and wait for my return, thanks for keeping our promise until now and i will love u forever...&quot;

<br />Foong is one stupid guy when Foong fall in love...
<br />Why Foong saying like that?
<br />All because Foong really is one stupid guy...
<br />Stupid until Foong believe if Foong use all the heart to love the girl Foong love then Foong will get the girl love at the end...
<br />Stupid until Foong believe if Foong love the girl forever then the girl will love Foong forever too...
<br />Stupid until Foong always miss the girl Foong love everydays and after miss her still is miss her...

<br />Still got so many stupid things Foong got did when Foong fall in love...
<br />But, is that mean Foong really is one stupid guy?
<br />Sometimes, in love, this is not call 'stupid', this is Foong believe what is call 'true love'...
<br />But the problem is...
<br />At this world, why no girl wish to believe Foong is true and pure on love??? Why no girl wish to accept Foong love???
<br />Foong never did anythings wrong but why the god never give any chance for Foong to fall in love even for once time???
<br />May be Foong cannot blame god, Foong only can blame Foong ownself...
<br />As long as Foong is Foong, then Foong will still be the stupid guy when Foong fall in love...
