<br />Democracy is a typical ruling authority chosen and empowered to bring about and maintain society  in an orderly organised form for its own wellbeing. Human beings – the only speices which has well developed brain-- can analyse and choose making use of many parameters including its own memory that stores quite a few things as perceptions, experiences etc. Well being of humans have a relationship with physical body, mind and soul of the persons connected.
<br />From times immemorial human beings lived in groups and such groups developed their own methods of living which are unique and in variation with many groups including those which may be very near and in constant contact with them. These groups had their own leader/s who used to control the deviations of behaviour in the group in their own way. Slowly when the groups had expansion kings emerged and kingdoms were organised in a better manner. However human greed and intolerance of others etc. generated emperors and many groups came under their rule. However many weak groups maitained their identity by paying consideration and showing loyalty, regard etc. towards the powerful kings / emperors. Thus over a time period methods of common acceptance for human living among groups by a large percentage intellectuals of the particular group came into existence and they had been treated as “Dharma”. To religiouly observe “Dharma” had become the fundamental duty of every one in human groups. Dharma is variable from group to group and hence from place to place too. Kings / emperors assisted by a group of intellectuals brought about principles, laws rules etc.in their own jurisdiction to provide ruling over the people living within their boundaries. So a common person had to folllow “Dharma” prescribed by the ruler. This was called racial law (Jaati Dharma). 
<br />In our federal democracy in India Parliament and state Assemblies enact laws for us all. We have “Indian Constitution” which either we  blindly adore or some interested elected representatives bring amendments to the constitution to meet specific interests. In fact our Constitution makers in the preamble made it clear that Indian Constitution was made by people of India and delivered to themselves. Perhaps it is impliedly meant that Indian populace only should reject it or amend it because Indian Constitution is the property of Indians. To day none else other than the Supreme authorities like the Parliament or the High Courts  / Supreme court of India may have a say / suggestion in respect of any Article of the voluminous constitution. 
<br />In reality India is a multilinguisitic nation with its many groups of citizens who have their own leaders and discipline. To promote integration among all citizens of various parts of the country is a stupendous task that needs common acceptability at least among leaders of these groups with a written document that is not only well prepared but also well scrutinised and approved  by a considerable majority after a through debate by a different group of intellectuals, leaders etc. and incorporating due consideration/s of each of these groups. 
<br />Indian constitution is a well writtten document by scholars (hats off to their scholarship, patriotism, concerns and hard work) but sufffered want of scrutiny by another group/s as above and the nation is facing war like terrorism in some parts of the nation impeding progress and adding miseries to the life of commoners. This lacuna needs to be corrected and based on the corrections national laws(Jaati Dharma) should be evolved and laws should be enacted. This is an urgent need for the country lest thousands of crores of taxpayers’ money is spent to the detriment of peace and progress of the country. Our well documented scholarly document i.e. “Indian Constitution”fell short of needs of the country and failed partly our democracy. 
<br />All the educated should stop one sided thinking but encourage a practical view which supports freedom of everyone and in that direction elect representatives to lead them for betterment. 
<br />I will continue in my net blog. Meanwhile kindly let me have your enlightened thoughts on the above. Thanking you all

(Part<br/><br/>In ancient India to facilitate better living for a person in a group professions and the required qualities and habits of living therefor were in general prepared under four categories. Any one who possessed the qualities and willing to adopt the prescribed habits of living could join the group of the professionals. However naturally in a family system the habits and professional learning under the guidance of the senior family members were easily acquired by the youngsters and the family became a professional one generation after generation in the group for the professional job the society / group needed. So the members of the family engaged in a particular profession for the society were having the same set of prescriptions written and  unwritten and every one in the family/ families was obliged to observe them as “Dharma” for giving the service to the society as a professional. This code of conduct is called “Professional Laws (Kula Dharma)”. 
<br />Increase in population, want of proper dissemination of information at various levels technology revolution in almost all professions and foreign as also colonial rule  apparently promoted many deviations and time brought  strain and disrepute to these age old professional conduct and these professional practitioners. Some took the opportunity to make some gains out of the changing situation instead of correcting the deviations  or improving the persons concerned apparently partly due to ignorance, personal reasons etc. Now some codes of conduct for doctors, engineers, officers, teachers, employees etc. are finding place amongst us but none of them is hardly cognised by many of the concerned. Indian society in democracy is a hetrogenous mixture of many professionals living in a wide area and many are at loss to know / assess the capability of any one to do his / her job with the required perfection / quality. A common person can not but suffer miseries to get any needed service or work with appreciable quality from the so called society in general. To improve the situation there is a need to usher reforms in the society which would put the desire for personal aggrandisement on the back burner and promote the interests of the society for equity, justice and peace for all the citizens who should be treated as human beings without any adjectives what soever in respect of their family traditional professional practices which should be either outdated or have become irrelevant to living in the current society of independent India. Age, education (information and practice), mind set, and physical and mental qualities of  persons should only be considered while making policies, acts etc to train, employ and extend facilities and the policies should be initiated and finally scrutinised from bottom up for inculcating harmony and smooth integration of nation.
<br />To day there is a huge divide between  the urban population and the rural folks in respect of mind sets, living habits, aspirations, expectations etc. This divide is not congenial to promote harmony and integration among the various groups. Without harmony and integration of minds development of the nation is always at stake and becomes a chance in the process of policy formulations and pursuing efforts to the advantage of narrow gain seekers for isolated self or their family status. Resources of the country are either misdirected or misapplied wittingly or unwittingly.
<br />Our media have become almost commercial and none can hardly expect any value based education to the viewers or readers for developing restraint, patience, good service etc. which are essential for rational integration and progress in the desirable manner.  
<br />In other words there is an urgent need to usher reforms in many areas of our current living to promote social harmony and integration through education with vision, true commitment, honesty, patriotism and balance between material and spiritual aspects of human living. Our elected representatives should have track record of great background and high achievements in this respect.The exercise shall start from home of every educated adult and my friends I, trust , you would concur with me. Let us all please strive and endeavour to equip our juniors and friends with all the relevant inputs as above to make our progress fast towards a great harmonious and prospered nation soon. 
<br />I will further share my mind soon. Meantime I seek your thoughts for better enlightment.

(Part<br/><br/>For any one to live on this earth some basic needs should be made available and in the olden days good kings keeping this aspect in view ruled their kingdoms. In democracy we replace kings by our leaders elected and the elected leaders in India take oath to serve the people by a precribed format and later work according to their convenience and desires. Indeed in a republic the public should elect those who replace good kings of olden days.   
<br />Basic  human needs are a) Food <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Cloths c) House with good amenities for hygenic and peaceful living d) Safety and Security e) Clean and good environment  and f) Education and Literacy g) Work / Employment to earn the needs. In democracy the governments should on the first priority allocate funds and organise that the people earn the above needs securedly and develop for the subjects facilities that the people need not put up with excessive physical strain or mental stress. The facilities should be organised such that the employees and the users save energies and time for doing good work, living and learning with peace.The elected people in office should cognise the above needs and take steps to honestly implement them. 
<br />Today rural population and many urban citizens do migrate/ travel compulsorily from place to place or spend lot of time and energy in travel for the above needs. Transport has been made a big business (instead of reducing its need for the common citizen’s needs)  and fuel costs are ruining the economy. It should be borne in mind that planning should be to add to conservation of the natural resources, reduction in pollution levels, improved standard of living and better working / learning with greater comfort and safety for the common citizen lest the natural wealth is misapplied. The facilities should be available in about a kilometer or so but not exceeding five kilometers. 
<br />a)Food: - 
<br />By and large the food in raw form would be over a period sufficiently and naturally available for all those born and living on this globe. It depends on rain and water supply presuming that the human beings work to harness the nature properly with awareness and knowledge.
<br />The governments on the earth should have global bilateral agreements to share knowledge and timely information to i) timely harness the natural products, ii) share at reasonable costs and iii) plan to store only adequate food grains from the excess for about either a couple of years or a period to be determined from the studies of  relevant past stastistics. The storage should be planned only for adequate protection against the likely short fall plus a small percentage but not under any pressure or greed or irrelevant considerations like profit / loss. Thus food items should not be made / produced / stored very much in excess with speculations  of profit. 
<br />If needed, exchanges which work on forecasts and speculations  of food grains should be closed and the producers and manufacturers shall be encouraged to borrow without fear the interest free money required for labour from banks on very liberal terms for repayment to balance demand and supply of food to all the living. The quality seeds and other materials for production shall be made available free to the producer at the right time in a year. 
<br />The democratically elected governments should keep the welfare and paying capacity of the least earning common person and release immediately food grains as required by the markets to prevent  not only escalation of price to the discomfort of common man but also to make the food availabe to every citizen. They should watch and effect “Quantity Easing” lest the acitivities of producers are dampened.
<br />The elected governments should enact laws that food wastage is controlled and healthy food distribution is effectively optimised.
<br />Every citizen should be taught that he / she empathises  the agony of hunger of any other citizen and does his / her best to provide relief. Also, people should watch the culture and habits of the leaders and officials to take necessary steps to prevent perishing and wastage of food items throughout their jurisdiction. They may in democracy reject  or modify unsuitable leaders / officers for this purpose. 
<br />In my humble opinion we the educated have a lot of obligation to bring about  the needed awareness for the above at every level of our society lest these lacunas are repeated to the detriment of future generations in the garb of some slogans or speeches or corrupt practices.
<br />Kindly write to me your comments.

<br />True development is not reflected in mere works like construction of fly overs, building up of air ports, augmented transport business, gardens for morning walks, high rise buildings, manufacture  and sale of undesirable costmetics,  free distribution of cell phones / television sets,  free electricity  or tax exemptions on some plea or qualification to a segment of the society/ societies at the expense of the rest to emerge as winners in  elections etc. 
<br />Distribution of wealth,  required education in almost all citizens and respect for systems, processes, time and human values encompassing natural principles, equity and justice which promote peace, pleasure and happiness among citizens is  fundamental for cognisition of development of society / state / nation.  
<br />It is a common observation that our current system of education is more apt to encourage cheating, law and order problems, passions, unemployable persons, gratification of certain business class needs and some activities of government/s, competition for pseudo social status etc. but not in the interest of imparting education required for having good quality citizens with full time occupation for contributing their best for the development of the nation besides enjoying a peaceful living / life among the folks where they were born. The focus of the governments should be on the latter in a true democracy for policy making, planning, funds allocation and execution.
<br />People in authority today can not walk freely without security guards around them; the security guards should be specifically trained at the cost of people’s money. Indeed in a true democracy security guards should be trained to guard the boundaries and common properties pertaining to the nation as a whole (a legal Person in the world court) within the boundaries from damage by some unwanted mindless acts especially of foreign origin but not to protect the body of a leader or his / her family round the clock. Such provision refers to want of freedom for the so called elected persons in a free nation and it is copied from one country by another country with enhanced spending from the resources. Planning should be aimed at gradual weaning of such provisions with better education and inculcation of self disciplined thinking in all and optimum stress for needed productive work.    
<br />Our education for good future work with certainty and living with required principles and personal rules for good interactions with people we handle / interact should be made available in the close proximity (say about a kilometer or so but not exceeding five kilometers). The education system should be designed to amply provide opportunity to every one willing to learn according to his / her apptitude and family background  for social needs and encourage him / her to become a good professional citizen in the surrounds without direct or indirect financial implications to the person.    
<br />To bring about true education as above people especially in the higher /university education category should as a part social obligation watch the policies and activities of the governments and their organs, impartially, discuss them among intellectuals and present the amendments also to the concerned in the authority as wellas to the public in general and pursue them to their best.  
<br />Keeping the above fundamentals in view a great amount of work shall be done to amend our approach to education system/s which plays a great role to regulate wealth distribution. People should appreciate the feeling that they learn and earn hard their requirements with a sense of pride. It is essential to do this exercise to promote the aforesaid fundamentals for cognition of developed nation. Nation means people and developed nation should be our desire. Our leaders should not only cognise but commit for the tasks invovled.

In this opportunity my mind  even today humbly salutes the charismatic leadership of “Satish Dhawan Sahib” who had great human skills for providing direction with vision, which I had the opportunity to personally enjoy in 1975 during close and short interactions when “Aryabhatta”  was launched successfully.

		<document id="f9aac0d170de82afd36c3d1c6aa058a" url=""><![CDATA[Can “Democracy” - a natural gift be today enjoyed? (Part<br/><br/>Apparently anicient Indians, though born on a very rich land, did not employ their thinking to harness the resources to their best and many did not bother about even the minimum comforts of life, which every Aadhaar card holder in India today longs after. On the other hand they had enjoyed the life contributing to many arts and knowledge of unparallel value. They had left  behind them great literature and valuable thinking besides specific methods of living  for next generations. A good grasp of these valuables coupled with relevant practice makes our journey on this earth for great understanding that ensured discipline and happiness to a large size population.  However the foreign rule over India with all its advantages and disadvantages changed the mind sets  of our population to appreciate more the material and artificial body comforts than simple living and subordinate reality / truth to artificial extravaganza / falsehood.
<br />Our current education system is commercial based and our valuations are  often more subjective than objective to determine reality / truth. We are inclined to add more significance to profit and commercial objective/s. Thus our appreciation to westernised materialism has dominated in human life.
<br />To day we need to have both materialistic as well as knowledge based spiritual outlook to travel in this journey on this earth. In fact there should be a balance between these aspects. In other words our education should be designed and developed based on this requirement throughout. The detailed design of the content for each topic is a specialised one. Hence I simply state a few things which need serious thinking to benefit the future generation.
<br />Availability of materials vary from place to place and time to time. This is a beauty of nature on earth. Elementary education should focus to gradually imparting an exhaustive knowledge (properties, growing / producing skills / techniques and application)  of all materials (both common and place specific ones) locally available. It should be designed to inculcate a system in every learner the needed habits of living healthy and  to develop focussed attention for learning as well as working with due care, sharing and love.Elementary mathematics and two languages (talking and writing) should be taught.
<br />At Secondary education level the focus should be developed for imparting latest sophisticated skills / techniques and processes available and practice of intelligent hard working, consideration for others / living units and respect for knowledge, life  resources, values and scientific principles, processes and systems. Advanced mathematics like algebra, trignometry and dynamics, computer skills / operation practice, linguistic skills keeping in view the vocabulary needs and naunces in the languages already learnt and English should be taught. The students should be explained in detail by unbiased knowledgeable experts with balance in thought and communication skills before the close of secondary education the various opportunities available in the human society at district level, state level, national and international levels and the required quality study  therefor  for making a good living and happy life for which every candidate must discern the inner urge  in a cool and calm state of mind and resolve at the right time.  
<br />At 10+2 the content shall be compartmentalised i) to form the base for different professional courses ii) to suit to entry level jobs needs in respect of knowledge and skills and iii) to prepare teachers for elementary education. The content should be designed with focus to multi variables (separate courses) keeping in view the needs of the local population upto a district level and a candidate who completes the course should be readily able to think, understand, decide and communicate well with  due difference, courtesy, clarity and keeping the welfare of the people in view. The candidate should be trained to distinguish between the needs of the work, personal strengths ( personal and those from family), and weakness (personal as well as those which may accrue from societal practices) that he / she strikes balance between desire, ambition, greed etc. to make a good living with happiness. In every stream of study the students must be explained with relevant case studies the various problems and the best solutions therefor that they learn from the experience of others the best way to work for the society and draw happiness in life. 
<br />At University level the education should be imparted with focus on objective oriented and search (Research) oriented  information dissemination. The successful students at degree level must be equipped with good unbiased understanding and analytical skills of various policies and practices prevailing in their chosen area of study and present well without bias what is good for the society. At post graduate and higher levels the candidates should be in a position to enlighten without bias or with no self set goal accomplishment  in view the public not only what is right or wrong in the current context in respect of a policy or practice and simple effective and acceptable solutions for the problems the society suffers. They should neither get disappointed nor leave their social obligation but continue their efforts incessantly to the end of happiness keeping in view  at least the following.
<br />a)	A nail can be driven into a strong wall only when its head is hammered many times.
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />	The best will always manifest when brain is stormed and our best is not always the best for all.
<br />c)	The truth will prevail sooner or later and no work should be eshewed for want of the speed desired by us for the manifestation of the desired result especially when it is  based on truth needed for the good of many around us.
<br /><br />Thus the university education should focus on dissemination of truthful information in a variety of topics / subjects / disciplines that the successful candidates do resolve and work with unparallel commitment for the good of the society and educate the rest with what is right or wrong at particular point in time and provide solutions as above.
<br />My above submission/s  is a considered effort to share my mind for a better future generation. In a democracy only the people should think, analyze and make efforts to bring about the changes needed to overcome the present and clearly visible / clouded obstacles / problems to get to real prosperity and happiness. They should share with others that others are enabled to think and work. Simple body comforts and a few hours of mental peace should not  be the lasting aim for any educated person to live happily.
<br />I trust, many of readers will understand my submissions and respond positively with their best work for the future generations. I welcome constuctive comments.

(Part<br/><br/>Earlier (Part-2) I mentioned that we need to have reforms to address the lacuna. To day in the whole India there is chaos especially regarding reforms. Why is this situation now? Is it because of globalisation and is it unavoidable? Have we not accepted globalisation or privatisation?- many such queries may strike. 
<br />Here cool is needed to understand and react.
<br />In 1991 when our economy is riddled Indian rupee was devalued to honestly accept the ground reality that subsequently fostered growth in the country. Truth will be by and large not only accepted but it will truimph. Commercial mottos like profit not only do generally ignore such reactions but also do often least regard them. In other words prudent hard decision to devalue was a necessity to project the true picture of our economy. 
<br />To day amidst global recession there is a huge gap of wealth possessions of haves and have nots. The profit motto of the rich business community which sways the country’s administration forbids them to invest in to activity/ activities either for low profits or no profit and no loss for various reasons. No new activity means no work creation and with increase in population the poor will become the poorer.  It is in fact the time for the government / s  to think about “Dharma” and take steps to overcome the problems. 
<br />51%  FDI in retail is a commercial proposition which means subordinating economic freedom of the masses to an alien. Any foreigner may be a guest and such guest should be treated like a God as per Indian tradition as far the courtesies are concerned and it is forbidden to indulge in commercial transactions with any God. This was the teaching of our ancestors and it is not in our westernised education.
<br />In federal democracy of India the Prime Minister (who should like a father of every one in the nation take care of the welfare of every citizen at national level) and the Chief Minister/s (who should take care of the people in the state without any bias for welfare) should own their “Dharma” to wards the population and act. They should not overstep their authority to either subordinate or hypothicate freedom of any one either directly or indirectly to any foreign power. They may devise ways to draw the wealth of those individuals and companies (who have more wealth over years than what they need) in to productive activities through reforms in the areas of funding, administration, taxing etc and reduce dependence on foreign trade, which ultimately shows path towards self sufficiency while avoiding undesirable manipulations for balance of payments, rupee value etc.
<br />In my humble submission reforms in the areas of funding, administration, taxing, foreign trade etc. should be the first pripority to draw our own citizens’ money into activities either directly productive or indirectly augmenting the citizen’s productive work / efforts. The current decision of 51% FDI in retail (or in any segment of commecial activity) is untimely because majority of citizens of our country can not endorse such decision happily and only time has to answer their concerns.
<br />The reforms have to be timely and they should be in the required areas based on priority they deserve keeping in view every type of freedom (to live happily) the local people are entitled to and “dharma” for the maximum population in India. 
<br /> Of course I invite constructive comments for better education.

(Part<br/><br/>No society can be without inequalities because inequality or equality is not human creation. It evolves through the process which has the eight fold nature and time as its ingradients in nature. 
<br />Naturally generated minor inequalities or inequalities with an acceptable gap among all the groups forming society that the average gap of inequality is applicable to the big majority in the society can not by and large endanger freedom. 
<br />However human beings by their expedient mind can make processes wherein a great inequality can be set up over time. Some people may become a part of their processes for some personal reasons like social commitments /needs, earning compulsions, deluded thinking, unanalysed greed etc. 
<br />Hence it becomes impossible to bring the gaps to zero. Nevertheless the human endeavour should be in place to observe the needed etiquette and extend the needed courtesies, love, service etc. to all other living units to enable good living among all. Every one should work to one’s best at any point of time with a goal and maintain a spirit of contentment while moving undauntedly further with time – the only way to enjoy freedom progressively in human life.
<br />In a democracy where the elected governments for a limited period serve in place of an experienced ancient king/s, the elected leaders  often do not cognise or rather they lose sight of such concepts as ‘Dharma’ as their basic task in preparation for future elections and personal aggrandisement from wealth, influence etc. especially during the period of power. When the leaders with mandate behave in an unrequired way the administration fails in many ways and corruption finds way easily and forcibly to the detriment of the victims of expdient human minds. Continuation of this process over a long period would be a great curse to democracy not from external aggression like war but the nation unavoidably suffers from internal unrest, low productivity and control measures both on fiscal and monetary policy variants would become meaningless because they will be for transition help. It is the “Dharma” of elected ministers to draw and execute the plans in a time bound manner for self suffiency area wise that all people in the nation get the human needs ( i.e. a) Food <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Cloths c) House with good amenities for hygenic and peaceful living d) Safety and Security e) Clean and good environment  and f) Education and Literacy g) Work / Employment to earn the needs preferably within a short distance easily and fast  approachable) satisfied. The educated and enlightened people should strive hard to ensure that the leaders discharge their required responsibilty towards the nation. People should be educated that they reject  freebees and or new luxuries / things which 
<br />i) they cannot either enjoy in their normal way of life  
<br />ii) they cannot replace with a better one for the rest of their life and
<br />iii)they have no knowledge of giving quality service from view points of	safety, durability and maintainability. 
<br />In India over 66 years of rule by elected leaders we have been a raising developing nation. The development resulted in a big gap between the rich and the poor. The urban common man has yet to be ensured the above human needs and we have become quite often dependent on traffic busy roads and stress prone life that takes way the joy of independence from human mind. In some rural areas many people do not have food to live or work to do. 
<br />To day when we have globalised / liberalised economy policies in operation there is a need that all the young educated people should take out time, think write and  organise and talk to the concerned at an appropriate time especially when things are not acceptable. For illustration when we find lacuna in gas distribution policy or petrol price rise the above educated could suggest the various solutions  for enactment  and implementation of views i.e. i.) Gas should be used as an alternative and least preferred fuel where natural fuel resources are available in plenty(in rural areas and outskirts of cities) and where there is no concern for pollution ii) Gas in all cities should be supplied only through pipes and not in cylinders iii) Gas subsidy should be gradually done away with when the social welfare measures are for all residents in cities are ensured iv) Gas being a need to cook food for urbanites it should be considered as a part of food and it should not put on par with products of commercial trade profit / loss etc. Similarly when the government/s have not planned for adequate arrangements for work / employment with in an acceptable distance for all the people from their residence it is equally be justified  to subsidise the petrol price to all the citizens as well as the public transport facilities which should increase to meet the demands of the public needs adequately; petrol, diesel or gas may be used  for power generation only when all sources and means for generation of power are absent. 
<br />In ancient Indian system there was one class (educated) which was identified to work and promote the welfare of the others without self focussed /set ambitions to do the above job i.e. advising the ruler. A good king was one who abode by the advice of such people. In our democracy people being supreme they should be advised and guided that the coming generations do have better living with good planning and execution by the elected leaders. So do write your views / comments for better education.

(Part<br/><br/>In 1838 the British Parliament wanted to explore ways and means to attract a sizable population  to comfortably rule India as a colony. In this context Lord Macaulay travelled length and breadth across India and to his amazement he could not come across a begger at all. He learnt that the ancient education system restricted begging only to “Samnyasi” who should beg as a part of his austerity daily once and not for any other purpose like gratifying desire, need etc. Education in ancient India was not a mere means to earn what we wanted to have for materialistic living but also to acquire the required knowledge with hard practice that facilitated living with balance under all situations. 
<br />To day we are educated through the system of education originally designed by the above Lord in Brish Parliament and we find it indispensable especially in the context of globalisation of various economies. Our education, we consider, is a means to do some work / job that fetches us money to live with material comforts.Unemployed people or people who despite their education are deprived of sufficient means may during their search for remedies find begging, joining the agitating  / perpetrating lot/s etc. as the easiest option /s and peace in the society is at stake. Begging, perpetration of crimes, agitations etc. --each is a sign of weakness in democracy and they may damage the human society sometimes beyond cognition to repair. In other words our education should be supplemented with required practice of some inputs for acquiring spiritual balance. These inputs should be in accordance with the individual needs which vary widely from person to person. 
<br />Of late every person is under stress some time or other and many often go astray when the path to balance was not earlier practised. Decisions adopted under stress or frustration often go awry. Want of spiritual inputs are the lacuna in such decision/s making. Consequently health, wealth, peace etc. – all are at stake and individual freedom in democracy is hardly appreciated.
<br />Every educated  parent therefore should in my humble view acquire spiritual inputs required for them as well as their family members espcially children for good practice that the next generation enjoys better democracy in their journey on this earth.
<br />By the bye quite of a few inputs one may find in my e-book “Select, Practice and Enjoy Ferraris”.
<br />You please write to share your comments for my education.

It is a long subject by itself. I write a few things here before I make quick jump to other aspects which need our attention.Awareness:-Insecurity and greed take birth in human personalities when they are either ignorant or occupied mentally with irrelevant materialistic concerns, which find way through a secert route to brain inside and affect / delude thinking for a period. Education and Guru (Guru is a kind of teacher who works in the interest of the disciple) provide answers or rather turns the person suffering from deluded thinking to normal work.It reminds me a student of prefinal engineering class whom I summoned when I was serving as principal of GND Engineering college (Bidar) on receipt of a complaint against him. A group of girls came to my chamber and told me that one of them was harassed by the boy student in love. I assured them that I would take necessary action and advised them to ignore the boy and mind their own studies. Later I called for the boy student’s record and summoned him. The boy came and told me bravely that none in this college could discipline him in his love matters. He told me that this was also conveyed to the former Principal as well as the management. He felt that he could not afford to live without the girl. I listened to him calmly till he completed what he had to say. When he emptied his mind but still he continued to say that he could not live without the girl, I told him “ Look here, I understand marriage of a boy with a girl chosen or mutually agreed. But in human life marriage comes after education i.e. after you get your degree.You want to become an engineer and joined this college.We engineers follow the order of steps in a procedure to arrive at solutions correctly every where. So if you change the order you get a wrong solution which is not appreciated anywhere.Now by changing your priority for love and married life to education you will land up into an unwanted solution which I should correct. Before I take action to correct the anamoly i.e your deluded thoughts, which I foresee, I give you three hours time. You please go, check yourself calmly and tell me what your mind is bent upon before close of the college today. I do not mind to write to your parents but I donot wait to see that students go with wrong or misplaced priorities in this college premises. Do you get me clearly?”The student nodded his head and said”Yes sir.”I said “Please go and meet me later.”Later the student met me and promised that he would finish degree first. He told me that he would behave properly. Afterwards I did not get any complaint.In the above case the boy’s mind was obsessed with an unknown desire which he could clear himself within a very short time. Extending in the way he could understand a piece of information to his brain for serious thinking was sufficient. What all I did was only that. Thus only a small timely effort to bring about awareness will correct many from falling into the trap of Adharma.Parents should therefore constantly interact with their own wards and teachers to create awareness and remove insecurity, greed and deluded thoughts tactfully in the interest of future generations and good administration / governance. This would help the nation to a great extent.I will continue in my next blog. Good day to you all.Ramanujacharyulu (18/02/2012)

Education and awareness creation together provide the solution.Want of clarity and belief in the required also put often the administration in jeopardy. Want of clarity generates confusion and doubt while want of belief in the required drives the human mind /s to keep away from the destination and introduces many time delays and cumbersome handling during the administrative process.Good documentation by sincere, knowledgeable and experienced professionals and true adoptation to what is documented provide a panacea for all deviations, which occur due to confusion and doubt.WANT OF CLARITY may be there in many places related to work, behavioural requirements and finance as well as other benefits related to employees. All the concerned employees should be well educated through training about the relevant aspects of work and administration and by giving well documented and printed material initially at the time of joining and periodically or at least when there is a new information, an instruction, material etc. is introduced.Proper clear timely communication to all the concerned is the solution to all the problems of administration connected with want of clarity.For example when a person is employed he / she should be fully told orally as well as in black and white a)what is expected of him / her;  what coduct is expected (Dos and Donots) and c) what salary and other benefits he / she would be paid currently and in the near future say a year.If a peon is promoted as a clerk a clear office order made should be handed over to the promoted employee and a copy of the order should be given to his current and new boss employees and the officer in charge of accounts while keeping an office copy in the office records.If a manager or senior officer in charge of work/s in which external and other departments are involved is promoted proper note / notice and suitable communication should be sent to all those departments for clarity in addition to office orders as above in the previous case in the organisation.Want of belief / faith in the employee about the organisation or an administrator is generated from various sources like delay in action from top, inaction, bias, personal experience of employee, grapevine etc. The solution to the problem is solved or rather the problem / s is disallowed to take birth in the administration if the following are practiced by all concerned with administration from the top to the down in the hierarchy.i) Honesty,ii) Sincerity,iii) Welfare activities,iv) With open mind “Periodical interaction” with as many employees (if not all) as can be scheduled by the administrators andv) Easy access for any employee to the administrators and records concerned for candid discussions and transparent action/s.When a person who wants to serve any organisation or even an employer he / she should watch for the above before making long term commitments with the organisation or employer lest he / she regrets later. So is the case when we choose a leader.To day many endeavour to set up their own business / organisation but fail sooner or later because of various apparent reasons the root of which if searched well may be traced among violations in respect of the above.Intellect and ego should be subdued to “Dharma” especially when a person takes responsibility which embraces the extended meaning of “Dharma”. Then the Unknown would bless success where “Dharma” is observed without any doubt and success follows through thoughts via universal medium / mind.I welcome any constructive comments. Have good time till I write and meet through another blog.Ramanujacharyulu (12/03/2012)

		<document id="6bd6bcf325c0c25e4c37c9a484ead1cd" url=""><![CDATA[Leaders and citizens in democracy (DRA-part24(A5)<br/><br/>Last time I made a mention of the common essential points which should be examined for making commitments either with any employer or a leader whom we should elect. Any employer or a leader in today world should be respected because they take up the wider aspect of Dharma as a part of their Swadharma and they should be the promoters of true independence of the citizens in a country. 
<br /><br />Democracy shall imply not only removal of any and every grievance of any citizen especially the unprivileged common citizen but also to take cognizance in advance of means and items which have potentiality to cause any such grievance for elimination. 
<br /><br />The machinery which truly serves the above concept we should in true sense of the term call as “Administration machinery” or simply “Administration”. The leaders translating this concept in to practice should be called “Administrators” and such leaders should be elected to govern or lead democracy. 
<br /><br />To amplify the above I write an illustration here.
<br /><br />A)To elect a leader let us consider that the following are essential.
<br />1.Every political leader being an Indian shall put every effort for harmonious integration of all citizens in the country.
<br />2. Every political leader should endeavour to see that his / her actions do cause shrinkage in the existing disparities between citizens and promote harmony through true independence. 
<br />3. Every political leader should be endeavour to see that essential goods and services 	are priced at affordable rates for the common person with the minimum income in any area of the nation.
<br />For simple understanding we assume the following.
<br />a)For 1 in the above the mass safe and speed transport is required e.g. Railway transport.
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />For 2 the existing disparities and population should be known i.e income, age, education, sex and health. 
<br />c)For 3 the list of essential goods and services for the common person age group wise and sex wise along with their monthly income should be obtained. 
<br /><br />We should elect a leader who knows the above. After he / she is elected we should watch how he / she works for the fulfilment of the above essentials especially if he / she is assigned the concerned ministership say  Union Railway Ministership. 
<br />Let us say the Union Railway Minister presented a budget to the nation. The educated  citizens should examine and write their comments and use the services of other elected leaders that there is progress in the above essentials and that it is fast achieved.
<br />	The railway budget proposed will have some items for revenue fetching and some expenditure items for operation and progress. Let us consider a few items for better clarity.
<br />A) Introduction of new trains:- 
<br />Here are some typical principles which should be observed by the leader for equity and justice. They are as follows.
<br />i)	All state capital cities should be linked with speedest trains to the national capital.
<br />j)	The farthest state capital should be linked with the fastest train first to the national capital.
<br />k)	All other cities in the states should be linked based on the same principle  with the cities in the other states and within the state.  
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />  Administration, safety etc.
<br />      They should be studied in depth and corrective steps for more automation should be adopted.
<br /><br />C) Revenue matters:
<br />a) “A” &amp; “B” are expenditures which has both capital and recurring concerns and it should be met with an understanding for sharing the same for “A” from  the state governments concerned. 
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> The recurring expenditure to be met by the centre should have revenue resources from its capital assets which do not burden the common citizen. The vacant property sites of railways can be fully exploited for commercial business and revenue leaving aside the commonly used platforms for boarding the train by the common citizen as a community facility / property. However if there is still deficit the minister may opt to charge high rates for platform entry providing direct entry or VIP entry to the high class compartments from  high class / VIP travellers. 
<br />     Commonly used platform should left as common citizen’s property and  for entry mere presenting any citizenship identity card should suffice. Common railway platform should be no time viewed as a source for revenue generation at least till disparities disappear.
<br />	Similarly to promote integration of nation and encourage travelling there should be 	efforts to provide more facilities and reduction of fares.     
<br />	The revenue returns may also be augmented by increasing costly amenities for 	     	high class travellers and VIPs and charging them at market prices.  
<br />c)   	Efforts should be there to reduce “Freight” charges on transport of common man’s 	goods (mostly agri produce and some products) by cross subsidising from transport of luxury and special class goods (if there were any deficit). If needed some the railway transport should be operated on BOT basis from private sector.
<br /><br />The citizens should watch their leaders for the principles of democracy in performance of their job and contribute their share for the nation. Such noble contribution rejecting lame pleadings (which enhance disparities instead of reducing) will be  the “Dharma”of citizens  and it would be of great value in the good administration of the nation.
<br /><br />My dear readers! If you any constructive comments I welcome them. Hope you will do your bit to reduce disparities and to advance to true democracy fast from the current apparent democracy in our nation.
<br />Have nice time till I write my next blog.
<br />                                            	Ramanujacharyulu (16/03/2012)

		<document id="418b7b0e4d2084530b3f21ba650f71bd" url=""><![CDATA[Leaders and citizens for true democracy (DRA-part25(A5)<br/><br/>In my previous blog I wrote that in a democracy every effort should be made to reduce disparities especially in regard to financial condition of citizens and to see that the grievances are minimised to reduce them over a period to zero.In the said context I wrote for illustration of my mind as to how the educated should impartially examine keeping the nation’s needs  like integration, disparities and poverty inview and do their bit to advance toward true democracy.
<br />Our nation is a secular country with many credentials. Also it does mean that the citizens have some customs as “Dharma”. In other words “Dharma” means customs practised over a long long period by generations. Many of our customs are today blindly followed and some follow them so from fear of some person known or unknown. Customs good should be continued for practice with out fear and those which are bad or irrelevant to the current time should be replaced with better for the good of the whole living units. This task falls into the extended “SwaDharma” of all educated citizens. It should start at home by every adult.
<br />For illustration I write a few here.
<br />1. A child learnt to say “maa”  (or “Ammaa” in some places) for accosting its own mother. The child had been admitted into a convent school and the mother went to collect the child after the school closing hours. The child saw the mother waiting and in ecstacy loudly accosted  “Maa-maa”. The mother on reaching the child slapped it with an angry look at it. The mother earlier instructed the child to accost her as “Mom” and not as “Maa” when she reaches the school to collect the child. After reaching home the child weeping loudly told the incident to its granny. The grand mother got annoyed but coaxed the child.
<br />The grandmother later told the child’s mother that the letter “Maa” referred to the auspicious rather “Mother is god (Maatru devo bhava)” and any person who repeatedly said the letter would develop a godly feeling for the mother.She advised the mother that any body who accosts/calls a lady in India either by the letter”Maa” or “Amma” should not be either insulted or punished, on the other hand such person deserves good and benevolent treatment by the lady. This is custom or “swadharma” to be observed by the caller and the called lady in India. (In the western world mother is a human being (lady) who delivered a baby but not revered as God and therefore there is  the difference)
<br />2. During a visit to India a family living abroad  was invited for  lunch in India  by a friend on a festive day at his house. The family promptly arrived for the lunch and the host received them well. After lunch they had some nice time and the family appreciated the lunch and said “Thanks” before departing. The host instead of saying immediately “Welcome” paused and joined his palms at chest saying “Adhithi devobhava! It is our fortune and pleasure to have you as our guests to day.”
<br />We see the difference in Dharma which is explicit in the words associated with the place.In India we have a tradition to think that all materials are possessed by Him and we should eat anything after giving amply to others (Adhithi) though the materials are in our custody / physical care. We have a tradition to consider that gods come to us in the form of guests. It is a humble Swadharma  of the host not only to extend the guests hearty welcome but also to treat them well till they bid adieu. In the western world people believe that the materials they offered to the guest/ s belong to them and therefore it is a faux pas if any guest leaves the place without saying “Thanks” to the host.
<br />Do we have leaders in our area who are aware of our traditional customs and swadharma and who keep them in mind while dealing with the many things whom they come across? If the answer is “Yes” we are fortunate and will soon realise our way to democracy; if not, we have our task ahead to get knowledgeable  and worthy leaders. We prepare our youngsters to become such leaders for advancing towards true democracy. 
<br />My dear visitors /readers! Please post any constructive comments I welcome them. Hope you will do your bit to get good leaders as above and to advance to true democracy fast.
<br />Very nice time to you and all your near and dear till I write my next blog.

The emperor was so passionate about the said Lord and did not want any one to worship any other God or thing in his empire. The son believed that God was everywhere and on questioning he told his father that God existed everywhere. In a rage the emperor asked the boy to show Lord Vishnu in a pillar, which the emperor struck with his mace. The emperor had divine blessings for his devoted penance that any natural thing or person that could be used to kill a human being would not kill him. Lord Vishnu appeared in the unnatural form of a Lion and human being and killed the emperor and protected the son from cruel and in human treatment. Thus Dharma was protected.

In India ancestors made clear that mind was a functional aspect of spectrum of brain in a living unit, thinking is a function related to an area in the brain and thoughts refer to memory area in human brain, which is said to have sixteen areas that get stimulated when information coupled with blood flow touch them. A human brain is said to have more than a billion neural networks associated with afferent and efferent nerve terminations; when information flows to brain through a complex phenomenon a person gets an attitude that may lead to a decision / resolve. Such a resolve can manifest in human beings in his / her behaviour in one of the ways. More details are available in e- book written by me and titled “Select, Practice and Enjoy Ferraris”.
<br />So let us ignore the inappropriate or indifferent behaviour of any one in our neighbourhood, properly respond and respect the good and favourable behaviour of any one towards us, do our best (if appropriate) to share and counsel the depressed / aggrieved to enable the concerned to enjoy and keep away and protect ourselves from behaviour of any one when we smell envy / jealousy, enmity or criminality.
