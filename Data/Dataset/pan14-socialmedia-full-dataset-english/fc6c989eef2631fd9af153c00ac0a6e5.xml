Federal or state law enforcement officers are allowed, where justified, to search your premises, car, or various other  property and assets in order to look for and seize illegal items, stolen goods or evidence of a crime. What rules must police officers follow when engaging in searches and seizures? What can they do in upholding the laws, and what can't they do?<br />What the police May Do:<br /><br />Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, law enforcement may engage in &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; searches and seizures.<br /><br />To prove that a search is &amp;quot;reasonable,&amp;quot; the police must generally show that it is more likely than not that a crime has occurred, and that if a search is conducted it is probable that they will find either stolen goods or proof of the crime.  This can be called probable cause.<br /><br />In several situations, law enforcement need to first make this showing to a judge who issues a search warrant. In most special circumstances, however, the police may be able to conduct a search without any  a warrant. In fact, nearly all searches are &amp;quot;warrantless.&amp;quot;<br /><br />Police may search and seize items or evidence when there isn't any &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy.&amp;quot; In some other words, in the event you did not have a privacy interest in the items or evidence, law enforcement can take them and, in effect, no &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; has occurred.<br /><br />Note: In deciding whether or not there was a &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy,&amp;quot; a court will give consideration to two matters:<br /><br />Did you have an expectation of some degree of privacy?<br /><br />Was that expectation reasonable in our society's view?<br /><br />Example: You have a semi-automatic rifle that you stole from a pawn shop. You leave the rifle laying on the hood of your car when you get home. You do not have a &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy&amp;quot; with regard to items you leave on the hood of your automobile, and the authorities may take the rifle. No search has occurred.<br /><br />Police may use first-hand information, or tips from an informant to justify the need to search your property. If an informant's information is used, police officers need to prove that the information is reliable under the circumstances.<br /><br />Once a warrant is obtained, law enforcement may enter onto the specified area of the property and search for the items listed on the warrant.<br /><br />Police could very well extend the search beyond the specified area of the property or include various other items in the search beyond those specified or listed in the warrant if it is necessary to:<br /><br />Ensure their safety or the safety of others;<br /><br />Prevent the destruction of evidence;<br /><br />Discover more about possible evidence or stolen items that are in plain view; or<br /><br />Hunt for evidence or stolen items which, primarily based upon their initial search of the specified area, they believe may be in a different location on the property.<br /><br />Example: Police officers have a warrant to search your basement for evidence of a drug manufacturing operation. On their way through your home to go down to the basement, they see a cache of weapons sitting on the kitchen table. Some might take the guns in order to ensure their safety while searching your basement.<br /><br />Police may search your property without a warrant in the event you consent to the search. Consent must be freely and voluntarily given, and you can't  be coerced or tricked into giving it.<br /><br />Police may search your person and the immediate surroundings without a warrant when they are placing you under arrest.<br /><br />If an individual is arrested in a home, law enforcement may make a &amp;quot;protective sweep&amp;quot; of the home in order to make a &amp;quot;cursory visual inspection&amp;quot; of places where an accomplice may be hiding. In order to accomplish this, law enforcement must have a reasonable belief that an accomplice may be around.<br /><br />Example: The authorities arrest you in your living room on criminal charges of murder. They may open the door of your coat closet to make sure that no one else is hiding there, but may not open your medicine cabinet because an accomplice couldn't hide there.<br /><br />When you are being taken to jail, police may perform an &amp;quot;inventory search&amp;quot; of items you have with you without any  a warrant. This search may include your automobile if it is being held by law enforcement in order to make a list of all items inside.<br />  Police may search  without having  a warrant should they reasonably fear for their safety or for the public's safety.<br /><br />Example: If the authorities drive past your property on a regular patrol of the neighborhood and see you, in your open garage, with ten cases of dynamite and a blowtorch, they may search your garage  without having  a warrant.<br /><br />If it's required to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence, police officers may search without any  a warrant.<br /><br />Example: If police officers see you trying to burn a stack of money that you stole from a bank, they could perform a search without any  a warrant to avoid you from further destroying the cash.<br /><br />Perform a search, without a warrant, when they are in &amp;quot;hot pursuit&amp;quot; of a suspect who enters a private dwelling or area following fleeing the scene of a crime.<br /><br />Example: If law enforcement are chasing you from the scene of a murder, and you run into your apartment in an attempt to get away from them, they can follow you into the apartment and search the area without a warrant.<br /><br />Police may perform a pat-down of your outer clothing, in what is called a &amp;quot;stop and frisk&amp;quot; situation, as long as they reasonably believe that you may be concealing a weapon and they fear for their safety.<br /><br />Houston Search &amp;amp; Seisure Defense: Hire the Most Respected Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer:<br />  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Ftheft.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/theft.html</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com%2Fdrugcharges.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com/drugcharges.html</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a><br />What police officers May NOT Do:<br /><br />The police may not perform a warrantless search anywhere you have a reasonable expectation of privacy, unless one of the warrant exceptions applies.<br /><br />If evidence was acquired through an unreasonable or illegal search, the authorities may not use it against you in a trial. This is  designated the &amp;quot;exclusionary rule.&amp;quot;<br /><br />The law enforcement may not use evidence resulting from an illegal search to find some other evidence.<br /><br />The law enforcement may not submit an affidavit in support of obtaining a search warrant if they did not have a reasonable belief in the truth of the statements within the affidavit.<br /><br />Unless there is a reasonable suspicion that it contains evidence, unlawful items, or stolen goods, law enforcement may not search your automobile. If your car has been seized by law enforcement, however, they can search it.<br /><br />Unless they have a reasonable suspicion that you are involved in a criminal activity, the police may not &amp;quot;stop and frisk&amp;quot; you. If they have a reasonable suspicion, they may pat down your outer clothing if they are concerned that you might be concealing a weapon.<br /><br />Houston Search &amp;amp; Seisure Defense: Hire the Most Respected Houston Criminal Defense Attorney<br />Courts often have to determine case-by-case whether or not the circumstances in which the authorities searched without a warrant were legal. Therefore, any time a search has already occurred and you aren't sure of its legality, talk to the Leading Houston Lawyer as soon as possible. And any time a search has not yet been conducted, make sure that you understand your legal rights in advance.

If you have been accused of domestic violence, you may possibly be facing an uphill battle.<br /><br />Speak with the Recommended Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer to be able to discuss your case and create a strategy for fighting the charges.<br />              Domestic Assault Defined<br />              Domestic assault is both physical violence and emotional abuse, including threats, intimidation and control. Domestic violence is most often an assault or battery against a spouse, intimate partner or cohabitant, but it can also occur against a minor, elderly relative or other member of the household or family. <br />              Domestic Assault Arrest<br />              A conviction of felony or misdemeanor domestic assault can result in severe penalties. The defendant may perhaps serve time in prison or jail; pay steep fines; undergo anger management or other counseling; and suffer personal repercussions like divorce, loss of child custody or an unfavorable property settlement during divorce proceedings.<br />              Domestic assault is taken seriously by law enforcement personnel and prosecutors. It is vital to be able to have a competent, experienced defense attorney on your side. Lawyer Charles Johnson will stand by your side and safeguard your legal rights.<br />              Although the procedures and policies vary by jurisdiction, domestic assault arrests and charges usually follow a general pattern. When the police are called to a residence, by an alleged victim or someone else, they will likely appraise the situation and determine whether there is probable cause in order to arrest the person accused of domestic assault.<br />              At the arraignment, the defendant will learn about the specific charges against him or her, and the defendant's lawyer will speak with the defendant about what kind of plea to enter. The judge will decide whether the defendant should be granted bail and, if so, how much the bail is going to be.<br />In many court cases, the defendant shall be ordered to have no contact &amp;mdash; direct or indirect &amp;mdash; with the alleged victim. Therefore the defendant cannot go back home, if that's where the victim lives, and the defendant must not call or get in touch with the victim.<br />In some jurisdictions, even if the victim decides not to go forward with the criminal charges, the case will continue. A variety of reasons, based on both history and public policy, tend to be behind this practice.<br />Houston Domestic Assault Defense: Hire the Finest Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer:<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F681414%2Fjournal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystrength.org/people/681414/journal</a> , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FMost-Dedicated-Houston-Lawyer--Coping-With-Probation--What-You-Should-Consider%2F03EFBFFFF023ED28400080154FCE8%3Fref_title%3Drickeyhouse819%26amp%3Bref_url%3Dhttp%253a%252f%252fcommunity.atom.com%252fprofile%252f084D23E02023ED2840001023ED284%252fContent%252fPost%252fMyPosts2.aspx%26amp%3Bref_ucid%3D84D23E02023ED2840001023ED284"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Most-Dedicated-Houston-Lawyer--Coping-With-Probation--What-You-Should-Consider/03EFBFFFF023ED28400080154FCE8?ref_title=rickeyhouse819&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.atom.com%2fprofile%2f084D23E02023ED2840001023ED284%2fContent%2fPost%2fMyPosts2.aspx&amp;ref_ucid=84D23E02023ED2840001023ED284</a> , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Frickeyhouse819%2Fmost-qualified-houston-lawyer-coping-with-probation-what-you-ought-to-know"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/rickeyhouse819/most-qualified-houston-lawyer-coping-with-probation-what-you-ought-to-know</a> <br />              As the justice system has come to understand the social and legal results of domestic violence, the penalties for conviction of domestic assault have become steeper.

		<document id="a34c553d8df9ac35408a075b049ba651" url=""><![CDATA[Top Houston Criminal Defense Attorney » Search & Seizur<br/><br/><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.Houstonlawyer.com</a> <br />Although individuals within the U.S. are entitled to privacy and freedom from government intrusion, there is a limit to that privacy. Federal or state police officers are permitted, where justified, to search your premises, car, or some other assets  in order to look for and seize unlawful items, stolen goods or evidence of a transgression. What rules must law enforcement follow when engaging in searches and seizures? What can they do in upholding the laws, and what can't they do?<br />What law enforcement May Do:<br /><br />Under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, police may engage in &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; searches and seizures.<br /><br />To establish that a search is &amp;quot;reasonable,&amp;quot; police officers must generally demonstrate that it is more likely than not that a crime has transpired, and that if a search is conducted it is probable that they will find either stolen goods or evidence of the criminal offense. This is often  named  probable cause.<br /><br />In some situations, the authorities need to first make this showing to a judge who issues a search warrant. In many special circumstances, however, the authorities may be able to conduct a search  without the need of a warrant. In fact, the majority of searches are &amp;quot;warrantless.&amp;quot;<br /><br />Police may search and seize items or evidence when there is absolutely no &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy.&amp;quot; In other words, should you didn't have a privacy interest in the items or evidence, police officers can take them and, in effect, no &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; has transpired.<br /><br />Note: In deciding whether there was a &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy,&amp;quot; a court will take into consideration two things:<br /><br />Did you have an expectation of some degree of privacy?<br /><br />Was that expectation reasonable in our society's view?<br /><br />Example: You have a semi-automatic rifle that you had stolen from a pawn shop. You leave the rifle laying on the hood of your automobile when you get home. You don't have a &amp;quot;legitimate expectation of privacy&amp;quot; with regard to things you leave on the hood of your vehicle, and the police may take the weapon. No search has transpired.<br /><br />Police may use first-hand info, or tips from an informant to justify the need to search your property. If an informant's info is utilized, the authorities must establish that the information is reliable under the circumstances.<br /><br />Once a warrant is obtained, the police may enter onto the specified area of the property and search for the items listed on the warrant.<br /><br />Police could possibly extend the search beyond the specified area of the property or include other items in the search beyond those specified or listed within the warrant if it is required to:<br /><br />Ensure their safety or the safety of others;<br /><br />Prevent the destruction of evidence;<br /><br />Discover more about possible evidence or stolen items that are in plain view; or<br /><br />Hunt for evidence or stolen items that, dependent upon their initial search of the specified area, they believe may be in a different location on the property.<br /><br />Example: The authorities have a warrant to search your basement for evidence of a drug manufacturing operation. On their way through your house to go down to the basement, they see a cache of firearms sitting on your kitchen table. Some may take the guns in order to ensure their safety while searching your basement.<br /><br />Police may search your property  without the need of a warrant should you consent to the search. Consent has to be freely and voluntarily given, and you cannot be coerced or tricked into giving it.<br /><br />Police may search your person and the immediate surroundings  without the need of a warrant when they are placing you under criminal arrest.<br /><br />If an individual is arrested in a residence, law enforcement officials may make a &amp;quot;protective sweep&amp;quot; of the residence in order to make a &amp;quot;cursory visual inspection&amp;quot; of places where an accomplice may be hiding. In order to do this, the authorities must have a reasonable belief that an accomplice may be around.<br /><br />Example: Law enforcement arrest you inside your living room on charges of murder. Some may open the door of your coat closet to make sure that nobody else is hiding there, but may not open your medicine cabinet due to the fact that an accomplice couldn't hide there.<br /><br />When you are being taken to jail, law enforcement officials may perform an &amp;quot;inventory search&amp;quot; of items you have with you  without the need of a warrant. This search may include your vehicle if it is being held by police officers in order to make a list of all items inside.<br />  Police may search without any  a warrant if they reasonably fear for their safety or for the public's safety.<br /><br />Example: If law enforcement drive past your home on a regular patrol of the neighborhood and see you, inside your open garage, with ten cases of dynamite and a blowtorch, they can search your garage without any  a warrant.<br /><br />If it's necessary to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence, law enforcement may search  without having  a warrant.<br /><br />Example: If the authorities see you trying to burn a stack of money that you stole from a bank, they can perform a search  without the need of a warrant to prevent you from further destroying the cash.<br /><br />Perform a search, without any  a warrant, if they are in &amp;quot;hot pursuit&amp;quot; of a suspect who enters a private dwelling or area subsequent to fleeing the scene of a crime.<br /><br />Example: If the police are chasing you from the scene of a murder, and you run into your apartment in an attempt to get away from them, they may follow you into the apartment and search the area  without the need of a warrant.<br /><br />Police may perform a pat-down of your outer clothing, in what is  designated a &amp;quot;stop and frisk&amp;quot; situation, as long as they reasonably believe that you may be concealing a firearm and they fear for their safety.<br /><br />Houston  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fsearchandseizure.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/searchandseizure.html</a>  Defense: Hire the Top Houston Attorney:<br />   <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrugcharges.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drugcharges.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrunkdriving.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drunkdriving.html</a> <br />What the authorities May NOT Do:<br /><br />The law enforcement officials may not perform a warrantless search anywhere you have a reasonable expectation of privacy, unless one of the warrant exceptions applies.<br /><br />If evidence was obtained through an unreasonable or unlawful search, law enforcement may not use it against you in a trial. This is often  named  the &amp;quot;exclusionary rule.&amp;quot;<br /><br />The police may not use evidence resulting from an unlawful search to obtain some other evidence.<br /><br />The law enforcement officials may not submit an affidavit in support of obtaining a search warrant if they didn't have a reasonable belief in the truth of the statements in the affidavit.<br /><br />Unless there is a reasonable suspicion that it contains evidence, illegal items, or stolen goods, police officers may not search your vehicle. If your automobile has been seized by the police, however, they can search it.<br /><br />Unless they have a reasonable suspicion that you are involved in a criminal activity, the authorities may not &amp;quot;stop and frisk&amp;quot; you. If they have a reasonable suspicion, they can pat down your outer clothing if they are concerned that you could be concealing a firearm.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fsearchandseizure.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/searchandseizure.html</a> : Hire the Top Houston Drug Crimes Lawyer<br />Courts often need to determine case-by-case whether the circumstances in which the police searched without a warrant had been legal.

Sadly, it is all-too-easy to move drugs along the interstate highway system in all directions. In particular within the Houston region, our law enforcement officers have noticed patterns when searching for drug traffickers. It's typical for cars to be stopped along northbound interstates and for big amounts of drugs to be discovered. When suspicious vehicles are stopped heading southbound, large amounts of currency are sometimes discovered. Whether the criminal charge will be sale, distribution, or drug trafficking will depend upon the kind and the quantity of drugs in question. However the difference you face in penalties is substantial.<br />A first degree felony drug conviction typically results in a minimum five-year prison term, but in large-scale drug manufacturing or drug distribution cases, jail terms might jump to a minimum of Fifteen years.<br />If excessively significant sums of United States currency are discovered inside your vehicle (or perhaps a vehicle you are riding in), you might encounter  criminal charges of money laundering. Amazingly, the penalties at the federal level for possessing substantial amounts of cash are similarly severe to those for possessing large amounts of drugs.<br />You might also find yourself facing conspiracy criminal charges, something federal prosecutors might add on to drug crime cases.<br />The Finest Houston Drug Crimes Attorney will have handled numerous state and federal drug cases in Texas courts, from drug manufacturing cases involving meth labs and marijuana grow houses to international drug trafficking.

This indicates they not just confiscate drugs; they also seize money, vehicles, boats, various other personal  property and assets and even real estate. The police or law enforcement agency can then sell the assets  and keep the proceeds or just keep the  property and assets altogether for their own uses. This is particularly common with automobiles.<br />Asset forfeiture sometimes goes too far, with the police taking property that doesn't belong to anybody charged with the criminal offense, property that in fact belongs to totally innocent family members or third parties. The Top Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer handles asset forfeiture cases, helping customers fight to recover seized property. <br />Building Your Drug Manufacture Defense<br />Most drug manufacture criminal charges, whether or not they involve marijuana or methamphetamines, are heard in state court.

		<document id="77ecbbe7a24dce5faad47ae6911482b6" url=""><![CDATA[Top Houston Criminal Defense Attorney » Dealing With Probat<br/><br/>As an alternative to sentencing a defendant to a jail term, a judge could possibly choose to sentence a defendant to probation. Probation releases a defendant back into the community, however the defendant doesn't  have the same degree of liberty as a normal citizen. Probation comes with conditions that restrict a probationer's behavior, and if the probationer violates one of those conditions, the court could possibly revoke or modify the probation.<br />Courts generally grant probation for first-time or low-risk offenders. Statutes determine when probation is possible, nevertheless it is up to the sentencing judge to determine whether or not to actually grant probation.<br />              Houston Criminal Defense: Hire the Top Houston Attorney<br />               Even though sentencing judges have this latitude, they must still stay within the statutory limits when granting probation. For instance, a judge can't impose probation for a period longer than the maximum sentence prescribed by statute.<br />              Probation has three primary goals:<br /><br />To rehabilitate the defendant<br /><br />To safeguard society from further criminal conduct by the defendant<br /><br />To protect the legal rights of the victims<br /><br />Once a judge has granted probation, the matter moves into the jurisdiction of probation officers, who monitor the probationer&amp;rsquo;s compliance with the terms of the probation.<br />              Probation Conditions<br />              Conditions are an inherent part of probation. Judges set conditions in order to meet the goals for probation stated above. A probationer must comply with these conditions or else the court could possibly impose a jail sentence or add more restrictive conditions to their probation.<br />              Courts frequently have a great deal of discretion when setting probation conditions, however that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that judges can set whatever terms they desire. Probation conditions must be reasonable. This means that the conditions can never be vindictive, vague, overbroad or arbitrary. In addition, the conditions must be related to the protection of the public. Also, any time a judge wishes to impose special conditions, those conditions need to relate to the nature of the transgression that the probationer committed.<br />              Judges set the conditions, nevertheless probation officers enforce them. In cases where a probation officer finds probable cause to believe that the probationer has violated the terms of the probation, the judge could very well either change the terms of the probation or revoke the probation and impose a prison sentence.<br />              Probation Revocation<br />              Because the probationer&amp;rsquo;s freedom is at stake, however, the probationer should receive some procedural due process before a court revokes their probation. While the decision to revoke probation, just like the judgment to grant probation, is at the court&amp;rsquo;s discretion, the court should go through several procedural requirements prior to revoking probation. The probationer defending revocation doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as many legal rights during revocation proceedings as they do during the original criminal trial, however.<br />              In order to revoke probation, a court needs to provide the probationer with notice of the proposed revocation and conduct a hearing on the matter. The probationer has a right to testify at the hearing, present supporting witnesses, and confront the witnesses against them. The probationer also has a right to a neutral hearing body, and must receive a written statement containing the reasons for revoking probation.<br />If there is sufficient evidence, a violation of even a single condition might lead to revocation of probation. The violated condition needs to be valid, however. If a condition is later on found to be unreasonable then violation of that condition will not constitute grounds for revocation.<br />              Houston Probation: Hire the Most Effective Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrunkdriving.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drunkdriving.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrugcharges.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drugcharges.html</a> <br />              If you are accused of violating the terms of your parole or probation or have questions relating to a potential probation criminal offense, remember to call the Leading Houston Criminal Defense Lawyer anytime for a free preliminary consultation.

Even after you've paid your debt to society, your criminal history can make it difficult to get your life back. Luckily, the majority of states give you a way to set the record straight: Expungement.<br />Houston Record Expungement Defense:  Hire the Top Houston Attorney<br /><br />Expungement is a legal process through which an arrest or conviction could possibly be erased from a person's criminal record. Below you'll find links to in-depth advice on Expunction, and state-specific resources on Expungement and criminal records.<br /><br />Expungement Basics - Introductory advice on Expunction and its legal effects.<br />  Eligibility for Expunction - A charge or conviction often must meet certain standards in order to qualify for Expunction.<br />  The Expunction Process - A number of steps should be taken before an Expungement is granted.<br />  Expungement is not Always an Option - Expungement is not obtainable in all jurisdictions, and may not be an option for certain arrests or convictions.<br /><br />Expunction Basics<br />Expungement (also called &amp;quot;expunction&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> is known as a court-ordered process in which the legal record of an arrest or a criminal conviction is &amp;quot;sealed,&amp;quot; or erased in the eyes of the law. When a conviction is expunged, the process may also be called &amp;quot;setting aside a criminal conviction.&amp;quot; The availability of Expungement, and the procedure for getting a charge or conviction expunged, will vary according to the state or county in that the arrest or conviction occurred.<br />Legal Effect of an Expungement<br />An Expungement ordinarily means that a charge or conviction is &amp;quot;sealed,&amp;quot; or erased from a person's criminal record for most purposes. After the Expungement process is complete, a charge or a criminal conviction ordinarily  doesn't necessarily have to be disclosed by the individual who has been arrested or convicted. By way of example, when filling out an application for a job or apartment, an applicant whose charge or conviction has been expunged does not need to disclose that arrest or conviction.<br />In most cases, no record of an expunged arrest or conviction will show up if the potential employer, educational institution, or various other company conducts a public records inspection or background search of an individual's criminal background.<br />An expunged charge or conviction  isn't really necessarily completely erased, in the literal sense of the word. An Expungement will ordinarily be an accessible part of a person's criminal background, viewable by certain government agencies, which includes police officers and the criminal courts. This limited accessibility is in some cases referred to as a criminal record being &amp;quot;under seal.&amp;quot; In certain legal proceedings, most notably during sentencing for any sort of offenses committed after an Expungement, or in immigration / deportation proceedings, an expunged conviction that may be &amp;quot;under seal&amp;quot; may very well still be considered as proof of a previous conviction.<br />Expungement Eligibility<br />When Expunction of an arrest or conviction is an option in a state or county, in most instances a person's criminal record should meet certain standards in order to qualify for the process.<br />Whether or not an individual is eligible for Expungement will usually depend on a number of factors, such as:<br /><br />The amount of time which has passed since the arrest or conviction<br />  The severity and nature of the event for that Expungement is sought (i.e. a conviction for a sex criminal offense may very well result in a denial of Expungement)<br />  Events within the applicant's criminal record (such as arrests or convictions in all jurisdictions, not simply the offender's state/county)<br />  The severity and nature of various other events within the applicant's criminal record<br /><br />Special eligibility rules might exist for Expunction of arrests or convictions that occurred while the offender was a juvenile, and arrests or convictions for sex crimes. Be sure to contact the Recommended Houston Attorney to talk about your available options.<br />The Expunction Process<br />Where available to persons who've been arrested or found guilty, Expungement  doesn't necessarily transpire automatically, and is never guaranteed. A person wanting to have an arrest or criminal conviction expunged from their record must usually fill out an application or petition, and submit the paperwork to the appropriate criminal court for a judge's evaluation and decision. In most jurisdictions, a fee should be paid in conjunction with the filing of the application.<br />The Expungement process might be complicated. For instance, several jurisdictions require an applicant to deliver (or &amp;quot;serve&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> papers on district attorneys, while others require the applicant to prepare the legal document (or &amp;quot;Order of Expungement&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> that will undoubtedly be signed by the judge. In many cases, a court hearing is required, after which a judge will decide whether or not to grant the Expunction.<br />The Most Effective Houston Criminal Defense Attorney  will be able to assist you with this complex process.<br />Expungement  is not really  Always an Option<br />It is critical to understand that Expunction of an arrest and/or a criminal conviction isn't  an option in all states and counties (called &amp;quot;jurisdictions&amp;quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />. Dependent upon the jurisdiction in that the arrest or conviction happened:<br /><br />Expunction could very well not be available at all<br />  Expungement may very well be an option for arrests, yet not for convictions<br />  Expunction may perhaps be an option only for certain criminal convictions<br />  Expunction may perhaps be an option only for arrests and/or convictions that occurred when the offender was a juvenile<br />  Expungement could very well be attainable only after an individual is acquitted (cleared) of an offense (i.e. criminal charges are dismissed)<br />  Expunction may very well be possible only when a criminal conviction is reversed (i.e. after an effective appeal of the conviction).<br /><br />Hire The Most Qualified Houston Criminal Defense Attorney: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houstonlawyer.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.houstonlawyer.com</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrugcharges.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drugcharges.html</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhoustonlawyer.com%2Fdrunkdriving.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://houstonlawyer.com/drunkdriving.html</a> <br />In Texas, criminal record expunction or an action to seal your criminal record can help you move on with your life.

A conviction on drug possession charges could have severe implications for you mainly because of the likelihood that you might have to go to jail and pay stiff fines reaching into the thousands of dollars, as well as the possibility the police could possibly seize your car or other property.  Drug possession charges will follow you with a criminal record that can certainly also keep you from certain jobs and professional licenses. If you are charged under the possession law, it means the state has charged you with transporting or having access to a controlled substance such as marijuana, cocaine,, or Ecstasy. <br />                A drug possession conviction could possibly bring about a 6 month driver's  license suspension under Texas statutes, therefore it is a good idea to speak with an criminal defense lawyer to discover alternatives to pleading guilty in the event you require the ability to drive. The police might charge you with drug possession if they find drugs in your pockets or anywhere else on your body, or they can charge you under a claim of &quot;constructive possession&quot;. That means the drugs had been in a place that you normally control or could very easily reach, that could be your car, your apartment, or the cushions of a couch where you had been sitting when police officers entered. <br />Hire the Most Qualified Houston Criminal Defense Attorney!

The level of misdemeanor or felony charge is primarily based on the quantity of drugs confiscated. By way of example, possession of five ounces of marijuana would lead to state felony charges with a sentence potential as high as $10,000 and two years in jail.<br />A drug possession conviction may lead to criminal penalties, that include fines and time in jail, and other penalties, such as license suspension, damage to reputation and loss of ability to obtain student loan financing. The Leading Houston Drug Crimes Attorney will endeavor to lessen or altogether avoid such drastic consequences through providing zealous defense counsel.            Drug Possession Sentencing<br />              Judges will usually attempt to figure out if the drugs had been for personal use or drug possession for sale and distribution when sentencing. Often the fines are quite significant and often the sentence includes at least random drug testing and probation if not some incarceration. Drug awareness classes and community service hours are quite often the first option for the majority of judges, once it has been established that the drugs had been for personal use.<br /><br />A skilled criminal defense lawyer will be able to help prove this, or even establish that the drugs were definitely not yours in situations where they had been recovered from a vehicle or residence.<br />Protect Your Legal Rights               You have a right to remain silent and the right to an attorney - use them. The Leading Houston  Criminal Lawyer  investigates the methods in which the evidence was acquired in order to uncover violations of your constitutional rights.<br /><br />Elicited confessions and the confiscated drugs are quite often the only evidence creating a case against you. This might provide leverage in plea negotiations and even lead to dismissal of drug charges. Any type of evidence that is obtained in violation of your rights is inadmissible in court - meaning the evidence can't be employed in a case against you. Any time a confession was acquired unlawfully or unlawful drugs had been confiscated with an invalid search warrant (illegal search and seizure), your attorney should fight to suppress the evidence. As an experienced drug possession criminal defense lawyer, Charles Johnson understands how to mitigate detrimental evidence.Will I have to go to Prison on my Drug Possession Criminal Charge?<br />              State possession law enables counties to set up diversion programs for those arrested for crimes involving the use or possession of drugs, including marijuana. And, judges must give probation, or community supervision, in certain drug possession cases.<br /><br />The state health code also requires any county with a populace greater than 200,000 to establish a drug court program to send some drug offenders to treatment instead of jail.     The punishment primarily is dependent on the amount of drugs concerned and your prior conviction history, but it is very possible you may perhaps not have to serve time for a drug possession conviction if it is your first offense for a relatively small amount./p&gt;<br />              The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure makes community supervision and mandatory drug treatment programs a sentencing requirement for men and women found guilty of possessing:<br /><br />Less than one pound of marijuana.<br />Less than 5 units of drugs most notably LSD.<br />Less than 1 gram of drugs that include crack or meth.<br />Less than 1 gram of drugs that include Ecstasy (MMDA) or PCP.      <br />              Even so, the judge does not have to sentence you to probation if you have been found guilty of a prior felony, or in the event you have violated an earlier probation sentence. In those court cases, it is up to the judge whether or not you go to prison or get probation. <br /><br />If your attorney can show the officers  did not have probable cause, your consent, or a search warrant, your attorney could possibly be able to challenge the legality of the search that turned up those drugs and get the evidence suppressed, keeping the state from making its case against you.<br /><br />To do that, the prosecutor  needs to show  that law enforcement found the drugs on you or in your control following a legal search. The judge may also sentence you to serve three to six months in jail before you start probation. But remember, the state  has to first prove  the criminal charge of drug possession before you can be sentenced. Make sure you get in touch with your lawyer for a no charge consultation on your Texas drug possession charge, and your lawyer will walk you through the details of your case, and your  optimal legal defense options. As you can certainly see, drug possession court cases get complex very quickly.<br />Hire The Most Effective Houston Drug Possession Defense Attorney: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Frickeyhouse819%2Fmost-dedicated-houston-criminal-defense-attorney-no-one-should-ever-defend-themselves-in-a-courtroom"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/rickeyhouse819/most-dedicated-houston-criminal-defense-attorney-no-one-should-ever-defend-themselves-in-a-courtroom</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Frickeyhouse819%2Fleading-houston-assault-lawyer-no-individual-needs-to-ever-defend-themselves-in-a-courtroom"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/rickeyhouse819/leading-houston-assault-lawyer-no-individual-needs-to-ever-defend-themselves-in-a-courtroom</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FLeading-Houston-Lawyer----No-Person-Ought-To-Ever-Defend-Themselves-In-A-Court-Of-Law%2F03EFBFFFF023ED284000801553A84%3Fref_title%3Drickeyhouse819%26amp%3Bref_url%3Dhttp%253a%252f%252fcommunity.atom.com%252fprofile%252f084D23E02023ED2840001023ED284%252fContent%252fPost%252fMyPosts2.aspx%26amp%3Bref_ucid%3D84D23E02023ED2840001023ED284"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Leading-Houston-Lawyer----No-Person-Ought-To-Ever-Defend-Themselves-In-A-Court-Of-Law/03EFBFFFF023ED284000801553A84?ref_title=rickeyhouse819&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.atom.com%2fprofile%2f084D23E02023ED2840001023ED284%2fContent%2fPost%2fMyPosts2.aspx&amp;ref_ucid=84D23E02023ED2840001023ED284</a> <br />              If you are defending misdemeanor or felony drug possession charges following a drug charge in Texas, preserve your protection under the law and future.
