<br />Reporting from Washington-
<br />A top senator, angry that Facebook Inc. failed to quit millions of preteens from making use of its social networking internet site, accused co-founder Mark Zuckerberg of lacking “social values” and becoming far more concerned with creating the firm than with children’s privacy.
<br />“It really is my common feeling that folks who are 20, 21, 22 years old actually don’t have any social values at this point,” Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) told one more top Facebook executive at a hearing Thursday.
<br />“I feel he was focused on how the organization model would function,” Rockefeller stated about Zuckerberg, who was a 19-year-old Harvard student when he designed Facebook in 2004. “He wanted to make it bigger and faster and greater than anybody else ever had.”
<br />The company’s policy calls for users to be at least 13, a move developed to steer clear of federal regulations for sites employed by young children. But a current Consumer Reports survey identified that about 7.5 million active Facebook users were younger than 13.
<br />Rockefeller’s comments came as a Facebook executive for the initial time came below congressional quizzing in a current round of hearings about concerns that technologies businesses are not protecting individual privacy. Executives from Apple Inc. and Google Inc., which sent witnesses to a hearing last week, also appeared at Thursday’s hearing before a Commerce subcommittee.
<br />Rockefeller, a crucial player on technology concerns, and other lawmakers are thinking about new regulations to defend on-line privacy, particularly for children. The problem has gained momentum with the current revelation that an obscure file on iPhones and iPads could shop thousands of detailed records of a user’s whereabouts.

<br /><br />Starships, warp speed, transporters, phasers. Think Star Trek technology is only the stuff of fiction? Think again.
<br /><br />Dr. Peter Jansen, a PhD graduate of the Cognitive Science Laboratory at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, has developed a scientific measurement device based on the tricorders used by Captain Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy and other space adventurers on the classic TV series that has spawned numerous spin-offs in more than 45 years.
<br /><br />“Star Trek inspired me to be a scientist” said Jansen, who has been formally working on his tricorder prototypes since 2007, but toying with the idea of making a functioning device since he was “a kid in high school.”
<br /><br />Advertisement: Story continues below
<br />The 29-year-old Jansen’s school days spanned the late 1990s when Star Trek: Voyager was on the air. It featured his favorite tricorder, a model with screens on top and bottom.
<br /><br />The first tricorder appeared on the original show’s initial episode in 1966, when Capt. Kirk swaggered toward audiences with his phaser weapon holstered to his side but a tricorder in his hand. The hand-held devices for data sensing, analysis and recording, have been a part of Star Trek ever since.
<br /><br />But if Jansen, a self-confessed “addicted maker” of things, is successful at developing, testing and bringing his instrument into the public, the tricorder may not be just the stuff of Star Trek prop rooms. It may be used for real.
<br /><br />Jansen said his tricorder can take atmospheric measurements, or ambient temperature, pressure or humidity. It can take electromagnetic measurements to test magnetic fields, and it can make spatial measurements of distance, location, or motion.
<br /><br />Fascinating, as Spock might say.
<br /><br />Jansen thinks of his tricorder as a “general tool” – a kind of “Swiss Army Knife” – with practical uses in building inspection, for instance, where it might help taking temperature and humidity readings or be a distance sensor to measure rooms.
<br /><br />It resembles the device carried by countless “Away Team” members in Star Trek – The Next Generation – his favorite of the Star Trek shows, he notes.
<br /><br />No science fiction
<br /><br />No independent group has yet verified his claims for the device which, he said, is one reason for placing his designs on a public website as an “open source” that technology makers can utilize to test and tinker.
<br /><br />Jansen has posted schematics and designs of his first and second prototypes, the Mark 1 and Mark 2, for anyone to see and build. Jansen expects to have his latest version, the Mark 4, produced for “about $200.”
<br /><br />“Everything you need to build one is on line” at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tricorderproject.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.tricorderproject.org</a>, said Jansen. He hopes others will follow his lead.
<br /><br />While it may sound like the stuff of science fiction, Jansen isn’t the only one to take notice of just how useful a real functioning tricorder would be – especially as a medical tool.
<br /><br />Telecommunications giant Qualcomm this year launched the “Tricorder X-Prize Contest” with the slogan “Healthcare in the palm of your hand.” Qualcomm hopes to motivate developers with a $US10 million prize to make medical tricorders a reality.
<br /><br />Wanda Moebus of the Advanced Medical Technology Association, who is not affiliated with Jansen or Qualcomm, told Reuters the X-Prize “is really cool,” but cautioned that making a real medical tricorder device “would have to be measured on its safety and effect, like all other medical technologies.”
<br /><br />Jansen said he has been approached by “a couple of teams” about the X Prize, but added that his prototypes are more for science research than medical tools.
<br /><br />Besides, he said he already is on to his next frontier, making a sort of “replicator,” another Star Trek device that will create 3D objects and foods that are dimensional copies of real items.
<br /><br />Jansen’s “replicator” is a 3D printer, which in itself is not really new, but the scientist thinks about it in terms reminiscent of Star Trek’s famous prologue. It’s “like nothing we’ve ever seen before,” Jansen said.

<br /><br />Many investment policies have guideline asset allocations that target a constant 
<br />proportional weighting between stocks and bonds during both bull and bear markets.  A 
<br />“Constant Mix” asset management approach is defensible under a variety of commonly 
<br />held assumptions.  Generally, a recommendation to “stay the course” during volatile 
<br />market conditions implicitly assumes that investors, will benefit from a Constant Mix 
<br />approach.  Investors, however, are not a homogeneous group; and, for some, changes in 
<br />wealth may cause changes in risk tolerance.  Wealth management, therefore, may require 
<br />dynamic changes in both asset allocation as well as other aspects of investment policy 
<br />such as rebalancing, distribution and monitoring &amp;amp; surveillance policies.   
<br />This article outlines several asset management approaches and discusses the importance 
<br />of aligning Investment Policy with investor risk preferences.  If the investment policy 
<br />ignores this critical “calibration,” there is little hope that the investor will be able to 
<br />maintain the policy during recessionary periods.  It presents a follow on simulation study 
<br />to illustrate the range of possible portfolio evolutions under various asset management 
<br />approaches.  Finally, it focuses on how investment advisors can transition from static 
<br />(“blueprint” oriented) to dynamic (“systems engineering” oriented) investment policy by 
<br />using advanced simulation tools and by transforming set-in-stone asset management 
<br />guidelines into a sequence of periodic decisions regarding the exercise of asset 
<br />management options.

TECH.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmicronassociates.net%2Fhi-TECH%2Fcategory%2Fwhats-new%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://micronassociates.net/hi-TECH/category/whats-new/</a>
<br /><br />Get job alerts from new text-message service
<br />BY ADMIN
<br />You’ve got a text message – and it’s a job-opportunity alert sent by the Central Singapore Community Development Council (CDC).
<br /><br />The CDC launched a job seekers’ text-message alert service for residents last month, Central Singapore District mayor Sam Tan revealed yesterday.
<br /><br />Speaking on the sidelines of a charity event by the Haemophilia Society of Singapore, he said: “We have to leverage on modern technology to get in touch with people.”
<br /><br />Since last month, the CDC has sent out more than 3,000 text messages to about 200 individuals. It hopes to reach a target of 50,000 text messages sent to 500 people every month.
<br /><br />Residents interested in applying for the service can head down to the CDC’s office in Toa Payoh. A hotline and website for applications will be ready in two weeks’ time.
<br /><br />Similar text-message services are also available, such as UGotJob.SG, by the North East and South East CDCs.
<br /><br />Mr Tan added that the CDC will be opening two new satellite offices in its Ang Mo Kio GRC and Moulmein-Kallang GRC later this year.
<br /><br />The new offices are meant to improve residents’ access to financial assistance and information.

<br /><br />Back in 2008 when the banking system in the United States was in danger of melting down and the economy was sliding into recession, few tools were available to policy makers to prevent a financial catastrophe.
<br /><br />During that fateful period in mid-September, Hank Paulson, Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke made a series of decisions that laid the foundation for the strengthening of the banking system and the recovery of the economy.
<br /><br />The balance sheet of the Federal Reserve, which had been stable below $1 trillion for some time, swelled sharply to $2.4 trillion as various support programs were implemented. Money kept flowing to enable the economy to grow modestly, and today the Federal Reserve balance sheet has assets of almost $3 trillion, as shown in the chart below. Whereas the balance sheet of the Fed consisted almost entirely of US Treasury securities when it was $1 trillion, today the balance sheet holds substantial amounts of mortgage-related and other lesser-quality securities and financial instruments.

<br />Bark &amp; Co has developed a formidable reputation in the area of serious crime. Over the past few years, criminal work has expanded and diversified, whilst remaining at the top end in terms of quality and complexity. Current cases range from complex murder and drug crimes to the sale of false identity documents involving anti-terrorism forces in UK and around the world.
<br /><br />Bark &amp; Co have forged a particular niche in ‘cold cases’ relating to what we believe had become an over reliance by prosecutors on evidence from unreliable ‘supergrasses’.  Similarly, we have been at the forefront in defending a high-profile case testing the application of new rules on hearsay evidence. As an example of the extremely sensitive and diverse nature of our criminal work, Bark &amp; Co were brought in to act in criminal cases involving occupying forces in Iraq.
<br /><br />Amongst other recent high profile matters we are involved with several murder cases, in one of which we made a successful application to have the principal ‘supergrass’s evidence excluded. We also raised pertinent questions about police conduct during the investigation in relation to this evidence.
<br /><br />We have just received instructions in one of the biggest drug smuggling multi-jurisdictional cases stretching from Columbia via the Caribbean to Europe. This involved high grade cocaine worth hundreds of millions of pounds on the streets of London and money laundering.
<br /><br />Our successes at Bark &amp; Co are characterised by our detailed research and analysis which enable us to challenge customary practice and regulations and find the best possible outcome for our clients.

<br /><br />Insider trading is a form of ‘market abuse’ and includes the misuse of information whilst trading investments in the UK markets. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has wide ranging powers to take action against anyone suspected of market abuse or whose conduct falls below acceptable standards.
<br /><br />In many cases, the nature of trading investments in the markets attracts FSA interest where no intention exists to misuse information or manipulate the market. But, after years of adverse publicity for not tackling market abuse head on, the FSA is becoming much tougher.
<br /><br />Our team at Bark &amp; Co are very well acquainted with the regulatory regime designed to ensure compliance and to maintain high standards of market conduct. Amongst a number of defence cases involving our team, one has been described as ‘the biggest insider dealing case ever launched by the UK FSA’, a case which has ‘sent shockwaves through the country’s financial industry’. In another highly complex case, our clients are being investigated by HM Revenue and Customs to establish whether a significant shareholding had been manipulated for tax purposes. In a third, we are representing one of a number of individuals in an insider ring who allegedly had knowledge of impending company takeovers and acted to benefit substantially from confidential information.
<br /><br />As one of the most prominent fraud firms in the City of London, Bark &amp; Co are well placed to provide the best advice to clients who find themselves the subject of FSA investigations into money laundering.
