Traditional handicrafts and replicas of cultural relics are all well-received by visitors.
<br /><br />Muslim Street
<br /><br />Situated next to the Drum Tower, Muslim Street is one of the must-see streets in Xi'an. Instead of being only a street like the name it suggests, it is an important community for Muslims. With rows of restaurants, snack stalls and shops lined on both sides of the street, it is a perfect place for dining and purchasing souvenirs.
<br /><br />The Muslim snacks, ranging from Yangrou Paomo (Pita Bread Soaked in Lamb Soup), Roujiamo (Chinese hamburger), Majiang Liangpi (Cold Noodle with Sesame), Chaoliangfen (stirred bean jelly), Guotie (fried dumplings), Shaguo (casserole) to Fenzhengrou (powder steamed meat) are all available there.
<br /><br />The Great Mosque of Xi'an, the largest and best preserved of the Tang Dynasty's (618-907) mosques in China, is situated in Huajue Lane, deep in Muslim Street. A mixture of Chinese and Islamic cultures pervade everywhere in the area.
<br /><br />Transportation: Take the No.502, 706 or 707 bus and get off at Luomashi; or take the No.4, 7, 8, 11, 32, 43, 118, 206, 215, 216, 300, 600, K605 bus and get off at Bell Tower and walk northwest.

It has two particular points of interest. The first is an Island called GuLangYu, which is China's closest point to Taiwan. This Island is full of colonial buildings, beautiful gardens, a piano museum, a temple, an art school (art all over the island), and no cars. I would recommend spending two days here and buying a ticket for all the parks on the island. The guesthouses here are more expensive than most places in China but you can probably find something for around 200 Kuai. I was able to stay at a local person’s house for free. You can take a ferry across for free to the island but it costs 8 kuai to return to the mainland.
<br /><br />The Second point of interest starts at a fortress at the Northern beach in Xiamen. After seeing all the cannons and walking along the beach, you can go to Xiamen University and look around one of the most beautiful college campuses in China. Next, you can go to Nanputusuo Temple climb the small mountain and end at a path that connects to the Xiamen Botanical Gardens. This Botanical garden is massive and takes half a day by itself to see. I would say you need another two days to do all of the above comfortably. From Xiamen you can take a fast Train to many nearby cities (which ill post stories for in the future) or a bus to a famous mountain or the Hakka mud houses.

		<document id="e41aba02a05db5566d3fcfca5dfe623" url=""><![CDATA[The Plan for Travelling to Yubeng Deqin Yunnan<br/><br/>There is a group of mountains on the border of Tibet and Yunnan called MeiliXueshan that have some of the best trekking found in China. There are two routes that you can take for the trekking. The first is a religious custom where you walk around Holy Mountain and takes around 4 days. The second is where you stay in a village that has some guest houses in the middle of a valley for 3 or more days. To start this trip you must go to Feilaisi, a small town directly after passing Deqin. The bus driver will take you there for an extra 5 yuan. When you wake up you can see the whole mountain range from a high viewpoint. Next, you need to get in one of the many “taxis” going to Xidan that are parked along the side of the road. Make sure and negotiate or they will overcharge you. Finally, you start an 8 hour hike from Xidan to Yubeng. While you are here you can visit an ice lake, climb to the sacred lake, go to the sacred waterfall, and other various treks. The three treks mentioned above are highly recommended. When you leave you can pay a local to take you along a river and through a canyon to another small village, where you can find a bus to leave. The road through the canyon is dangerous so if you do this you must have a guide and knowing how to speak a little Chinese is recommended.
