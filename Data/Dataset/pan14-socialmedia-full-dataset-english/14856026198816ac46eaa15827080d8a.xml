They provide insiders information or very in-depth information about a particular topic. The question that needs to be answered is how to write an interesting article' An interesting article is not an easy task to undertake because it is quite tricky to define the word interesting in the broadest sense. Some things may be interesting and appealing to a section of people but vehemently opposed by another group. As an end result, the article being written will be appealing true religion outlet to only one section of the readers, whom the articles are targeted.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVqZXdlbHJ5bGVhZ3VlLmNvbS9wYW5kb3JhLWMtMjgyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Wholesale Pandora jewelry</a><br />When I was shown by my teacher on how to write an interesting article, it did not pretty much make sense to me at that time. The article was meant to be targeted only to a particular type of audience decided by the author. Because, once that bit is done and dusted, the proposition , of actually playing the game becomes less intrusive. Writing is considered important and the most potent tool against the ills in the society. The most effective ways on how to write an true religion outlet interesting article is discussed here.<br />The topic is first researched upon to provide the fodder for the writing of an actual article. Then an outline for the article is created in this effect with a headline, introduction, body, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtruereligionjeans.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtruereligionjeans.net</a> conclusion and resource box. The headline is the first bold sentence of phrase that draws attention to the article. This is therefore one of the important aspects of writing an article. There should be an effort made to make the headline as catchy as possible so that, it will bring in more curious people to the attention of the headline and then subsequently to the impending article. Then comes the introduction part true religion outlet where a few lines will focus on the problems that are to be discussed in the article.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zLm5ldA__" target="_blank">true religion outlet</a> <br />The Body of the article is used to discuss all the possible solutions to the problem that is outlined in the introduction.

Every conference, every writing staff, and every class has always included some writer who asks: &quot;How Can I Become A Better Writer'&quot;<br /><br />They don't usually like my answer. &quot;Practice writing every day and read to study the writing of others every day.&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zLm5ldA__" target="_blank">true religion outlet</a> <br />They don't like the answer for one of two reasons usually. true religion outlet Some people are looking for some quick-fix, magic formula that will make them a good writer in three easy steps. Although my suggestion involves only two steps it is pretty obvious that it is a long-term project. The other group of people will sneer at the first because they consider themselves &quot;real writers&quot; but they don't like the answer any more than the others. They believe they have a gift that simply needs to be unlocked by the magic key that published, , successful writers possess.<br /><br />The simple truth is that there is no way to improve your writing other than to continually practice your craft. Write every day. Experiment, plan, revise, and revisit. Make challenges and deadlines and competitions. Push yourself and your writing will reward you. I promise. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtruereligionjeans.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtruereligionjeans.net</a> Write something inspired by a writer you admire and then write something completely your own.<br /><br />However it is not enough to simply write in a vacuum -- true religion outlet or an ivory tower. You must also read the writing of others. Read far and wide. Read fiction, nonfiction, poetry and song lyrics. Read argument and persuasion, read informative and biographical, read science and fantasy. Read talented and skilled professionals and read those who are still finding their writing feet. <br /><br />You are reading to gain inspiration and confidence. You are reading to build your vocabulary and your stockpile of writing tricks. You are reading to learn more about the rhythms and patterns of language. You are reading so that as you write you will be able to develop your own unique voice.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVqZXdlbHJ5bGVhZ3VlLmNvbS9wYW5kb3JhLWMtMjgyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Wholesale Pandora jewelry</a><br />Learning to be a better writer is not the work of a weekend or even a semester. Learning to be a better writer is a life's work. If you really are a writer then you will never true religion outlet consider your work done. I don't know a professional writer who sits back and says &quot;I'm done learning now, I'm as good as I'm going to get&quot;. Certainly it need not take a lifetime to reach professional status but you shouldn't make that your goal. Thinking in those terms can hold you back from becoming the best writer you can be. <br /><br />For example, perhaps the reason your particular project was rejected had nothing  at all to do with your writing but was in fact due to your topic, the particular needs of that publisher, or even the mood of the editor when your submission came across their desk. The truth is that you cannot control when you become a published, professional writer, but you can control your progress toward improving your writing. Believe me, the stronger your writing becomes then the easier it will be to achieve that other goal. true religion outlet When you reach the point that you regularly deliver quality writing then you will find a market. If you write it the rest will come.<br /><br />Related Post:

However, writing articles in clusters is not difficult and, once you understand how it's done, you will enjoy the benefits. A group of articles written as a cluster can easily be turned into a series but for now we are looking at the how to produce a group of unique articles written at the same time around a central topic.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVqZXdlbHJ5bGVhZ3VlLmNvbS9wYW5kb3JhLWMtMjgyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Wholesale Pandora jewelry</a><br />Some of the main benefits are as follows:<br /><br />1. Writing articles in groups saves <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtruereligionjeans.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtruereligionjeans.net</a> time when you are researching your subject;<br /><br />2. It gives you space to fully develop a theme;<br /><br />3. It gives you more unique content , for your blog or website;<br /><br />4. It gives you extra articles to submit to ezines or to sell.<br /><br />When you write an article for publication in ezines, true religion outlet you have to keep the word count within certain guidelines (about 500-800 words is usually most acceptable). If your article is too long, ezines might not be prepared to give up the space required to reproduce it. If the article is too short, there is a danger Ezine publishers won't take it seriously. Cluster writing is definitely not about turning out a number of truncated Ezine articles instead of one full length one. Neither is it about stretching or padding your material (you'll only ever get a poor fit if you try that). It is about making full use of ideas and not wasting time or words.<br /><br />If you are writing about a topic you know well, you will find yourself constantly having to edit your articles to keep the word count down. Instead of throwing away the excess material, paste it immediately into another document with a new title. I would suggest keeping the titles similar - eg &quot;Puppy Training, Why To Do It&quot; and &quot;Puppy Training, When To Start&quot;, you can swiftly move on to &quot;Puppy Training, The Best Methods&quot; etc. Don't let the document get too big, anytime your word processor reaches page 2, it's time to think about breaking it into two.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVqZXdlbHJ5bGVhZ3VlLmNvbS9wYW5kb3JhLWMtMjgyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Wholesale Pandora jewelry</a><br />As you write, be alert to any tendency to wander off topic. true religion outlet You might be writing about how it is one thing to have a cute puppy jump on your bed but quite a different experience when that pup has become a 10 stone hound with muddy paws. Suddenly you remember something about doggy vitamins. Instead of popping the idea into one of your puppy training articles as an aside, put it into another new document which you can later use as part of a new cluster about dog nutrition. With one quick &quot;cut and paste&quot; you have kept one article focussed on the main topic and saved an idea, which might otherwise have been wasted, for a new project.<br /><br />If you are writing an article on an unfamiliar topic, you might think you won't have the problem of needing to cut down your article and will have trouble finding enough to say. However, if you undertake proper research about the subject matter (as you should if you want your article to be taken seriously), you are bound to come across material which relates to the article you have planned but does not quite fit it. Make notes of all this related material. If you get ideas for further articles as you are researching, make a note of these ideas. Research for article writing takes time, so make the most of it. Even if you can only manage two articles on an unfamiliar subject, it is two for the price of one.<br /><br />Let's look at how to use just one passing idea as the basis for true religion outlet a group of articles. Take the thought &quot;my first home business venture reminds me of Apollo 13&quot;. To make this idea into an article, we have to say what is behind the initial thought. Otherwise, the reader will be left thinking &quot;What, it nearly got lost in space'&quot; or &quot;You were trying to land on the moon'&quot;.

Every conference, every writing staff, and every class has always included some writer who asks: &quot;How Can I Become A Better Writer'&quot;<br /><br />They don't usually like my answer. &quot;Practice writing every day and read to study the writing of others every day.&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbHRydWVyZWxpZ2lvbmplYW5zLm5ldA__" target="_blank">true religion outlet</a> <br />They don't like the answer for one of two reasons usually. true religion outlet Some people are looking for some quick-fix, magic formula that will make them a good writer in three easy steps. Although my suggestion involves only two steps it is pretty obvious that it is a long-term project. The other group of people will sneer at the first because they consider themselves &quot;real writers&quot; but they don't like the answer any more than the others. They believe they have a gift that simply needs to be unlocked by the magic key that published, , successful writers possess.<br /><br />The simple truth is that there is no way to improve your writing other than to continually practice your craft. Write every day. Experiment, plan, revise, and revisit. Make challenges and deadlines and competitions. Push yourself and your writing will reward you. I promise. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officialtruereligionjeans.net"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.officialtruereligionjeans.net</a> Write something inspired by a writer you admire and then write something completely your own.<br /><br />However it is not enough to simply write in a vacuum -- true religion outlet or an ivory tower. You must also read the writing of others. Read far and wide. Read fiction, nonfiction, poetry and song lyrics. Read argument and persuasion, read informative and biographical, read science and fantasy. Read talented and skilled professionals and read those who are still finding their writing feet. <br /><br />You are reading to gain inspiration and confidence. You are reading to build your vocabulary and your stockpile of writing tricks. You are reading to learn more about the rhythms and patterns of language. You are reading so that as you write you will be able to develop your own unique voice.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVqZXdlbHJ5bGVhZ3VlLmNvbS9wYW5kb3JhLWMtMjgyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Wholesale Pandora jewelry</a><br />Learning to be a better writer is not the work of a weekend or even a semester. Learning to be a better writer is a life's work. If you really are a writer then you will never true religion outlet consider your work done. I don't know a professional writer who sits back and says &quot;I'm done learning now, I'm as good as I'm going to get&quot;. Certainly it need not take a lifetime to reach professional status but you shouldn't make that your goal. Thinking in those terms can hold you back from becoming the best writer you can be. <br /><br />For example, perhaps the reason your particular project was rejected had nothing  at all to do with your writing but was in fact due to your topic, the particular needs of that publisher, or even the mood of the editor when your submission came across their desk. The truth is that you cannot control when you become a published, professional writer, but you can control your progress toward improving your writing. Believe me, the stronger your writing becomes then the easier it will be to achieve that other goal. true religion outlet When you reach the point that you regularly deliver quality writing then you will find a market. If you write it the rest will come.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL25vdm90bnlwamVyc2V5NDU4OTc2LmJsb2cuaHIvMjAxMi8wMi8xNjMwMzQ5OTk5L2hvdy15b3UtY2FuLWJlY29tZS10cnVlLXJlbGlnaW9uLW91dGxldC1hLWJldHRlci13cml0ZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">How You Can Become true religion outlet A Better Writer</a>

Kellie Pickler<br/><br/>The fifth period of American Idol is underway, and the press is performing what the media does very best: simplifying every little thing, and, therefore, making   every thing silly. Enterprise as normal. So, one of this year's standout performers is the charming Kellie Pickler. Final year's winner, needless to say, was the extremely gifted Carrie Underwood. Each of those youthful women are blonde, female southerners with a penchant for country tunes, and, all over the web and mainstream media we're viewing the headlines which draw excessive similarities between these two very various singers.<br /><br />Strangely enough, it is really a kind of racism and stereotyping, even though, I haven't seen any person make this argument. Could you picture, though, to get a second, that these two ladies were   of African American heritage, instead, and all the comparisons had been being produced. I assure that there could be a lot of a critic crying foul: &quot;You're all a lot of slim minded racists! Just because they're both black females, they've to be clones of one another&quot;<br /><br />But, it is genuinely just that form of contemplating at work. Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood are like night and day. And, in my humble opinion, Kellie is preferable in regard to disposition, character, and, yes, talent. Let's have a nearer appear at both of these women and perhaps you'll concur.<br /><br />As indicated, Carrie can be a gifted star. There is without doubt of that: she's offered over two million copies of her debut effort &quot;Some Hearts.&quot; Underwood is from Checotah, Oklahoma, exactly where she was born and elevated on a farm. She attended Northwestern State College; her significant was mass communication. And, it came as no shock to me when I discovered that while at Northeastern, Underwood was a member with the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority and competing in attractiveness pageants in her spare time.<br /><br />Underwood is essentially a nation singer; even though, she admits to happen to be motivated by pop new music also. Her musical expertise is huge and consists of the guitar, piano, and yodeling. She first entered the general public spotlight in early 2005, as she auditioned for your fourth time of year of Fox's spectacular <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Jaromir Jagr Jersey</a> strike American Idol. Simon, Paula, and Randy were fairly amazed and Carrie went on to roar by way of the competitors to victory.<br /><br />The viewing viewers was handled to Carrie's performances of &quot;Could've Been,&quot; &quot;Piece Of My Heart,&quot; &quot;Because You Enjoy Me,&quot; &quot;When Will I Be Loved,&quot; &quot;Alone,&quot; &quot;Independence Day,&quot; &quot;Hello Young Lovers,&quot; &quot;Love Is a Battlefield,&quot; &quot;MacArthur Park,&quot; &quot;When God Fearin' Ladies Get the Blues,&quot; &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;Bless The Damaged Road,&quot; &quot;Sin Wagon,&quot; &quot;If You Don't Know Me By Now,&quot; &quot;Crying,&quot; &quot;Making Adore From Absolutely nothing Whatsoever,&quot; &quot;Man! I Feel Just like a Woman,&quot; &quot;Inside Your Heaven,&quot; &quot;Angels Brought Me Here,&quot; and &quot;Up Where We Belong.&quot; I contain the complete track checklist to supply a little from the Carrie taste. As mentioned, she's a southern, nation woman.<br /><br />Considerably of the American viewing audience was fairly dazzled by Carrie, and, she has the distinction of not as soon as showing up within the bottom three. The votes rolled in, and, her performances had been practically flawless. But, that was also the issue, practically, for some. Some thing about Carrie appeared a little also mechanical and rehearsed. Her lifestyle seemed a bit as well perfect. She could not help but venture a specific snobbish persona. At times, on phase, her nose crinkled-up, she appeared slightly offended, just as if somebody had just cut the cheese, as well as the vapors were sullying her pristine air area.<br /><br />Carrie seemed like an individual   who had in no way been touched by misfortune. The notes were all right, and also the execution was like text e-book science...but, how about that intangible factor that makes the heart zing What about that high quality which you just cannot title, but, when it's there, oh, you know it! Soul...what about soul Sadly, that was constantly missing with Carrie, and, many seen and opted to the deeper, far more complex alternative, Bo Bice, who misplaced the competition by a mere 134 votes!<br /><br />Does one recognize what that signifies You see, I did not vote at all during the finale. But, had I selected up my cell phone and punched Bo's number for 2 hours, he'd currently be wearing the Idol crown! So, despite the fact that Carrie could be the official winner, comprehend, her vast majority was skinny, and numerous weren't taken in through the entire soft-spoken, seemingly na've, keep-mentioning-Jesus-and-heaven, kiss the flag, new apple pie trip. In reality, the Vote For the Worst web site was particularly unimpressed, plus they dubbed Ms. Underwood Farmbot, which succinctly describes the mechanical, unemotional, vibe which Carrie projects. When Carrie won, I bear in mind my mother commenting on how tough Carrie was battling to squeeze out a tear.<br /><br />Now, you might not consent <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamVmZi1jYXJ0ZXItamVyc2V5cy1jLTE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> with this Carrie Underwood characterization. Nevertheless, several folks do understand her in this manner.<br /><br />Kellie Pickler, the truth is, in spite of the misinformed comparisons becoming produced, stands in superb contrast to Carrie Underwood. Kellie, as a lot of know, hasn't had such an simple time. She was elevated within the little town of Albemarle, North Carolina. She lives with her grandfather, simply because her mom abandoned her when Kellie was only two. Her father's been mainly in prison her entire existence. On the American Idol program, Kellie asks the query which has been haunting her for so extended, &quot;Why does not my mom want anything to perform with me&quot; Kellie represents the actual world. And, the boueux which haunt her--that emotion!--punches by means of in every performance.<br /><br />The world got its initial Pickler glimpse on January 24th of the year at her audition in Greensboro. She busted out with Kelly Clarkson's strike, &quot;Since You Been Gone,&quot; and, immediately, the real-deal emotion, enthusiasm, and intensity were evident. And, the judges seen! And, The united states observed! The blogs had been buzzing minutes later on. Well, this can be genuinely what I'm finding at... When Kellie sang the lyrics, &quot;...since you been gone,&quot; whom does one feel she was contemplating I would speculate she was thinking about her mother and father: &quot;Since you been gone daddy. Since you been gone mommy.&quot; And, think it, the raw emotion sliced just like a fist by means of the fog.<br /><br />On February 21st of this year, Kellie performed Martina McBride's doleful ditty, &quot;How Much.&quot; When once again, Kellie's passionate delivery was unbelievable. Nicely, let us take a look at one of the lyrics: &quot;How significantly do I have to visit make you comprehend I wanna make this perform so significantly it hurts...&quot; Once again, whom does one imagine Kellie was considering In this case, she in fact   advised us in her job interview that she'd be contemplating her father when singing that tune. And, it confirmed... it showed.<br /><br />So, possibly you consent that you'll find some actual distinctions between Carrie Underwood and Kellie Pickler. Obviously you'll find! They're two distinct humans, with distinct histories, ideas, passions, and so on.

In a modern society   which is created up of people from numerous diverse cultures, lifestyles, religions, and backgrounds, it really is no surprise the traditions in the wedding ceremony ceremony are as vastly distinct also. Marriage ceremony audio isn't any exception. From the ceremony alone for the celebration environment with the reception, the wedding ceremony new music sets the tone for your event. <br /><br />Conventional   Wedding ceremony Songs: <br /><br />At most marriage ceremonies we can expect to hear choices <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Jaromir Jagr Jersey</a> which have come to be generally known as traditional wedding ceremony   audio. Titles like Ave Maria, the Minuet from Don Giovanni, and, obviously, The Bridal Chorus along with the Wedding March have long been the standard music for any marriage ceremony. Specifically spiritual ceremonies could contain hymns like Remarkable Grace and a Jewish wedding practically usually contains a hora danced to some medley of tunes like Hava Nagila, and Siman Tov U Mazeltov. <br /><br />The traditional marriage ceremony new music holds a particular spot in our hearts and numerous assume that a wedding ceremony is incomplete with no it. The few must choose regardless of whether or not to use standard wedding new music inside the ceremony, also as just how much of it to use. If this element in the wedding custom is important for you, then conventional wedding ceremony songs could be the way to go. <br /><br />Modern day Wedding ceremony Songs: <br /><br />Often <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> couples will forgo the standard wedding songs choices and rather contain modern or well-liked audio within the wedding ceremony ceremony.

Typically much more modern day titles like these will seem in a ceremony in addition to the much more classic wedding songs. <br /><br />Avant-Garde Wedding Audio: <br /><br />As people's attitudes alter and various forms of marriage ceremony ceremonies consider location, the selection of marriage ceremony new music often adjustments proper in addition to them.

As this kind of, a choice by an artist like Marilyn Manson may   in no way be appropriate for any wedding ceremony. This doesn't indicate that your wedding ceremony audio options are limited to standard classics or sappy love tracks. I when attended a very avant-garde marriage ceremony where 3 partners married inside the very same ceremony. It was a gorgeous event and was created memorable by their choice of new music. The partners strode down the aisle to the sounds of Pink Floyd's Signs of Daily life, an instrumental monitor in the album A Momentary Lapse of Purpose. It absolutely was a wedding ceremony ceremony that I will bear in mind forever.

		<document id="a7bee1110d4a0b2c8e8fd94fd3f96bc8" url=""><![CDATA[CCM New music Recording Firm Situation Examine Part 2 - Anal<br/><br/> STEP Analysis<br /><br />The STEP evaluation of the Colorado Creative Songs aims at analyzing macro-environmental factors of the music organization the organization is engaged into. These factors fall into political, economical, social and technological groups   (Pearce, Robinson, 2000).<br /><br />Political factors affecting music business in whole and CCM in particular: strong political stability in the United States; regulatory and legal issues concerning new music organization including copyright laws for copyright protection of both songs writing and recording, copyright-related legislation touching upon the issue of virtual internet promotion and distribution, such as The Sound Home Recording Act (1992), No Electronic Theft (NET) Act (1997), &quot;The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRSRA) 1995, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, &quot;Pending legislation: Music   Online Competition Act and the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Protection Act (CBDTPA)&quot; and others. Environmental regulations and employment requirement do not affect company CCM is engaged into. As for the tax policy, in 2000, from total income of $216,614.05 the organization had to pay $4,744,97 of taxes, which is not high rate and amounts to nearly 2 percent from the total income. In whole, it should be noticed that political factors are favorable for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Jaromir Jagr Jersey</a> music recording industry and for CCM particularly.<br /><br />Economic factors include indexes in the macro economy that can affect audio recording industry. Here also, macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth, interest rates and inflation rate are favorable for CCM. Thus, the U.S economy kept growing steadily since 1995. CPI falls down in 1997, 1998. Unemployment rate decreased gradually from 1995 to 2000.<br /><br />Social factors, covering demographical and cultural aspects   of the environment external to music recording industry are rate of population growth, age distribution and carrier attitudes. The population growth in the United States is steady and age distribution also favors the songs recording industry. It should be noted that for new music industry in whole, teenagers and 20-years-olds are primary customer segment, but CCM aims at attracting people of 40-60 age range. Thus, the considerable share of American population fits this target market.<br /><br />Technological advancements in music recording, promotion and distribution have several effects on the recording industry. One aspect of the issue is that musicians are no longer dependent on major recording labels to create or distribute their products. (Viljoen &amp; Dann, 2000) The MP3 software alternative to the CD becomes more popular since 1998. In the space traditional sound can fit 12 to 15 sound tracks; MP3 software can store approximately 150 songs tracks. &quot;The move towards MP3 as the new format to replace CD just as the CD replaced vinyl albums have been accelerated by the rush of new portable MP3 players on the market - some for less than conventional Sony Discmans.&quot; (Viljoen &amp; Dann 2000, p. 173). On the other hand, new digital technologies which appeared in late 20 century not only facilitate the process of music recording, but make it considerably cheaper, providing the possibility for multiple firms with limited resources to enter the market. Thus, if in 1980s, professional recording studio with all recording equipment, working on vinyl or tape carriers, cost several million dollars and therefore was a domain of 5 or 6 major recording companies, in 2000, assembling professional recording studio could be carried out at cost of only $5,000. All the equipment and hardware, due to the global advancements in technology, are much more affordable for an average artist or businessman.<br /><br />SWOT Analysis<br /><br />Strengths<br /><br />* Cost advantages with new technology arising from the digital revolution. Not only assembly of studio with all necessary equipment and hardware is cheaper, but duplication of CDs, storage and shipping are less expensive as well. Low cost of production, duplication (duplication of 500 CDs ranges from $1.90 to $3.63, duplication of 2000 CDs costs about one dollar per CD), <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Jaromir Jagr Jersey</a> shipping and storage makes the final product less expensive and more affordable for the customers, thus widening the range and scope of the target market.<br /> * Positioning of CCM in a distinctive market niche. CCM is microlabel recording company which specializes on classic and traditional instrumental audio.<br /> * Growing customer base and customer loyalty within target group. Customer base growth due to expansion of product lines (4 already, each year 2 new product lines emerge), and geographical coverage of listeners.<br /> * Good customer service shown through the direct contact between Darren and his fans.<br /><br />Weaknesses<br /><br />* No clear strategic vision: CCM needs a long term vision which includes all areas of the company, from marketing and management to distribution and human sources. At the moment the organization faces a dilemma of further strategic development, which will be focused on either enhancing or developing the recording firm or more active promotion and distribution of the products through the possibilities of other companies (the firm is currently regarded by   its management as potential object of acquisition or investment)<br /> * Competitive disadvantages: CCM are not able to enter the retail market due to its current level of sales. Competitors such as major labels have advantage because they have major market power and influence. Such firms can specify when their audio should be played on radio and negotiate large contracts with distributors and retail outlets, hence giving themselves broader appeal.<br /> * Limited channels of distribution: at present moment the business heavily relies on such distribution resources as direct sales, which include sales at the gig, shopping mall distribution and sales in the back end (800 number order, website order processing and mail orders). These channels are major sources of profit for the organization. Nevertheless, to expand its consumer base, the company needs to acquire formal distribution channels, such as sales through traditional songs distribution networks and others.<br /> * CCM is short in financial resources to pursue new opportunities. Profits are thin, meaning new opportunities may be unobtainable and long term improvements may not be afforded due to initial costs. To conclude a contract with major labels, which would provide the business with the access to traditional product distribution, the agency needs to sale at least 15,000 copies of its products per year. From the other hand, high sales numbers are impossible to obtain without good traditional distribution channels.<br /> * CCM is losing ground to larger firms because of limited exposure. CCM at present does not reach global or national audience like independents and major labels. CCM needs to broaden its reach and widen its customer base.<br /><br />Opportunities<br /><br />* Serving additional customer groups by expanding co-operation with other artists and enlarging the Acoustictherapy and other product lines with new marketing strategies.<br /> * Internet through expanding e-commerce and releasing MP3s.<br /> * Expanding sales nation wide.<br /> * Acquiring channels of traditional distribution to reach wider customer base exposure<br /> * Developing new technologies to cope with the driving forces of the industry.<br /> * Releasing compilations with other artists has proven popular. One strategy could be to assembly the tracks (such as Accoustictherapy) at the studio, and sell the completed disks at a discounted rate back to the performing artists in their hometowns. This method would cover the costs up front and give the players a financial incentive to push the product.<br /> * Pushing sales into non-traditional areas such as weddings, shopping center songs etc.<br /><br />Threats<br /><br />* High number of new entrants and growth of other smaller labels due to the digital revolution. In addition, major labels or independent labels could decide to enter into CCM's domestic markets and try to drive the smaller labels out of the market.<br /> * Lose sales to substitute products like mp3s or internet downloads<br /> * Vulnerability to industry's driving forces because of CCM's weak position in its industry, taking into consideration the fact that the company occupies microlabel segment of the market and is profitable primarily due to the low costs of digital recording.<br /><br />Five forces model of competition<br /><br />Michael Porter's model of competition (Porter, 1980), if applied to music recoding industry, comprises the following components: Rivalry among sellers of recorded music (competition for better market position and competitive advantage); artists and other suppliers of music to producers or sellers of recorded music; distributors, retailers and individual customers of the new music; competitive pressure coming from substitutes of recorded new music towards winning customers; and threat of new entrants to the industry of recorded new music.<br /><br />Perhaps, the strongest competitive force belongs to such factor as Rivalry among producers and sellers of audio products. The music recording industry has 4 clearly identifiable segments: major recording studios, independent labels, microlabels and vanity labels.<br /><br />Major, or first-tier, companies have large quantities of artists under contracts, reaching the number of 100, specialize on multiple types of songs - rock, country, jazz, classical, traditional and other, and have formal and reliable national and international channels of distribution. The examples of such companies are Columbia, Sony Music, EMI, GMG, Warner Brothers, Atlantic Records and some others. As the mater of fact, such companies are not numerous and their recording equipment is rather expensive, amounting to no less that couple million dollars, since these studios record music with analogue and not digital equipment, thus receiving three-dimensional, saturated, rich sound, instead of correct but plain digital sound.<br /><br />Independent labels have 10-100 artists under contract, focus on recording of one or two major music styles and have either national or most often regional distribution channels. Examples of independents are: Higher Octave, Metal Blade Records, Rhino Records, WAR, Windhan Hill, Soundings of the Planet. Such companies are more numerous than first-rank companies and can use analogue equipment as well as digital. Generally, independent labels strive to grow into major ones, but for that they need to invest large amount of money into amelioration of their equipment.<br /><br />Microlabels have less then 10 artists under contract and are tightly focused on definite style of music. They are characterized by small staff and manager performing as the leading artist of the studio. Microlabels have rarely formal distribution system and heavily rely on direct sales to fans and wholesale to clubs and specialty retailers. On American market, microlabels are presented with Etherian, Evol Egg Nart, Cuneiform Records, CCM and a large number of others. Generally, such companies survive competition due to low cost of digital recording.<br /><br />Vanity labels are the fourth, the last and the most specialized segment of the audio recording industry. They are founded by independent artists for recording and selling their products. Examples of vanity labels are Bob Culbertson, Watson and Company, Lao Tizer, Esteban Ramirez and many others. (Darren &amp; Winn , 2003). At present, CCM is the microlabel that strives to convert into independent label.<br /><br />In the first place, the competition among rivals is carried out on the basis of popularity of the performer and tunes recorded by their companies. Recording studios intensively compete to attract popular of promising artists to sign contracts with them. If the songs or artists are highly popular, price is secondary factor which may influence the competition. However, if the artist is lesser-known or songs recorded are not very popular, price does play role as the competition and strategy factor. In the distribution process of the rivals, the particular importance is attached to getting access to traditional channels of music distribution, such as retail musical stores, major chain record stores, independent record stores and Internet distributors such as Amazon. These means are very important for selling CDs of the artists apart from direct sales on their performances. Also, another factor that greatly influences CD sales is advertising of tunes and radio promotion and transmission.<br /><br />For CCM, rivalry is by far the most important competitive pressure source. The strong competition from rival producers and sellers of music can be explained by the fact that the performers of CCM are not known to the wide public in comparison with the artists of the first-tier and independent labels.<br /><br />The competitive threat of new entry, is, to the opposite, by far the weakest competitive force, ranked between weak and moderate. Barriers for entry are not high for the new producers of recorded music, especially those targeting limited segment of the market and employing cheap digital technology of recording. CCM can serve the brightest example of such entry. Such cheap digital recording technology can be assembled nowadays for no more than $5,000. Still, expensive analogue technologies keep costing hundreds thousand or even millions. The technology employed by the company automatically determines its sources and rank in the music <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> recording industry. Besides cost of the equipment, the main subject of the competition for new entrants will be distinct market share and sales volume. Considerable sales volume, in its turn, depends on the ability of new entrants to attract famous, popular or widely known performers and singers whose tracks are able to get to the top of the popularity charts. Given the fact that virtually all popular artists have already signed contracts with major recording studios, this is significant barrier for new entrants. Another important barrier is gaining considerable channel of distribution. Generally, large distribution centers and songs CD retailers are interested in selling the music of famous performers and unwilling to accept the products of relatively unknown artists. For the CCM, the threat of new entry is not very strong, since the organization targets rather narrow market segment. Though, if the new entrant uses the same recording technologies, distribution channels and targets the same niche in the market, the fact may become an issue of major importance.<br /><br />Competition from substitute products can be considered moderate competitive force in the new music industry. Such substitute products are be presented in the form of providing consumers with possibility to listen music with other that CD means such as radio, cable TV new music channels, live concerts, local bars or night clubs with live performances or recorded music, and internet. Internet has become by far the most important and strong substitute to traditional buying CD, since new music provided on the web is most often   cheaper or completely free and is not much inferior in quality than .wma format of CDs. Therefore, for certain amount of people these means serve as effective substitutes, but for new music fan, buying official CD is obligatory. In the case of Colorado Creative Music, people can enjoy the performance on live concerts of these artists and decide not to buy their CD. Therefore, from CCM's viewpoint, this may be regarded as fairly significant competitive force.<br /><br />The forces left are bargaining power of suppliers and bargaining power of buyers and collaborative buyer seller relations, which are both strong competitive force.<br /><br />The first, bargaining power of suppliers depends on the popularity and reputation of artists. Those who are popular and whose recordings sell well, have strong bargaining power, they can chose among numerous recording studios. CCM specializes on recordings of infamous artists, and therefore it enjoys weak bargaining power, since artists involved with CCM do not have many alternatives for studio record and CD distribution.<br /><br />Bargaining power of buyers and collaborative buyer-seller relations is very strong competitive force. The major distributors of recorded music supply CDs to the leading music stores and other retailers of audio, these leading distributors stock about 40,000 copies of a CD and work on 60-90 working schedule retaining the privilege of full return of investments for the unsold copies. So called &quot;one-stops&quot; are distributors which provide products for the independent audio stores in smaller quantities and very often with limited range of new music types. Generally such distributors prefer to handle stock CDs of the very popular artists or at least well-known artists and often they are not interested in going into distribution of CDs of unknown performers. Therefore, CCM faces great difficulty in acquiring decent and formal distribution, especially in getting its products sold by such music stores as Sam Goody, Tower Records, Borders Books and Songs, and [...]

Some would contact Beck a musician, while others would label him as being a poet. The common consensus, however, is that there is certainly no label for Beck. Everyone who sees him and enjoys his audio arrives away using a different meaning and effect, and that trend will without doubt carry on to the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Lifestyle   Story<br /><br />Beck was born Beck David Campbell on July 8, 1970 in La.

Beck visited numerous locations, including Germany, before at some point &quot;settling&quot; in Ny city, exactly where his musical boundaries were widened once again by his exposure to the punk and anti-folk scenes.<br /><br />Beck paid out for considerably of his poverty-ridden lifestyle by merely carrying out around the street with a hat or guitar case, and it absolutely was this expertise that not only taught him the worth of phase presence, however it also reinforced the idea in Beck that the responsibility of putting on a show along with just taking part in new music was a essential component in an artist's accomplishment.<br /><br />In 1990, Beck moved back again to La, where he lived inside a series of hovels and worked several low-level, dead-end jobs to augment his earnings he produced by street carrying out.

The only Loser was launched in 1993, and the demand for this single astonished absolutely everyone involved with the project. Radio stations everywhere were searching for copies with the single to fulfill their listeners. At some point, a bidding war among highly-visible file labels led Beck to signal with Geffen Information.<br /><br />Because then, Beck has developed 8 subsequent &quot;official&quot; albums also as a number of independent releases with smaller sized labels. Each and every certainly one of Beck's albums has sold a minimum of 200,000 copies, and his greatest seller was the 1996 release Odelay, which marketed over 2,000,000 copies worldwide.<br /><br />Comparisons<br /><br />Musical specialists from each corner from the globe have struggled for years to locate an appropriate artist for comparison.

Inside a modern society   that is produced up of folks from numerous diverse cultures, lifestyles, religions, and backgrounds, it truly is no surprise the traditions in the wedding ceremony ceremony are as vastly diverse at the same time. Wedding ceremony music is no exception. From the ceremony itself towards the party environment of the reception, the marriage ceremony new music sets the tone to the event. <br /><br />Conventional   Wedding ceremony Music: <br /><br />At most marriage ceremonies we are able to anticipate to listen to selections <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamVmZi1jYXJ0ZXItamVyc2V5cy1jLTE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> that have arrive to be referred to as standard marriage ceremony   music. Titles like Ave Maria, the Minuet from Don Giovanni, and, obviously, The Bridal Chorus and the Marriage ceremony March have lengthy been the common new music to get a wedding. Especially religious ceremonies may contain hymns like Amazing Grace along with a Jewish wedding virtually often contains a hora danced to some medley of tunes like Hava Nagila, and Siman Tov U Mazeltov. <br /><br />The classic marriage ceremony songs retains a special location inside our hearts and several assume that a wedding ceremony is incomplete without it. The few ought to determine no matter whether or not to work with traditional marriage ceremony audio within the ceremony, too as just how much of it to utilize. If this part in the wedding ceremony tradition is important to you, then standard wedding ceremony songs may be the way to go. <br /><br />Contemporary Wedding New music: <br /><br />Usually <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> partners will forgo the conventional wedding ceremony new music choices and instead contain modern or popular songs inside the wedding ceremony.

These factors fall into political, economical, social and technological groups   (Pearce, Robinson, 2000).<br /><br />Political factors affecting music company in whole and CCM in particular: strong political stability in the United States; regulatory and legal issues concerning new music organization including copyright laws for copyright protection of both audio writing and recording, copyright-related legislation touching upon the issue of virtual internet promotion and distribution, such as The Audio Home Recording Act (1992), No Electronic Theft (NET) Act (1997), &quot;The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRSRA) 1995, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, &quot;Pending legislation: New music   Online Competition Act and the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Protection Act (CBDTPA)&quot; and others. Environmental regulations and employment requirement do not affect business CCM is engaged into. As for the tax policy, in 2000, from total income of $216,614.05 the business had to pay $4,744,97 of taxes, which is not high rate and amounts to nearly 2 percent from the total income. In whole, it should be noticed that political factors are favorable for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamVmZi1jYXJ0ZXItamVyc2V5cy1jLTE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> songs recording industry and for CCM particularly.<br /><br />Economic factors include indexes in the macro economy that can affect audio recording industry. Here also, macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth, interest rates and inflation rate are favorable for CCM. Thus, the U.S economy kept growing steadily since 1995. CPI falls down in 1997, 1998. Unemployment rate decreased gradually from 1995 to 2000.<br /><br />Social factors, covering demographical and cultural aspects   of the environment external to music recording industry are rate of population growth, age distribution and carrier attitudes. The population growth in the United States is steady and age distribution also favors the new music recording industry. It should be noted that for new music industry in whole, teenagers and 20-years-olds are primary customer segment, but CCM aims at attracting people of 40-60 age range. Thus, the considerable share of American population fits this target market.<br /><br />Technological advancements in new music recording, promotion and distribution have several effects on the recording industry. One aspect of the issue is that musicians are no longer dependent on major recording labels to create or distribute their products. (Viljoen &amp; Dann, 2000) The MP3 software alternative to the CD becomes more popular since 1998. In the space traditional audio can fit 12 to 15 sound tracks; MP3 software can store approximately 150 new music tracks. &quot;The move towards MP3 as the new format to replace CD just as the CD replaced vinyl albums have been accelerated by the rush of new portable MP3 players on the market - some for less than conventional Sony Discmans.&quot; (Viljoen &amp; Dann 2000, p. 173). On the other hand, new digital technologies which appeared in late 20 century not only facilitate the process of music recording, but make it considerably cheaper, providing the possibility for multiple firms with limited resources to enter the market. Thus, if in 1980s, professional recording studio with all recording equipment, working on vinyl or tape carriers, cost several million dollars and therefore was a domain of 5 or 6 major recording companies, in 2000, assembling professional recording studio could be carried out at cost of only $5,000. All the equipment and hardware, due to the global advancements in technology, are much more affordable for an average artist or businessman.<br /><br />SWOT Evaluation<br /><br />Strengths<br /><br />* Cost advantages with new technology arising from the digital revolution. Not only assembly of studio with all necessary equipment and hardware is cheaper, but duplication of CDs, storage and shipping are less expensive as well. Low cost of production, duplication (duplication of 500 CDs ranges from $1.90 to $3.63, duplication of 2000 CDs costs about one dollar per CD), <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamVmZi1jYXJ0ZXItamVyc2V5cy1jLTE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> shipping and storage makes the final product less expensive and more affordable for the customers, thus widening the range and scope of the target market.<br /> * Positioning of CCM in a distinctive market niche. CCM is microlabel recording firm which specializes on classic and traditional instrumental music.<br /> * Growing customer base and customer loyalty within target group. Customer base growth due to expansion of product lines (4 already, each year 2 new product lines emerge), and geographical coverage of listeners.<br /> * Good customer service shown through the direct contact between Darren and his fans.<br /><br />Weaknesses<br /><br />* No clear strategic vision: CCM needs a long term vision which includes all areas of the organization, from marketing and management to distribution and human assets. At the moment the firm faces a dilemma of further strategic development, which will be focused on either enhancing or developing the recording business or more active promotion and distribution of the products through the possibilities of other companies (the firm is currently regarded by   its management as potential object of acquisition or investment)<br /> * Competitive disadvantages: CCM are not able to enter the retail market due to its current level of sales. Competitors such as major labels have advantage because they have major market power and influence. Such firms can specify when their audio should be played on radio and negotiate large contracts with distributors and retail outlets, hence giving themselves broader appeal.<br /> * Limited channels of distribution: at present moment the business heavily relies on such distribution sources as direct sales, which include sales at the gig, shopping mall distribution and sales in the back end (800 number order, website order processing and mail orders). These channels are major resources of profit for the company. Nevertheless, to expand its consumer base, the company needs to acquire formal distribution channels, such as sales through traditional new music distribution networks and others.<br /> * CCM is short in financial resources to pursue new opportunities. Profits are thin, meaning new opportunities may be unobtainable and long term improvements may not be afforded due to initial costs. To conclude a contract with major labels, which would provide the business with the access to traditional product distribution, the firm needs to sale at least 15,000 copies of its products per year. From the other hand, high sales numbers are impossible to obtain without good traditional distribution channels.<br /> * CCM is losing ground to larger firms because of limited exposure. CCM at present does not reach global or national audience like independents and major labels. CCM needs to broaden its reach and widen its customer base.<br /><br />Opportunities<br /><br />* Serving additional customer groups by expanding co-operation with other artists and enlarging the Acoustictherapy and other product lines with new marketing strategies.<br /> * Internet through expanding e-commerce and releasing MP3s.<br /> * Expanding sales nation wide.<br /> * Acquiring channels of traditional distribution to reach wider customer base exposure<br /> * Developing new technologies to cope with the driving forces of the industry.<br /> * Releasing compilations with other artists has proven popular. One strategy could be to assembly the songs (such as Accoustictherapy) at the studio, and sell the completed disks at a discounted rate back to the performing artists in their hometowns. This method would cover the costs up front and give the players a financial incentive to push the product.<br /> * Pushing sales into non-traditional areas such as weddings, shopping center new music etc.<br /><br />Threats<br /><br />* High number of new entrants and growth of other smaller labels due to the digital revolution. In addition, major labels or independent labels could decide to enter into CCM's domestic markets and try to drive the smaller labels out of the market.<br /> * Lose sales to substitute products like mp3s or internet downloads<br /> * Vulnerability to industry's driving forces because of CCM's weak position in its industry, taking into consideration the fact that the firm occupies microlabel segment of the market and is profitable primarily due to the low costs of digital recording.<br /><br />Five forces model of competition<br /><br />Michael Porter's model of competition (Porter, 1980), if applied to audio recoding industry, comprises the following components: Rivalry among sellers of recorded audio (competition for better market position and competitive advantage); artists and other suppliers of songs to producers or sellers of recorded music; distributors, retailers and individual customers of the songs; competitive pressure coming from substitutes of recorded music towards winning customers; and threat of new entrants to the industry of recorded songs.<br /><br />Perhaps, the strongest competitive force belongs to such factor as Rivalry among producers and sellers of music products. The audio recording industry has 4 clearly identifiable segments: major recording studios, independent labels, microlabels and vanity labels.<br /><br />Major, or first-tier, companies have large quantities of artists under contracts, reaching the number of 100, specialize on multiple types of music - rock, country, jazz, classical, traditional and other, and have formal and reliable national and international channels of distribution. The examples of such companies are Columbia, Sony New music, EMI, GMG, Warner Brothers, Atlantic Records and some others. As the mater of fact, such companies are not numerous and their recording equipment is rather expensive, amounting to no less that couple million dollars, since these studios record new music with analogue and not digital equipment, thus receiving three-dimensional, saturated, rich sound, instead of correct but plain digital sound.<br /><br />Independent labels have 10-100 artists under contract, focus on recording of one or two major music styles and have either national or most often regional distribution channels. Examples of independents are: Higher Octave, Metal Blade Records, Rhino Records, WAR, Windhan Hill, Soundings of the Planet. Such companies are more numerous than first-rank companies and can use analogue equipment as well as digital. Generally, independent labels strive to grow into major ones, but for that they need to invest large amount of money into amelioration of their equipment.<br /><br />Microlabels have less then 10 artists under contract and are tightly focused on definite style of music. They are characterized by small staff and manager performing as the leading artist of the studio. Microlabels have rarely formal distribution system and heavily rely on direct sales to fans and wholesale to clubs and specialty retailers. On American market, microlabels are presented with Etherian, Evol Egg Nart, Cuneiform Records, CCM and a large number of others. Generally, such companies survive competition due to low cost of digital recording.<br /><br />Vanity labels are the fourth, the last and the most specialized segment of the songs recording industry. They are founded by independent artists for recording and selling their products. Examples of vanity labels are Bob Culbertson, Watson and Business, Lao Tizer, Esteban Ramirez and many others. (Darren &amp; Winn , 2003). At present, CCM is the microlabel that strives to convert into independent label.<br /><br />In the first place, the competition among rivals is carried out on the basis of popularity of the performer and tunes recorded by their companies. Recording studios intensively compete to attract popular of promising artists to sign contracts with them. If the tunes or artists are highly popular, price is secondary factor which may influence the competition. However, if the artist is lesser-known or tunes recorded are not very popular, price does play role as the competition and strategy factor. In the distribution process of the rivals, the particular importance is attached to getting access to traditional channels of new music distribution, such as retail musical stores, major chain record stores, independent record stores and Internet distributors such as Amazon. These means are very important for selling CDs of the artists apart from direct sales on their performances. Also, another factor that greatly influences CD sales is advertising of songs and radio promotion and transmission.<br /><br />For CCM, rivalry is by far the most important competitive pressure source. The strong competition from rival producers and sellers of music can be explained by the fact that the performers of CCM are not known to the wide public in comparison with the artists of the first-tier and independent labels.<br /><br />The competitive threat of new entry, is, to the opposite, by far the weakest competitive force, ranked between weak and moderate. Barriers for entry are not high for the new producers of recorded songs, especially those targeting limited segment of the market and employing cheap digital technology of recording. CCM can serve the brightest example of such entry. Such cheap digital recording technology can be assembled nowadays for no more than $5,000. Still, expensive analogue technologies keep costing hundreds thousand or even millions. The technology employed by the agency automatically determines its assets and rank in the music <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> recording industry. Besides cost of the equipment, the main subject of the competition for new entrants will be distinct market share and sales volume. Considerable sales volume, in its turn, depends on the ability of new entrants to attract famous, popular or widely known performers and singers whose tunes are able to get to the top of the popularity charts. Given the fact that virtually all popular artists have already signed contracts with major recording studios, this is significant barrier for new entrants. Another important barrier is gaining considerable channel of distribution. Generally, large distribution centers and songs CD retailers are interested in selling the audio of famous performers and unwilling to accept the products of relatively unknown artists. For the CCM, the threat of new entry is not very strong, since the business targets rather narrow market segment. Though, if the new entrant uses the same recording technologies, distribution channels and targets the same niche in the market, the fact may become an issue of major importance.<br /><br />Competition from substitute products can be considered moderate competitive force in the new music industry. Such substitute products are be presented in the form of providing consumers with possibility to listen new music with other that CD means such as radio, cable TV songs channels, live concerts, local bars or night clubs with live performances or recorded audio, and internet. Internet has become by far the most important and strong substitute to traditional buying CD, since audio provided on the web is most often   cheaper or completely free and is not much inferior in quality than .wma format of CDs. Therefore, for certain amount of people these means serve as effective substitutes, but for audio fan, buying official CD is obligatory. In the case of Colorado Creative Audio, people can enjoy the performance on live concerts of these artists and decide not to buy their CD. Therefore, from CCM's viewpoint, this may be regarded as fairly significant competitive force.<br /><br />The forces left are bargaining power of suppliers and bargaining power of buyers and collaborative buyer seller relations, which are both strong competitive force.<br /><br />The first, bargaining power of suppliers depends on the popularity and reputation of artists. Those who are popular and whose recordings sell well, have strong bargaining power, they can chose among numerous recording studios. CCM specializes on recordings of infamous artists, and therefore it enjoys weak bargaining power, since artists involved with CCM do not have many alternatives for studio record and CD distribution.<br /><br />Bargaining power of buyers and collaborative buyer-seller relations is very strong competitive force. The major distributors of recorded music supply CDs to the leading new music stores and other retailers of music, these leading distributors stock about 40,000 copies of a CD and work on 60-90 working schedule retaining the privilege of full return of investments for the unsold copies. So called &quot;one-stops&quot; are distributors which provide products for the independent songs stores in smaller quantities and very often with limited range of music types. Generally such distributors prefer to handle stock CDs of the very popular artists or at least well-known artists and often they are not interested in going into distribution of CDs of unknown performers. Therefore, CCM faces great difficulty in acquiring decent and formal distribution, especially in getting its products sold by such new music stores as Sam Goody, Tower Records, Borders Books and Music, and [...]

In 2000, the   business sold 30,000 of Darren Curtis Skanson CDs and received net profit of $4,292.00. The organization aims at increasing its client base, obtain far more popularity, and develop the firm from microlabel towards the impartial a single.<br /><br />Vision/objectives<br /><br />The company eyesight of   Colorado Innovative Music consists of 3 elements - Core Value, Core Objective and Visionary Goals (Thompson, Strickland, 2003).<br /><br />Core values of CCM are quality, creativeness, and superb consumer services. The core purpose of the business is always to make a lot more men and women pay attention to classical and light acoustic songs and admire it. As for the visionary targets, the strategic dilemma in the organization arises. Thus, on the list of visionary goal is always to make the audio <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamFyb21pci1qYWdyLWplcnNleXMtYy0xMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Jaromir Jagr Jersey</a> produced, played and recorded by CCM musicians, observed by larger audience. The other visionary goal that does not fully go in line using the very first one would be to get the huge custom industry for that company's merchandise and providers. The collision right here is inside the primary worth and goal of the organization: inside the first situation the interest is attached to the item, music, whilst the second one is focused on the improvement in the company. This dilemma could be the subject of strategic alternative with the company, which will be outlined and mentioned later.<br /><br />At the present moment, the main objectives with the company are: positioning the business in opposition to its rivals, development of distribution channels, improvement with the goods and enhancement in the product line, anticipating changes in need and adjusting the firm's method to respond to them.<br /><br />Operating atmosphere<br /><br />The firm operates on American market place which is characterised by political and inexpensive stability, specialized developments in generating and distribution processes, large variety of potential buyers, broad desire and intensive competition.<br /><br />Business product<br /><br />Company model could be the mechanism for the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaGxmbHllcnNqZXJzZXlzdG9yZS5jb20vamVmZi1jYXJ0ZXItamVyc2V5cy1jLTE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Jeff Carter Jersey</a> business to generate the revenues and profits. It contains approach and implementation thereof and ought to solution this kind of questions as how the organization selects its clients, the way it differentiates its products from these or rivals, how it creates utility for the clients, how it acquires and preserves them, advertising and distribution methods, the way it allocates its assets and derives gain. As for advertising and distribution methods for Colorado Inventive Songs, the certain interest is attached to Net element with the distribution and its capabilities.<br /><br />World wide web is just not only alternative strategy to standard techniques of audio distribution, but additionally a fantastic opportunity for artists and music-recording companies to expose these products to wide community. The advantages of such indicates are reduced cost of entrance and huge size of prospective consumers industry. Conventional chain of songs distribution consists of such elements as writer/performer, publisher, musical instruments firm, reside performances, venue equipment and solutions, recording, studio gear and companies, recorded performances including night clubs, bars, company music, broadcast, film and music videos, and retail. They are standard phases via which the track or any other musical product need to move to get to the final customer. World wide web tends to make this chain of distribution shorter and simpler, and therefore internet-based marketing, advertisement and distribution might be considered a brand new organization design to base the business on. Additional data on virtual distribution is going to be mentioned in related part.<br /><br />CCM enterprise design consists of following elements:<br /><br />Value Proposition: pleasure of customers' wants in good quality <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nhlflyersjerseystore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlflyersjerseystore.com</a> classic audio;<br /><br />Marketplace Section: white females (predominantly) and douleur of 40-60 age assortment. The market section wants to become further expanded.<br /><br />Worth Chain Construction: construction in the organization to be described beneath<br /><br />Revenue era: via product sales, direct product sales in distinct; income generation roots need to have to be expanded.<br /><br />Place in the value network: enters the most specialized market section. A large number of competitors from all 4 segments from the market; business may be complemented by means of alliance with larger recording business.<br /><br />Competitive technique: company's approach primarily focused on differentiation rather than cost management method, by means of web distribution permits creating the merchandise of CCM cheaper than those of rivals.<br /><br />Marketplace segmentation, concentrating on, positioning<br /><br />The songs recording business has 4 plainly identifiable segments: key recording studios, impartial labels, micro-labels and vanity labels. Key companies have big quantities of artists under contracts, reaching the amount of 100, focus on several types of audio - rock, nation, jazz, classical, traditional as well as other, and have formal and dependable nationwide and international channels of distribution. Impartial labels have 10-100 artists beneath agreement, concentrate on recording of one particular or two major new music types and have either national or most usually regional distribution channels.<br /><br />Micro-labels have much less then 10 artists beneath contract and are tightly targeted on definite design of music. They are characterised by modest staff and manager performing because the top artist with the studio. Micro-labels have seldom formal distribution technique and seriously depend on immediate sales to followers and wholesale to clubs and specialty merchants.<br /><br />Vanity labels section may be the fourth, the final as well as the most specialized section in the music recording sector. They're founded by unbiased artists for recording and promoting their merchandise (Darren&amp; Winn, 2003). At present, CCM could be the micro-label that strives to convert into unbiased label. As a result, CCM currently occupies instead narrow market niche of classic and conventional acoustic music admirers within the age of 40-60, predominantly white, middle class females throughout the territory of the United States, although the key part with the buyers is targeted in Colorado region. This is the end result of marketplace targeting, when the studio developed the measure of segment attractiveness - loyal clients and followers of performers; new music, and selected appropriate focus on segment.<br /><br />Today, the business wishes to change the section it operates into. To expand the company's market place section it should develop product differentiation aimed at selling different items with distinct characteristics to different market segments. So far such differentiation is not created.<br /><br />Around the basis thereof, the positioning tactic now applied by the company is differentiation positioning, which lies in filling much less aggressive, smaller market place niche in which the firm locates its brand and attracts its buyers.<br /><br />Goods<br /><br />At existing, the organization disposes of 4 product lines and 11 different documents. The brand name names of the Firm are: Darren Curtis Skanson, Acoustictherapy, Andrew Thomas Harling and Audio for Candles. The type of the music presented may be the same throughout all the brands: light classical guitar.<br /><br />Distribution channels<br /><br />The distribution channels of CCM are predominantly immediate revenue. These include sales inside the gig, shopping mall distribution and in the back end (which contains CD order by means of 800 number, website sales, mail order). In 2000 CCM sold thirty,000 Darren Curtis Skanson CDs, predominantly via direct revenue. Though, standard chains of distribution are a lot more successful and they include key distributors, one-stop distributors, unbiased record stores and major chain record stores. Developing standard distribution strategies is certainly one of CCM's primary tasks.<br /><br />Financial positions<br /><br />CCM is a micro-label, the third with the four segments in audio recording sector. Therefore, in contrast towards the premier recording studios as Columbia, Sony New music, EMI and BMG, which possess huge financial actives, financial place of CCM is rather moderate. In 2000, the business reached total revenue quantity of $216,614.05 and net income of $4,292.00, which, though, was 4 times much less than net cash flow in 1998 (amounting to 20,626.70) and nearly the same as in 1997 and 1999.<br /><br />Main strategic issues<br /><br />Main strategic issues in the business are formulated by the supervisor of the   firm, Darren Skanson, within the Case Study for Colorado Imaginative Music (Darren &amp; Winn, 2003) and include the following:<br /><br />* develop a profitable new music recording label with expanded range of artists and performers;<br /> * position Darren Curtis Skanson label to compete with significant artists who have contracts to Sony Classical. For this, acquiring conventional   distribution approaches is necessary;<br /> * create new product line similar to Acoustcitherpay which will be saleable and provide funds for your previous two targets.<br /><br />The strategic tasks and ways of their implementation are not uniform and totally complementary. Therefore, the first intention of growing the organization contradicts the easiest and most achievable means of accomplishing the 2nd objective - promote the new music by selling CCM's product lines to recording studio larger than CCM, independent of significant label with access to classic outlets. Thus, the company has to define its prerogative - develop the recording label or promote the songs by implies other than within CCM capabilities.
