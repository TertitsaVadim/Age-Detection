Nope, try 8.30, almost 9. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> Couldn't get back to sleep either.  And on top of that, my special watch doesn't change itself <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> Not too impressed with that.  It's supposed to get a radio signal to keep it constantly the right time.  It was getting the seconds and minutes right, just wouldn't change the hour, no matter how many times I tried to manually adjust it.  Has no dials see, only special little buttons. *rolls eyes* Hey ho
<br /><br />Anyways, went to Fareham to do a bit more Christmas shopping.  Got a load of paper and sellotape and stuff.  Also a neat little battery glitter lamp.  It's so cute! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyways, after that we visited my grandparents.  Granddad should so not be out of hospital yet, he's still a bit rough, but hey.  He's happier at home. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We got home and I managed to stay awake long enough to eat my lunch - yummy southern fried chicken strips and chips - but then when I was going to set up camp in the lounge with my ROAs again, I fell asleep.  4 hours wasted, but hey, I got some sleep.  I've got evenings this week to work on them, so it's not too much of a problem. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Went round to my mate's house while her and my mums went to church.  She did my nails.  Ems, if you read this at all, thanks again! You're such a star! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I was going to attempt to set up for ROA time again after I got back but thought better of it.  I'm so drowsy! Lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyways, I get a bit of a lie in.  I'm on lates all week so at least it's 7,30 instead of 6.30.  So that's ok.
<br /><br />Anyways, I've yet to have tea.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

My alarm went off at 7.30 after frequent disturbances by my cats during the night <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> Hey ho.  I'm completely bunged up to the eyeballs but again, hey ho.  Bit of an occupational hazard in a nursery.
<br /><br />I started work at 8.30 after going round and changing a couple of the clocks.
<br /><br />Claire made my day by bringing in a chocolate cake her other half didn't like.  Hey, it's chocolate! I'll eat it! Lol.  I do love a bit of chocolate cake! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I did some handprinting with red and black paint, finger painting with green paint, basically made loads of mess.  Gathered a few observations.  Same old really.
<br /><br />In a way it was quite hectic cos we had so many and staff illness but they were all so good and when some of them were taken in the garden it left us with very few.  Even more quiet!
<br /><br />Lunch was really early for a late shift at 12.  Went and got myself orange juice to dose up with vitamin C and sudafed to dose up on paracetamol! Lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> Then again, after the last time I had trouble with my sinuses - resulting in a visit to the hospital <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> - I'd rather try anything to aleviate the pain.
<br /><br />Anyways, they all went quite quickly this evening.
<br /><br />Spent the evening working on more ROA stuff.  That deadline is closing in on me rapidly.  Especially where I lost yesterday from falling asleep! Lol! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />But there we go.  That's basically my day.  See y'all tomorrow!
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="66c3afcbfa12d905aad1051c3790a538" url=""><![CDATA[Happy (?) Halloween<br/><br/>Not so happy I think.  Woken several times in the night by my cats, then woken before my alarm by my mum.  But hey, I should be used to it on a late shift.  She always wakes me before my alarm. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Cos it's Halloween we're allowed to wear hats and things, minimal dressing up for us cos it scares the kids.  I ask for my hat to be retrieved from the dressing up box.  &quot;Oh, it's at the back of the cupboard right at the bottom.  We can get it if you *really* want it but wouldn't you like a new one?&quot; Whatever.  They buy me a new one.  Not as nice but hey. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I run into work with my coat over my arm instead of on cos it's still really not overly cold yet.  I only take it in cos it's dark on the way home and slightly colder.  It must have been while my coat was over my arm that I dropped my phone.  It had been in my inside coat pocket. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />The morning was alright, but lunchtime couldn't come quick enough.  I was starving.  Halfway through my lunchbreak, Claire comes into the staffroom.  &quot;Anyone have a Bagpuss charm on their phone?&quot; I'm like, yeah me.  She hands me a pile of something wrapped in a piece of blue-roll cos it's wet and I see my phone smashed beyond repair. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> I just burst out laughing.  I knew that if I didn't I'd have just started crying right there and then.
<br /><br />I phoned my dad on the nursery phone and he brought me my mum's spare one (she has one I bought her for general use and a really old one which has all her work contacts on).  Luckily my SIM card wasn't damaged and also luckily, it worked in my mum's phone cos she's Vodaphone and I'm O2.  At least I have a sort of backup.  I won't be able to get down town to Carphone Warehouse until at least Saturday now.  It's only Tuesday... Well, not right now.  It's half past midnight. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyways, the afternoon went quite quickly.  With it being Tuesday all the kids went home quite quickly which they tend to do on a Tues.  We were all able to leave 10 minutes early cos even the kids off the other units had all gone home too! At least I could get that out of the way.
<br /><br />I get home to find that the dogs were shut in my room and had chewed up one of the Christmas presents I'd bought at the weekend. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> So not impressed.  Everything has been stashed underneath my bed now cos it's inaccessible to pretty much anyone but me cos no one else wants to be crawling underneath it in the dark.  It's completely enclosed.
<br /><br />But hey.  Halloween so wasn't overly happy for me.  I sat in the lounge and went through a bit more ROA work.  Roll on the weekend.  Hopefully they'll all be done, dusted and out of the way.  Forgotten about until Sam gives them back with all the amendments I need to make! Lol!
<br /><br />Anyways, I'm exhausted, my cold's getting worse, so I'm going to bed.  Night!
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="de044367dc8d6540f0a29bb57b9778" url=""><![CDATA[Roll on the weekend...<br/><br/>Ok, it's official.  I can't wait until Saturday.  I'm still without my little phone <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> and I miss it.  Borrowing my mum's is alright, but I miss mine.
<br /><br />My throat is so getting worse.  I sound like a bloke when I talk at times and others I can't even make a noise.  Oh, and the times in between that I make a sound only bats can hear <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Today wasn't too bad.  It was quite quiet, but it could have done with being just that little bit quieter so we could have time to work on our ROAs.  Tomorrow's the last night we'll have.  Hopefully staff meeting will be an ROA night.  If not, I'm kinda worried I won't have everything done in time.  I might just stick it all in and say, hey Sam, it's there, just needs finishing.  We get them back for amendments anyways!
<br /><br />Nothing overly interesting happened today really.  Watched a bit of TV in the evening, did ROA work.  Obviously.  Got really annoyed with my binder and wanted to hurl it out the window, but I remained calm and collected and resolved to just screw up the thing it chewed! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> Hey ho.  I'll do that at work.
<br /><br />That's about it really.  Other than the fact that today I changed my calendars over and it seems like someone told the weather that it's November now cos it's suddenly got really cold early and late.  During the day it's chilly but I still went out to get my lunch without a coat on.  I had two t-shirts and a jumper, but no coat! Lol!
<br /><br />Anyways, I'm tired.  Night!

		<document id="7cec131f5ddf5ef72c2a44b3eef27286" url=""><![CDATA[I Can't Wait... For The Weekend To Begin!<br/><br/>I know, I completely didn't have the energy to write an entry yesterday.  I was up until almost 3am working on those damn ROAs.  At least it's all finished and sorted now.  I've just got a few little add-ons to complete which won't take long.
<br /><br />But anyways.  Yesterday was nice.  Quite a peaceful day, just a really REALLY long evening.  I also found out that I've got my Team Leader interview on Tuesday. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> So nervous, but hey, here goes.
<br /><br />Today was really cool, just seemed to go on cos I was so tired.  Strangely enough, by the evening I was really hyper! Lol.
<br /><br />The nursery is having an open day tomorrow for prospective parents and so we spent a good deal of the afternoon cleaning and making pretty the place.  Not bad if I do say so myself.  Though we were annoyed that one of the children left 10 minutes late! Hey ho.
<br /><br />I'm looking forward to having a full evening to myself without having to sit and do ROAs.  And I'm also looking forward to the weekend, even though tomorrow will mean a trip to the mobile phone hospital to see if my little b
<br />mowbli needs emergency surgery to repair it or give it a transplant and give me a new one.
<br /><br />Anyways, I'm off to chill.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />I went down town this morning to get my phone sorted.  It cost me £30 to get a replacement and that's with insurance! I dread to think how much it would have been without! Lol! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> But hey, on the upside, I'm getting one of those cool red slvr phones. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdirect.motorola.com%2Fhellomoto%2FRed%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/Red/</a> - mine's the slvr one, not the flip razr phone.  Hopefully it'll arrive at my house on Tuesday/Wednesday.  I'll letcha know.
<br /><br />But hey, after that we came home to watch a little bit of the &quot;Agatha Christie's Poirot&quot; weekend cos me and my mum love a good mystery, but I fell asleep for most of the afternoon <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> I woke up when my dad got home at like 3pm! Waste of a day! But hey ho, no ROAs to do!
<br /><br />We went to Asda, bought a bit of shopping, then went back home.  Nothing overly interesting.  Though we did set off our fireworks in the garden.  I'll get a couple of the photos up eventually.  They're not brilliant, but they captured the moment! Lol!
<br /><br />Anyway, I'm exhausted.  Probably the 4 hours sleep on Friday night that did it, threw my routine out.  So, I's offskies.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

I didn't go anywhere until this evening.  I tidied my room a bit.  I did the last few bits on my ROAs so they're finished now.  I watched a bit of TV, listened to a bit of music.  Sod all really.
<br /><br />In the evening we went to my mate's house where she gave me a pedicure.  Not as bad as I thought it'd be.  But when we got there, we found that someone was stabbed to death near one of the local schools! I phoned my friend who lives down that road and she said that a friend of hers drove past at 9am and there was no sign of the police, yet when they went past a couple hours later they had the full on forensic team out, white tent and everything.  Problem is, according to the police it happened around 7am.  And there was no sign of the police until much later.  In some ways it's a good thing it happened on a Sunday.  Had it happened tomorrow, a kid on their way to junior/infant school might have found him! And yet, in the news article I've found say he was found at 7.  Strange.  I'm more inclined to believe my 'eye witness' <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />But hey, that's about all that happened today, really.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />We've still got our Jungle Animals displays up cos we don't want to go too over the top too soon, but the Christmas topic started today.  Each member of staff on our unit has an activity each.  Emma had the Christmas folders which we put everything in at the end of the 'term' to send home.  I've got Christmas hats.  But every single child on the baby unit has to do one of each.  We've also got calendars, salt dough tree decorations, christmas cards, all sorts.  It's great, but the only downside is making sure every single child gets a turn at each activity as well as all the rest! Lol, it's great fun! That and we get absolutely covered in glitter.  Really fun.
<br /><br />Nothing overly interesting happened today aside from that.
<br /><br />Anyways, I'm watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory now with that gorgeous Johnny Depp so I'm gonna go watch that.  I'll let ya know tomorrow how the interview for the Team Leadershipfullness goes.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="d18e84358516114eb9be6bbe7f578605" url=""><![CDATA[Interview day!<br/><br/>Today wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  The interview didn't go too badly.  I found out that two other girls have gone for it too.  Jane and Lisa.  Jane I had a feeling would have though she said several times that she hadn't.  Lisa I was surprised about.  She's done a stint in the Busy Bee room and now she's part of the Butterfly room. That's what surprised me.  She's not been on our unit much so doesn't really know much about what we do.  But hey, I wouldn't be too worried if she got it.  I would be if the outsider they're interviewing on Friday got the post.  That would just be strange.
<br /><br />But hey.  I might get it, I might not.  At least I've tried.  S'all good.
<br /><br />The rest of the day went alright.  My new phone arrived! Woohoo! I got my phone back! I just need to put my memory card back into it to get myself-ness back into it.
<br /><br />Aside from that not much else happened today.

		<document id="c5b68cbf858c24558fad4a9d8f1ac5bc" url=""><![CDATA[Wednesday... Almost the weekend, right?<br/><br/>Ok, so today was good.  I spent far too long this morning playing Mah Jong and watching Stargate and realised that when I left I had 15 minutes to get to work! Lol! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> Hey ho
<br /><br />Work wasn't too bad.  We had a couple who didn't come in. Couple went downstairs for visits.  Same old really.
<br /><br />Oh, we did get one interesting thing today.  Secret Santa!! Carly came around with the slips for us to choose who we'd be buying for.  I got Hannah.  I know what she likes, but it's trying to find something she would like.  Something along the lines of Westlife, Nigel Harman, Superman/girl, stuff like that, Tinkerbell.  That sorta stuff.  Just have to wait and see if I find something.  Probably won't be doing the actual SS until the last staff meeting before Christmas which'll probably be the 14th December.
<br /><br />The afternoon was much better.  They were all going home really early! It was brilliant, bless their hearts! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> By the time I left at 5.30, out of the 15 we started with, we had 5 left.  I love it when they all go early.  Makes our tidying up sessions much easier to do!
<br /><br />I found out also that my little brother (well, not little, he's 17) has been given a court summons to give evidence.  One of his 'mates' beat up a paramedic while he was drunk.  Prat, that's all I can say! Lol.  Hey ho.  My brother's quite worried about it and I don't blame him, but dad and hopefully mum'll be there with him.
<br /><br />But anyways, I got eps of Stargate to watch and nothing else of much interest to tell you about so...

It was strange not having Sam there, but I guess we'll have to get used to that cos she leaves in two weeks for her maternity leave.  Today was just an appointment or something.
<br /><br />Not sure what I can tell you really.  Nothing overly interesting happened.  Did an activity, did some creative... well, Jane did.  Same old really.
<br /><br />Got home to find mum telling me she's probably going to be minding a 15 month old as of next week.  Can't wait! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Took the dog for a walk, watched Girls of the Playboy Mansion, Miracle on 34th Street, nothing much of interest really.

		<document id="50c2b418e6bf821da7c307922be96915" url=""><![CDATA[Missed yesterday, so here it is now<br/><br/>Yesterday was a really good day.
<br /><br />We planned for Children in Need at work which will only be happening on Friday this year, whereas in previous years, it's been all week leading up to it.  We'll be doing all sorts of activities, but hopefully the staff will be able to get involved in the dressing up side of things too.  I love wearing non-uniform.  This year it's red and yellow and wacky hair!
<br /><br />Got my hours.  I'm on earlies all week except Friday when I'm doing lates.
<br /><br />The kids were all really good, things were really calm.
<br /><br />I reorganised the carer lists so that we can actually read them.  Lol, they were a bit faded and out of date.  Carer children were still on there that had moved rooms months ago were still on there!
<br /><br />Oh, and I was called into the office just before 5.  I didn't get the team leader position, but neither did anyone else, Jane, Lisa or outside applicant.  What's gonna happen is Lisa's been made a senior - a step down from team leader: does basically the same thing just isn't involved so much in the management side of things.  Claire boss will be involved when Sam's left and when Claire's not in, Lisa's in charge.  Works out quite well cos I get on really well with Lisa.  Better than I do with Jane.  I was so pleased for her when she told me she'd got that position.  We haven't had a senior in the baby unit in all the time I've been there.  Jane's been offered it before I hear, but turned it down.  Didn't want the responsibility or something, but seems to think she can act the job without it.  Strange woman.  Very bossy, but Lisa's not like that.
<br /><br />Anyways, so in two weeks when Sam leaves, things'll change a bit, or maybe before.  We don't know yet.
<br /><br />After I finished work I grabbed my ROAs (last minute adjustments before they go home) to do over the weekend, and left for my lift home.
<br /><br />In the evening we went to Toys R Us where I bought my Secret Santa present.  A Tinkerbell doll.  It's cute! And then we had Maccy D's.  Watched a few movies then went to bed.
<br /><br />That's about it really.

Stayed in bed til late then went into the lounge with mum to watch the Lord Mayor's Show for the two minutes silence at 11.  I'll be doing that again in a short while.  Seeing as this is Remembrance Sunday.
<br /><br />I went out for a long walk with my brother.  He paid for and booked his CBT for his bike.  I put a deposit on his helmet.  I'm buying that as his Christmas present, but he'll get it as soon as he needs it.  We went to Subways, sat at the ferry, had to move because the wind was blowing the water of the fountain over us, went home.
<br /><br />We watched a bit of Poirot on the TV, then when dad got in, we had chips from the chip shop.
<br /><br />Nothing much of real interest.
<br /><br />But anyways, I'm still in my pyjamas and I've got a few things to do today so I'll be off for now.

Watched the Remembrance service this morning and noticed the silence.  Played a bit of Mah Jong.  The usual really.  Not much.
<br /><br />That's about it really.  I bought a new DVD - War of the Worlds stage production.  I was gutted when I found out I couldn't go to the performance at the BIC, but hey, this is good enough.

<br /><br />Early shift today meaning a nice start of 6.30 for me and 7.30 work time.
<br /><br />Wasn't too bad.  Quite a nice day, though they were all a little manic.  We had to take a group of them into the garden to run off some energy!
<br /><br />Early lunch at 11.30.  Went home for my crumpets and met mum's newest childminded kid.  He's so scrummy! 15 months old and absolutely gorgeous!
<br /><br />The afternoon wasn't too bad either.  Nothing overly memorable, just good fun.  We started sending the ROAs home today so the parents should have enough time to look through them by the parents' evening on Thursday.  Looking forward to that.
<br /><br />Finished around 5 today.  Went home.  Watched a film, went to Asda to get some more printer paper and talked my mum into buying me a £40 coat! Lol, it's nice though.  Good old George!
<br /><br />Watched I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! at 9pm.  So amusing! I already hate David Gest! He's such a prick! Head right up his own arse! I mean, URGH! Yuck, dirty old man.
<br /><br />Hey ho. I better go bed.  I'm tired and it's another early morning for me tomorrow.
<br /><br />Laterz!xx <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Day started early again but it wasn't too bad.  Found out quite early on that we wouldn't have Sam.  She's back tomorrow.  Hope her back is alright.  We always worry that she might have started earlier than her due date whenever she's not in lately.
<br /><br />It's mad at work, lol.  3 of them are pregnant now! Sam, though she's nearly reached her due date, Karen, who's due in March I think, and Sam (different Sam, this is Sam M, not Sam <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> who told me today she's 5 weeks.  Best of luck to her! Shame though, she's leaving us in January to move to Oxfordshire.  I'll miss her, I like Sam.
<br /><br />Lunch was alright, had a sarnie, nothing interesting.
<br /><br />Did loads of messy play with glitter.  Silver and white stuff on a snowflake.  Very pretty.  Turned out quite nice.  And cos of the not so nice weather we had to stay inside.  So we had trips downstairs to play in the artroom and the downstairs dining room with the bikes and chalks and things.
<br /><br />This evening I watched Wargames.  Not seen that in ages.  Strange seeing such a young Matthew Broderick.
<br /><br />Watched I'm A Celebrity... again.  David is still an arse.  Ant and Dec are still the best part of the whole program!
<br /><br />Anyways, over eaten.  Had a take-out pizza and managed to scoff through the lot.  My appetite's normally really small <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />hey ho, time for bed.

<br /><br />Hmm, what can I say about today though? Well, um, I had an early lunch.  11.30.  We made little robbins with brown tissue paper and red fur fabric.  Um, not really much of interest.  We started preparing the displays for next week.
<br /><br />Can't even remember what else we did! Lol.  Terrible memory I have!
<br /><br />This evening was quite nice though.  Sat and watched Star Wars: A New Hope on the lounge TV with the surround sound.  Watched a bit of I'm A Celebrity... and that's about it.
<br /><br />I'll wander now though.  I'm so tired.

<br /><br />The evening was spent at Boots in Fareham shopping and having dinner in Burger King, then we watched the live trial of I'm A Celebrity... How hilarious was that!
<br /><br />Friday was great.  Children in Need day! We all went in wearing red and yellow and most of the kids had wacky hair.  I tried to do wacky hair but it's not quite long enough to put hair ties in.  The day went really well.  Our numbers were low and the kids had loads of fun, despite the practically torrential rain we had! Luckily the rain stopped for long enough for me to go get my lunch!
<br /><br />The evening was spent watching Children In Need, though we turned over for an hour at 9 to watch I'm A Celebrity... then watched QI while the news was on BBC1, then turned back for the rest of the CIN show.  Though after the news it wasn't quite so good so put a Stargate DVD on.
<br /><br />I'll chat about today later on after I get back from Carly's party, so...

<br /><br />We went down town in the morning and I got a new case for my camera, even though the damn thing is so annoying! Doesn't work properly.  Looks like I'm getting a decent Hitatchi one for Christmas though!
<br /><br />I spent the afternoon slobbing out really.  Got ready for the party, had a chinese, the usual really! Lol!
<br /><br />The party was fantastic! Lisa P, Sarah and Hannah were all a bit tipsy before we even got there! Lol, but hey ho.  It was so much fun! Couldn't get Emma or Lisa V up on the dancefloor for love nor money... until Take That came on with Never Forget then they were both up!
<br /><br />I kinda regret wearing my chinese top cos it was a little thick and I overheated on the dancefloor, but hey ho.  Overall it was a fantastic night! I had a great time!
<br /><br />Got home just after midnight and found Steven on the couch asleep.  He passed his CBT yesterday!
<br /><br />He'd left the TV on so I asked him what it was, he sat up, and answered it was carbon and insisted it was carbon, though dad confirmed it was actually Aliens. Lol, my brother's hilarious when he's asleep.  He has conversations with the dog and has no memory of them in the morning.
<br /><br />But hey ho.  Today we're been to Fareham.  I bought a halo and some angel wings for the Christmas party in a few weeks, got my uncle Trevor his Christmas pressie (won't say what it is cos he's on here from time to time!), just stuff really.
<br /><br />So anyways, I'm off now.

Although I was woken really early. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> Typical when I could have had that extra hour in bed for starting work late.  Hey ho.
<br /><br />Work wasn't too bad.  The kids were pretty good.  We got to take them out into the garden and we've started to create our Christmas displays.  We've been doing the topic for ages, but now we're actually starting the stuff that'll be displayed for all to see with the decorations that will be going up next week! Can't wait! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Lunch wasn't too eventful.  The day went by without much of interest.
<br /><br />The evening wasn't too bad.  Went to Asda with Steven, bought some lunch and stuff.
<br /><br />Sat in the lounge and watched most of The Fifth Element on DVD with him before mum came back and changed the channel to watch the rest of I'm A Celebrity...
<br /><br />That's about it really.  Gotta go find my dad's birthday present now.  I'm probably gonna give it to him when he gets in cos his birthday's tomorrow.  He gets in at nearly midnight and I won't really get a chance to see him in the morning, so...

		<document id="317b26b651fcef386800f0c682147b6" url=""><![CDATA[200!<br/><br/>There's not really all that much to report about yesterday.  Came and went, really.
<br /><br />Think the only interesting thing about yesterday was the fact that it was my dad's 45th birthday.  I gave him his present before I went to sleep, knowing I wouldn't see him much on the actual day.  I think I only actually saw him for 30 minutes in the morning before I went to work, then he was at work until late last night when I got home.
<br /><br />But hey ho.
<br /><br />Today wasn't too bad.  Evening was a little mental, but we got help sorting out the evening issues.
<br /><br />The best thing about today was definitely the episode of the Simpsons with the voice of Richard Dean Anderson <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> (Colonel O'Neill of Stargate SG1) followed by the 200th episode of Stargate <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />.  It was so good! I really wish I'd recorded it now.  I really fell the need to watch it again! Hmm.. Think I'll go and investigate whether they'll be repeating it at all! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Thursday was alright.  Numbers were very quiet so we got a lot of extra stuff done.  Like writing up evaluations, organising the next topic for after Christmas, planning the creative things... that sorta stuff.
<br /><br />Friday was cool cos I got to be a Butterfly for the morning which I haven't done in ages.  It was really good! I had loads of fun.  We also did our little goodbye Sam presentation.  We took all the Butterflies and Busy Bees up to the baby unit to present her with her gifts and cards and to say goodbye cos she's now on maternity leave.  It's gonna be mad without her.  Really weird.
<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget that Friday was payday! Woohoo!
<br /><br />Yesterday was loads of fun.  Got my hair cut, went shopping, sat on buses, that sorta stuff.
<br /><br />Started off on a bad note though.  On the way home from getting my hair cut I return my mum's phone call.  Didn't even hear my phone go off while I was in the hairdressers.  Turns out she was looking for the CDs we'd bought the day before.  She then said she'd warn me before I got home that she'd sent Steven to Haslar hospital.
<br /><br />Turns out he came off his bike during the early hours of Friday night/Saturday morning.  He skidded on a wet drain and ended up crashing off on the other side of the road.  He came out of it with just a fractured scaphoid (somewhere in his wrist) and a friction burn on his elbow from his jacket scrapping on the floor.  He was lucky.  Had that been during the day the road would have been busier and he could have gone under someone's wheels or something.  He's alright.  More gutted about his lovely new bike.
<br /><br />But hey.  As long as he's alright.  He's got to go to Queen Alexandra hospital on Thursday to the fracture clinic.  Lol, he's a regular there.  He's broken so many bones since he was a kid, he's practically got his own personal chair in the waiting room! Lol.
<br /><br />Anyways, better go.  Not dressed yet! Still in my pjs.

<br /><br />I sat in my pyjamas til almost midday.  I watched a couple of films with my mum.  I went to Asda to buy some new shoes for our Christmas meal on Friday and replace the glue I used up from mum's stock while doing my ROAs and some pizzas for my tea.
<br /><br />I think the best part was when dad took me out on my brother's new bike (a Yahama Beluga).  Steven can't yet cos he's not fully licenced whereas my dad is so he took me.  So much fun! Absolutely wicked!
<br /><br />Then we went to a friend's house where I had my nails done and Steven bought us chips.
<br /><br />We came home, watching I'm A Celebrity and that's about it really.

		<document id="727c7cb8dd9a278682fcc4bc680582d6" url=""><![CDATA[Monday. All Change!<br/><br/>Hawo! Today wasn't too bad.  Our numbers crept down so quickly towards the end of the day.
<br /><br />I spent the entire day pretty much wearing glitter after starting to make their hats for the Christmas dinner.  Lol, glitter and sequins: my favourite!
<br /><br />Lunch wasn't too bad.  Met our new girl, Lisa T, for the first time.  I didn't realise it was her! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> Where she doesn't have a uniform yet I thought she was a student! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> Sorry! She's nice though.
<br /><br />The afternoon was pretty much spent with finishing the rest of the hats for the children that were in, then later on I started to cut out the rest of the display stuff.
<br /><br />I was called into the office to go through my interview questions for the team leader position and after that I was told about my little change.
<br /><br />While Lisa P has joined the baby unit as a senior, I will be joining the Butterfly unit after my week off next week! I'm really excited now.  There was a point where I was like... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> I'm not sure.  I wanna stay where I'm settled, but now I'm like... I wanna change! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> I really can't wait! It's gonna be so cool! And a lot of them are children who've been through the baby unit so I know most of them.
<br /><br />The tough part will be getting used to a slightly different way of doing things.  But hey, s'a challenge.  And I look forward to it.
<br /><br />Anyways, I just found A New Hope on TV so I'm gonna go and become a jedi while I watch.
