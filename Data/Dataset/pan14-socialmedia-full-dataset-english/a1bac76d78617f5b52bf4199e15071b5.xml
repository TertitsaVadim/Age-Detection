<br />caressed by the soft moonlight,
<br />gave magical feelings to the night.
<br /><br />The soft blue glow,
<br />the lovers' words that then did flow,
<br />their lips closer and closer
<br />until, locked in the throes
<br />of a passionate embrace,
<br />he decided to express his feelings,
<br />to keep her safe.
<br /><br />He whispered softly,
<br />his words like music to her ears,
<br />&quot;I Love You,&quot;
<br />and her response the same,
<br />heard like the gentle breeze,
<br />&quot;And I, love you, forever.&quot;
<br /><br />That was the night they promised
<br />to be together through everything,
<br />each to care for the other when old and gray
<br />A lovers' pact
<br />the most likely to last.

<br />Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa...
<br />Listen..
<br /><br />Baby come here and sit down, let's talk
<br />I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
<br />Saying that I love you,
<br />But you know, this thing ain't been
<br />No walk in the park for us
<br />I swear it'll only take a minute
<br />You'll understand when I finish, yeah
<br />And I don't wanna see you cry
<br />But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so
<br /><br />How do you let it go? When you,
<br />You just don't know? What's on,
<br />The other side of the door
<br />When you're walking out, talk about it
<br />Everything I tried to remember to say
<br />Just went out my head
<br />So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
<br />'cause I know
<br /><br />There's never a right time to say goodbye
<br />But I gotta make the first move
<br />'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
<br />Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
<br />Girl it's not you, it's me
<br />I kinda gotta figure out what I need (oh)
<br />There's never a right time to say goodbye
<br />But we know that we gotta go
<br />Our separate ways

<br />And it's killing me
<br />Cause there's never a right time
<br />Right time to say goodbye

<br />And I never
<br />Thought I would see the day we grew apart
<br />And I wanna know

<br />What I'm tryna say.
<br />We just can't go on
<br />Pretending that we get along

<br />Millions of people living as foes
<br />Maybe its not to late
<br />To learn how to love
<br />And forget how to hate
<br /><br />Mental wounds not healing
<br />Lifes a bitter shame
<br />Im going off the rails on a crazy train
<br /><br />Ive listened to preachers
<br />Ive listened to fools
<br />Ive watched all the dropouts
<br />Who make their own rules
<br />One person conditioned to rule and control
<br />The media sells it and you have the role
<br /><br />Mental wounds still screaming
<br />Driving me insane
<br />Im going off the rails on a crazy train
<br /><br />I know that things are going wrong for me
<br />You gotta listen to my words
<br />Yeh-h
<br /><br />Heirs of a cold war
<br />Thats what weve become
<br />Inheriting troubles Im mentally numb
<br />Crazy, I just cannot bear
<br />Im living with something that just isnt fair
<br /><br />Mental wounds not healing
<br />Who and whats to blame
<br />Im going off the rails on a crazy train

<br />You mean everything to me.
<br />I love you
<br /><br />Ooooh Ooooh 
<br />Ooh I pray
<br /><br />You were in my dream
<br />Before I even knew that there was a you and me,
<br />Now I can't wait to see your smile,
<br />When I wake up each day,
<br />It makes it worth while
<br />With the kinda love you plant inside, 
<br />Specially with a heart so empty as mine.
<br />All your soft tenderness is the one thing that I don't wanna miss.
<br /><br />I pray,
<br />When it's time for me to say goodbye
<br />I'll never forget looking in your eyes,
<br />I pray,
<br />That I feel your touch 
<br />And that God doesn't forget our love,
<br />I pray,
<br />When I close my eyes,
<br />I can still see visions of you on my mind.
<br />I pray,
<br />That I see you in another life,
<br />I pray that you still by my side.
<br />Oh I pray.
<br /><br />Everything that you give to me,
<br />Only comes in a fantasy,
<br />It seems like life goes by so fast,
<br />But in this time I wanna make it last. (I pray)
<br />I hate that we live to die,
<br />But only God knows why (I pray)
<br />We all have a purpose, 
<br />And to see you again it'll be worth it.
<br /><br />I wish that I could stop time,
<br />I wish that I could rewind,
<br />To the very begining of every second of my life.
<br />To ask God on my hands and knees,
<br />To never let me forget all my special memories.
<br />See I'm only promised today,
<br />And if it's my time to go,
<br />I don't want the love of my life to ever fade away,
<br />So one last time
<br />Let me open my eyes.
<br />To see what my life used to be like.
<br />Oh God.
