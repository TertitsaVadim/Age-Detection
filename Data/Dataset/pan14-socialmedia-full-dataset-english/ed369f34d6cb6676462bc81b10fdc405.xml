<br />And so I say them
<br />Again, once more
<br />Forgetting
<br />I've told you before
<br /><br />Then you give me a kiss
<br />And look into my eyes

<br />by Hugh Coffey
<br /><br />Once upon a time, in the land of my dream
<br />There was a young Knight who searched for his Queen
<br />He followed his quest and he searched all lands through
<br />He searched for his love, he knew would be true.
<br /><br />She has eyes like diamonds, yet dark and so deep
<br />The window of her soul, shows a beauty so sweet
<br />She has hair like an angel, both raven and long
<br />She brings to my heart, love's simple song.
<br /><br />He sought out a wizard, to conjure a spell,
<br />To find this fair princess, that in his heart dwells.
<br />He begged this magician, by all that is right,
<br />Find me my love, my soul's true delight.
<br /><br />She has beauty unequaled, by all in all time,
<br />Her soul is so perfect, it must be with mine,
<br />The wizard did tell him, that this lady he loved,
<br />Was not a mere princess, but an angel from above.
<br /><br />He said all the magic I have in my power
<br />Cannot make this perfection, in any number of hours
<br />He said you should ask for the heavens to send
<br />One of God’s perfect creatures, for your quest to end.
<br /><br />So he prayed long and hard, for 40 long years
<br />He knelt and he begged, and cried many tears.
<br />And finally God looked, at a love that was true
<br />And released from his heaven, a creature like you.
<br /><br />I am that Knight, who sought long and true,
<br />I searched an eternity, just to find you.
<br />You are my Princess, whom I dearly love.
<br />Sent down to me from the heavens above.
<br /><br />I will hold and protect you from life’s many troubles
<br />I will shield your soul, and give love that doubles,
<br />Each day of my life, that I spend with you,
<br />Is likened to heaven, with an Angel it’s true.
<br /><br />To you I will give, all the love that I have,
<br />I will cherish, and honour, as long as live.
<br />And then someday, when death doth make us part,
<br />I will wait in your heaven, for you have my heart.
<br /><br />In heaven, the story shall go on forever
<br />Of a love that is perfect and never will waiver.
<br />For you are my angel, sent down from above,
<br />To have and to hold, and forever to love.

<br />by Cindy Fahey
<br /><br />My heart was once an open book 
<br />Pages blowing in the wind 
<br />Each page with a torn and tattered look 
<br />Pages that seemed to have no end 
<br /><br />Each page was ripped out freely 
<br />Their value left unknown 
<br />For those pages represented me
<br />My heart beat on its own 
<br /><br />Once the pages were all but lost 
<br />I opened up my eyes 
<br />I needed help at any cost
<br />It was then I realized 
<br /><br />By tearing out my pages 
<br />Giving without a cause 
<br />Allowed me to be courageous 
<br />Overlooking obvious flaws 
<br /><br />Mistaken feelings of love 
<br />Were left in the open gaps 
<br />Games I’d grown weary of 
<br />Became a recurring mishap 
<br /><br />With only one page remaining 
<br />I wanted to do things right 
<br />Feeling frightened and untrusting
<br />Then I caught a noble sight 
<br /><br />I knew I’d seen an angel 
<br />One whom I longed to be near 
<br />I took a step, and then I fell 
<br />Forsaken, I shed a tear 
<br /><br />For I knew this angel had seen me
<br />He’d reached out and touched my hand 
<br />But his heart was under lock and key 
<br />So with my open book I ran 
<br /><br />I don’t know where I was running 
<br />The pace was out of control 
<br />And the tears pressing left a blazing sting 
<br />Forewarning my heart and soul 
<br /><br />When I turned the angel was with me 
<br />He’d never left my side 
<br />With honor to me, he entrusted his key 
<br />Then he kissed all the tears I had cried 
<br /><br />He lifted me up so gently 
<br />In his arms I felt secure 
<br />He looked into my eyes to assure me 
<br />That his love for me was pure 
<br /><br />In that moment my heart was dancing 
<br />Like a feather in the breeze 
<br />As if my pages were gently moving
<br />I opened my book to see 
<br /><br />Astonished at what I witnessed 
<br />My pages were all intact 
<br />No more tattered edges 
<br />He had given all of them back

<br />It does not envy,

<br />it is not self-seeking,
<br />it is not easily angered,
<br />it keeps no record of wrongs.

<br />by Anicha250
<br /><br />This could be my first time ever;
<br />As if I was formed from your rib,
<br />Mainly created to complete you,
<br />Shaped to only fit your arms,
<br />Curved to blend into you,
<br /><br />I've been holding myself like a virgin
<br />So that I can keep my dignity for you.
<br />To be touch only by your hands,
<br />Desired by your eyes,
<br />Loved by your lips.
<br /><br />My thoughts of you are insane.
<br />Wet dreams from the idea of
<br />Your hot tongue on my naked skin 
<br />Inflicting me with pleasurable agony;
<br />Emotion that convey fire and desire. 
<br /><br />I inhaled the breeze of passion 
<br />With my eyes closed to keep the moment.
<br />Letting go of my body to dance with yours;
<br />Bursting in spasms of infinite orgasms.
<br /><br />Dreaming of that night,
<br />That day in your arms;
<br /><br />I wish you can read my heart
<br /><br />It says that I only desire you.

<br />she sat there and cried
<br />alone in a cold world
<br />and he was jus a lie
<br />she gave him all he could ask for,
<br />and still that was not enough
<br />but he dosent care anymore
<br />so she pretends to be tough
<br />he thinks love is fake 
<br />but he is forever loved
<br />he says he loves her
<br />but to him love is fake 
<br />no love could occur,
<br />if all he does is like
<br />so she shed these tears, 
<br />for a guy who left
<br />and all she has is fears
<br />and they have not left
<br />she wont let anyone as close,
<br />as she did that boy
<br />no one has ever gotton that close, 
<br />but he treats her like a toy
<br />he told her he loved her,
<br />but to him love is an overused word
<br />he told her forever
<br />but theres no forever she heard
<br />and now shes lonely,
<br />without the love of her life
<br />she wishes he would see, but she needs to say goodbye...
<br />so she sits at her window
<br />and stares at the sky
<br />her head hangs so low 
<br />as she lets out a sigh
<br />tears fall like raindrops
<br />and she lets it all out
<br />she hears sirens from the cops
<br />hes stolen her heart of doubt
<br />for she wishes for a new life
<br />a dream she wont leave
<br />she gets through this strife
<br />for she has been decieved
<br />her heart cant take this pain
<br />so she thinks about letting go
<br />its driving her insane,
<br />she watches out the window
<br />grey clouds start to appear
<br />lighting lights the dark sky 
<br />she wishes he was near, 
<br />she wishes she could fly
<br />she opens the window 
<br />climbs out to the rail
<br />she lets go of what she knows
<br />the life she has failed
<br />thoughts run through her mind
<br />she stands up so tall
<br />shes leaving this life behind
<br />as she steps off

<br />I meet her one night,
<br />such a lovely stranger.
<br />My pulse races madly,
<br />at her approaching danger.
<br />One moment I feel love,
<br />spirit soaring with elation.
<br />The next moment brings heartbreak,
<br />and endless tribulation.
<br />The greatest pleasure in life,
<br />a passionate love affair.
<br />The lowest point in existence,
<br />a heart torn with despair.
<br />Love is the very best
<br />experience in life.
<br />Love is the ultimate,
<br />sadness and strife.
<br />My pain is my love,
<br />my love is my pain.
<br />One day brings me sunshine,
<br />the next brings me rain.
<br />A person seeking love,
<br />has a story to tell.
<br />Of another who loved them,
<br />or their living hell.
<br />When two hearts are in love,
<br />there is nothing else as good.
<br />I'd freeze time in its place,
<br />And change nothing if I could.
<br />When our love's unrequited,
<br />and we're rejected with scorn,
<br />It pierces one's heart,
<br />and we wish we were not born.
<br />Love is capricious...
<br />but what else can I do?
<br />Except fall in love again,
<br />and begin my pain all anew.

<br />Passion, affection and romance is what constitute love but there's more to it.The fact of knowing that u are loved, trusted and cared for by your lover is such an amazing thing that could ever happen in your life time.There are so many joyful memories that u can't forget.Love is a wonderful thing to experience in your life, because it carries sweet and marvelous passion into the heart
