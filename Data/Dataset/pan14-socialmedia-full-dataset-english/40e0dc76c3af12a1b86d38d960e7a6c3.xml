I have found this happens to me when I am in bed using the laptop and ignore the heat issue. If I set the computer to the blankets the air flow is blocked and the computer will have issues. <br /><br />Memory, hard drive disk space and conflict in hardware/software are problems that could also be responsible for the going slower of your computer.
