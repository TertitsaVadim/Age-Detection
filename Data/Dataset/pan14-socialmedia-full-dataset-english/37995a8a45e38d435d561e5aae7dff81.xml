<br /> of the Babies--
<br />I certainly don't think an adult could explain this more beautifully!  
<br /><br />THIS IS FABULOUS!!!
<br /><br />It was written by an 8-year-old named Danny Dutton, who lives in Chula
<br /> Vista, CA. He wrote it for his third grade homework assignment, to
<br /> &quot;explain God.&quot; I wonder if any of us could have done as well?
<br />(.... and he had such an assignment, in California, and someone
<br /> published it, I guess miracles do happen ! ...) 
<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF GOD:
<br />&quot;One of God's main jobs is making people. He makes them to replace the
<br /> ones that die, so there will be enough people to take care of things on
<br /> earth. He doesn't make grownups, just babies. I think because they are
<br /> smaller and easier to make. That way he doesn't have to take up his
<br /> valuable time teaching them to talk and walk. He can just leave that to
<br /> mothers and fathers.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;God's
<br /> second most important job is listening to prayers. An awful lot
<br /> of this goes on, since some people, like preachers and things, pray at
<br /> times beside bedtime. God doesn't have time to listen to the radio or
<br /> TV because of this. Because he hears everything, there must be a
<br /> terrible lot of noise in his ears, unless he has thought of a way to turn it
<br /> off.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;God sees everything and hears everything and is everywhere which keeps
<br /> Him pretty busy. So you shouldn't go wasting his time by going over
<br /> your mom and dad's head asking for something they said you couldn't
<br /> have.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Atheists are people who don't believe in God. I don't think there are
<br /> any in Chula Vista. At least there aren't any who come to our church.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Jesus is God's Son. He used to do all the hard work, like walking on
<br /> water and performing miracles and trying to teach the people who didn't
<br /> want to learn about God. They finally got tired of him preaching
<br /> to
<br /> them and they crucified him But he was good and kind, like his father, and
<br /> he told his father that they didn't know what they were doing and to
<br /> forgive them and God said O.K.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;His dad (God) appreciated everything that he had done and all his hard
<br /> work on earth so he told him he didn't have to go out on the road
<br /> anymore. He could stay in heaven. So he did. And now he helps his dad out
<br /> by listening to prayers and seeing things which are importan t for God
<br /> to take care of and which ones he can take care of himself without
<br /> having to bother God. Like a secretary, only more important.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You can pray anytime you want and they are sure to help you because
<br /> they got it worked out so one of them is on duty all the time.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;You should always go to church on Sunday because it makes God happy,
<br /> and if there's anybody you want to make happy, it's God!
<br /><br />Don't skip church to do something you think will be more fun like
<br /> going
<br /> to the beach. This is wrong. And besides the sun doesn't come out at
<br /> the beach until noon anyway.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;If you don't believe in God, besides being an atheist, you will be
<br /> very lonely, because your parents can't go everywhere with you, like to
<br /> camp, but God can. It is good to know He's around you when you're scared,
<br /> in the dark or when you can't swim and you get thrown into real deep
<br /> water by big kids.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;But...you shouldn't just always think of what God can do for you. I
<br /> figure God put me here and he can take me back anytime he pleases.
<br /><br />And...that's why I believe in God

<br />He leaves nothing more to want.
<br /><br />He leads me out of my wilderness
<br />To a place where I can feed and rest.
<br /><br />He calms the storms within
<br />And heals my wounded heart.
<br /><br />When choosing to follow His instruction,
<br />I stop trying to sit on His throne.
<br /><br />Then, I can walk through the storm
<br />Knowing evil can't touch me.
<br /><br />His presence becomes so real
<br />All else is barely noticed.
<br /><br />He directs my every step
<br />So all landmines are missed.
<br /><br />His Spirit swells up within me,
<br />My heart overflows with joy ...
<br /><br />And the love of God 
<br />Begins to exude through me.
<br /><br />It is then that I truly
<br />Dwell in the Lord's House.
<br /><br />And now, I can't imagine having
<br />Chosen to live any other way.

<br /><br />Some people are kind, polite, and sweet spirited until you try to sit 
<br />in their pews.
<br /><br />Many folks want to serve God, but only as advisers.
<br /><br />It is easier to preach ten sermons than it is to live one.
<br /><br />The Good Lord didn't create anything without a purpose, but the 
<br />mosquitoes come close.
<br /><br />When you get to your wit's end, you'll find God lives there.
<br /><br />People are funny, they want the front of the bus, the middle  of the 
<br />road, and the back of the church.
<br /><br />Opportunity may knock once, but temptation bangs on your front door
<br />forever.
<br /><br />Quit griping about your church; if it was perfect, you couldn't belong.
<br /><br />The phase that is guaranteed to wake up an audience:  &quot;And in
<br />conclusion.&quot;
<br /><br />If the church wants a better preacher, it only needs to pray for the 
<br />one it has.
<br /><br />God Himself does not propose to judge a man until he is dead.  So why 
<br />should you?
<br /><br />To make a long story short, don't tell it.
<br /><br />Some minds are like concrete, thoroughly mixed up and permanently set.
<br /><br />Peace starts with a smile.
<br /><br />I don't know why some people change churches.  What difference does 
<br />it make which one you stay home from?
<br /><br />A lot of church members who are singing &quot;Standing on the Promises&quot; 
<br />are just sitting on the premises.
<br /><br />We were called to be witnesses, not lawyers or judges.
<br /><br />Outside of traffic, there is nothing that holds this country back as 
<br />much as committees.
<br /><br />Be ye fishers of men.  You catch them - He'll clean them.
<br /><br />Coincidence is when God chooses to remain anonymous.
<br /><br />Don't put a question mark where God put a period.
<br /><br />Don't wait for six strong men to take you to church.
<br /><br />Forbidden fruits create many jams.
<br /><br />God doesn't call the qualified, He qualifies the called.
<br /><br />God grades on the cross, not the curve.
<br /><br />God loves everyone, but probably prefers &quot;fruits of the spirit&quot; over 
<br />&quot;religious nuts!&quot;
<br /><br />God promises a safe landing, not a calm passage.
<br /><br />He who angers you, controls you!
<br /><br />If God is your copilot - swap seats!
<br /><br />Prayer:  Don't give instructions - just report for duty.
<br /><br />The task ahead of us is never as great as the Power behind us.
<br /><br />The Will of God will never take you to where the Grace of God will 
<br />not protect you.
<br /><br />We don't change the message, the message changes us.
<br /><br />You can tell how big a person is by what it takes to discourage him.
<br /><br />The best mathematical equation I have ever seen:
<br />1 cross + 3 nails = 4 given

<br /><br />Every Sunday afternoon, after the morning service at the church, the Pastor and his eleven-year-old son would go out into their town and hand out Gospel Tracts. This particular Sunday afternoon, as it came time for the Pastor and his son to go to the streets with their tracts, it was very cold outside, as well as pouring down rain. The boy bundled up in his warmest and driest clothes and said; &quot;OK dad, I'm ready.&quot; His Pastor dad asked, &quot;Ready for what?&quot; &quot;Dad, it's time we gather our tracts together and go out.&quot; the Dad responds, &quot;Son, it's very cold outside and it's pouring down rain.&quot; The boy gives his dad a surprised look, asking &quot;But Dad, aren't people still going to Hell, even though it's raining?&quot; the Dad answers , &quot;Son, I am not going out in this weather.&quot; Despondently, the boy asked, &quot;Dad, can I go? Please?&quot; His father hesitated for a moment then said, &quot;Son, you can go. Here are the tracts, be careful son.&quot; &quot;Thanks Dad!&quot; And with that, he was off and out into the rain. This eleven-year-old boy walked the streets of the town going door to doorand handing everybody he met in the street a Gospel Tract. After two hours of walking in the rain, he was soaking, bone-chilled wet and down to his VERY LAST TRACT. He stopped on a corner and looked for someone to hand the tract to, but the streets were totally deserted.Then he turned toward the first home he saw and started up the sidewalk to the front door and rang the doorbell. He rang the bell, but nobody answered. He rang it again and again, but still no one answered. He waited but still no answer. Finally, this eleven-year-old trooper turned to leave, but something stopped him. Again, he turned to the door and rang the bell and knocked loudly on the door with his fist. He waited, something holding him there on the front porch. He rang again and this time the door slowly opened. Standing in the doorway was a 
<br />very sad-looking elderly lady. She softly asked, &quot;What can I do for you son?&quot; With radiant eyes and a smile that lit up her world, this little boy said: &quot;Ma'am, I'm sorry if I disturbed you, but I just want to tell you that *JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU* and I came to give you my very last Gospel Tract which will tell you all about JESUS and His great LOVE.&quot; With that, he handed her his last tract and turned to leave. She called to him as he departed. &quot;Thank you, son! And God Bless You!&quot; Well, the following Sunday morning in church Pastor Dad was in the pulpit. As the service began, he asked, &quot; Does anybody have a testimony or want to
<br />say anything?&quot;  Slowly, in the back row of the church, an elderly lady stood to her feet. As she began to speak, a look of glorious radiance came from her face, &quot;No one in this church knows me. I've never been here before. You see, before last Sunday I was not a Christian. My husband passed on some time ago, leaving me totally alone in this world. Last Sunday, being a particularly cold and rainy day, it was even more so in my heart that I came to the end of the line where I no longer had any hope or will to live. So I took a rope and a chair and ascended the stairway into the attic of my home. I fastened the rope securely to a rafter in the roof, then stood on the chair and fastened the other end of the rope around my neck.
<br />Standing on that chair, so lonely and brokenhearted I was about to leap off, when suddenly the loud ringing of my doorbell downstairs startled me. I thought, &quot;I'll wait a minute, and whoever it is will go away.&quot; I waited and waited, but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more insistent, and then the person ringing also started knocking loudly. I 
<br />thought to myself again, &quot;Who on earth could this be? Nobody ever rings my bell or comes to see me.&quot; I loosened the rope from my neck and started for the front door, all the while the bell rang louder and louder. When I opened the door and looked I could hardly believe my eyes, for there on my front porch was the most radiant and angelic little boy I had ever seen in my life. His SMILE, oh, I could never describe it to you! The words that came from his mouth caused my heart that had long been dead, TO LEAP TO LIFE as he exclaimed with a cherub-like voice,&quot; *Ma'am, I just came to tell you that JESUS REALLY DOES LOVE YOU.&quot; Then he gave me this Gospel Tract that I now hold in my hand. As the little angel disappeared back out into the cold and rain, I closed my door and read slowly every word of this Gospel Tract. Then I went up to my attic to get my rope and chair. I wouldn't be needing them any more. You see &quot; I am now a Happy Child of the KING. Since the address of your church was on the back of this Gospel Tract; I have come here to personally say THANK YOU TO God's little angel who came just in the nick of time and by so doing, spared my soul from eternity in hell.&quot; There was not a dry eye in the church. Shouts of praise and honor to THE
<br />KING resounded off the very rafters of the building. the Pastor Dad descended from the pulpit to the front pew where the little angel was seated. He took his son in his arms and sobbed 
<br />uncontrollably. Probably no church has had a more glorious moment, and probably this
<br />universe has never seen a Papa that was more filled with love and honor for his son... Except for One. This Father also allowed His Son to go out into a cold and dark world. He received His Son back with joy unspeakable, and as all of heaven shouted praises and honor to The King, the Father sat His beloved Son on a throne far above all principality and power and every name that is named.
<br /><br />Blessed are your eyes for reading this message.
<br /><br />Don't let this message die, read it again and pass it to others.
<br /><br />We Will Meet In Heaven! .

<br />I refuse to be downhearted, and here's the reason why:
<br />I have a God who's mighty, Who's sovereign and supreme;
<br />I have a God who loves me, and by grace I'm on His team.
<br /><br />He is all-wise and powerful. Jesus is His name;
<br />Though everything is changeable, My God remains the same.
<br />My God knows all that's happening; Beginning to the end;
<br />His presence is my comfort; He is my dearest Friend.
<br /><br />When sickness comes to weaken me, To bring my head down low,
<br />I call upon my mighty God; Into His arms I go.
<br />When circumstances threaten to rob me of my peace;
<br />He draws me close unto His breast, Where all my strivings cease.
<br /><br />When my heart melts within me, and weakness takes control;
<br />He gathers me into His arms, He soothes my heart and soul.
<br />The great &quot;I AM&quot; is with me. My life is in His hand.
<br />The &quot;Son of the God&quot; is my hope. It's in His strength I stand.
<br /><br />I refuse to be defeated. My eyes are on my God;
<br />He has promised to be with me, As through this life I trod.
<br />I'm looking past all my circumstances, To Heaven's throne above;
<br />My prayers have reached the heart of God I'm resting in His love.
<br /><br />I give God thanks in everything. My eyes are on His face;
<br />The battle's His, the victory mine; He'll help me win the race.
<br /><br />I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!

<br /><br />11 Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.
<br /><br />So.........
<br /><br />If you are a loving friend, send this to everyone, If you get it back, then they really do love you. And always remember, When life hands you Lemons, ask for sugar and make lemonade and call me over!
<br /><br />Good friends are like stars........ You don't always see them, But you know they are always there.

<br /><br />As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.
<br /><br />DIRECTIONS TO OUR FATHER'S HOUSE:
<br /><br />Make a Right onto Believeth Blvd.
<br /><br />Keep straight and go through the Green Light, which is
<br />Jesus Christ.
<br /><br />There, you must turn onto the Bridge of Faith, which
<br />is over troubled water.
<br /><br />When you get off the bridge, make a Right turn
<br />and Keep Straight.
<br /><br />You are on the King's Highway - Heaven-bound.
<br /><br />Keep going for three miles: One for the Father, One for
<br />the Son, and One for the Holy Ghost.
<br /><br />Then exit off onto Grace Blvd.
<br /><br />From there, make a Right turn on Gospel Lane.
<br /><br />Keep Straight and then make another Right on Prayer
<br />Road.
<br /><br />As you go on your way, Yield Not to the traffic on
<br />Temptation Ave.
<br /><br />Also, avoid SIN STREET because it is a DEAD END.
<br />Pass up Envy Drive, and Hate Avenue.
<br /><br />Also, pass Hypocrisy Street, Gossiping Lane, and
<br />Backbiting Blvd.
<br /><br />However, you have to go down Long-suffering Lane,
<br /><br />Persecution Blvd. and Trials and Tribulations Ave.
<br /><br />But that's all right, because VICTORY Street is straight
<br />ahead!
<br /><br />AMEN!!!
<br /><br />SEND THESE DIRECTIONS TO YOUR FRIENDS SO THEY

<br />2 Corinthians 12:9
<br /><br />Recommended Reading
<br />Psalm 124 
<br /><br />&quot;Rather than saying ‘God, here is my problem,' we should put the problem into perspective by saying ‘Problem, here is my God!'&quot; Whoever wrote those words must have understood that there is no problem God cannot handle in our lives. 
<br /><br />When we make our problems the object of our lives, it is easy to become discouraged and forget that we have a God who will sustain us during our trials. However, when we change our perspective and the order of the words, we see that God becomes the object and the focus of our lives. It seems like such a small detail wouldn't matter much, but when you visualize introducing your problems to Almighty God, suddenly they seem smaller, and you realize just how triumphant you can be with His help. 
<br /><br />Often, it is only a matter of changing our perspective in order to overcome adversity. No matter what troubles you are facing, always remember our God is big enough, strong enough, and powerful enough to take care of them. He is the answer to all of life's problems, and He is enough. 
<br /><br />&quot;He comes to us in the brokenness of our health, in the shipwreck of our family lives, in the loss of all possible peace of mind, even in the very thick of our sins. He saves us in our disasters, not from them.&quot;

<br /><br />Take time to seek out the real joys of being alive and aware, of being a unique person with a special purpose. Take time to genuinely give of yourself, for that is the best gift you can offer. 
<br /><br />The time you take to really live is time you will always treasure, and creates value that will always stay with you. The more often you remember what a special and irreplaceable gift it is to be alive, the more you'll have to offer to the lives of those around you.

<br /><br />Just a great reminder before the start of the Holiday Season
<br />   Enjoy-
<br />   When I received this ,,, I read it to the end,, and then I
<br />   stayed in my seat, motionless,, speechless...
<br />     Didn‘t we all do what those people did,, just imagine how it
<br />   felt for Him...
<br />  Please read it and pass it on to people whom you care for,,,
<br />   so they don‘t shut the door again,,,,,  
<br /><br />Remember My Birthday????!!!!!!
<br /><br />As you well know, we are getting closer to my birthday.
<br />   Every year there is a celebration in my honor and I think
<br />   that this year the celebration will be repeated. During 
<br />   this time there are many people shopping for gifts, there 
<br />   are many radio announcements, TV commercials, and in every 
<br />   part of the world everyone is talking about my birthday that 
<br />   is getting closer and closer.
<br /><br />It is really very nice to know, that at least once a year,
<br />   some people think of me. As you know,
<br />   the celebration of my birthday began many years ago.
<br />   At first people seemed to understand and be thankful of all
<br />   that I did for them, but in these times, no one seems to know 
<br />   the reason for the celebration.
<br />   Family and friends get together and have a lot of fun, but they 
<br />   don‘t know the meaning of the celebration.
<br /><br />I remember that last year there was a great feast in my
<br />   honor. The dinner table was full of delicious foods, pastries, 
<br />   fruits, assorted nuts and chocolates.  The decorations were exquisite
<br />   and there were many, many beautifully wrapped gifts. But, do
<br />   you want to know something? I wasn‘t invited. I was the guest of honor 
<br />   and they didn‘t remember to send me an invitation.
<br /><br />The party was for me, but when that great day came, I was
<br />   left outside, they closed the door in my face......... and I wanted to 
<br />   be with them and share their table.
<br />   In truth, that didn‘t surprise me because in the last few
<br />   years all close their doors to me.
<br /><br />Since I was not invited, I decided to enter the party
<br />   without making any noise. I went in and stood in a corner. They 
<br />   were all drinking; there were some who were drunk and telling 
<br />   jokes and laughing at everything. They were having a great time.
<br /><br />To top it all, this big fat man all dressed in red wearing a
<br />   long white beard entered the room saying, &quot;Ho-Ho-Ho!&quot;  He seemed 
<br />   drunk. He sat on the sofa and all the children ran to him, saying :
<br />  &quot;Santa Claus, Santa Claus&quot;...   as if the party were in his honor !
<br />   At 12 midnight all the people began to hug each other; I
<br />   extended my arms waiting for someone to hug me and  .... do you know
<br />   .... no one hugged me.
<br /><br />Suddenly they all began to share gifts. They opened them one
<br />   by one with great expectation.
<br />   When all had been opened, I looked to see if, maybe, there
<br />   was one for me.
<br />   What would you feel if on your birthday everybody shared
<br />   gifts and you did not get one ? I then understood that I was 
<br />   unwanted at that party and quietly left. Every year it gets worse.
<br />   People only remember to eat and drink, the gifts, the parties
<br />   and nobody remembers me.
<br /><br />I would like this Christmas that you allow me to enter into
<br />   your life.
<br /><br />I would like that you recognize the fact that almost two
<br />   thousand years ago I came to this world to give my life for you, 
<br />   on the cross, to save you.
<br />   Today, I only want that you believe this with all you heart and
<br />   speak it with your mouth to others.  
<br /><br />I want to share something with you.
<br />   As many didn‘t invite me to their party, I will have my own celebration, 
<br />   a grandiose party such as no one has ever imagined, a spectacular
<br />   party.
<br /><br />I‘m still making the final arrangements. Today I am sending
<br />   out many invitations and there is an invitation for you. I want to know 
<br />   if you wish to attend and I will make a reservation for
<br />   you and write your name with golden letters in my great guest
<br />   book. Only those on the guest list will be invited to the party. Those 
<br />   who don‘t answer the invitation, will be left outside.
<br /><br />Do you know how you can answer this invitation? it is
<br />   by extending it to others whom you care for... telling them of my love
<br />   and how I want them to be with Me.
<br />   I‘ll be waiting for all of you to attend my party this year... 
<br /><br />See you soon  ....    I love you so much !
<br /><br />~ Jesus~
<br /><br />Remember: Knowing the Bible is one thing.
<br /> Knowing the Author is another!
<br /><br />Spend Time With God Today!

<br /><br />FOUR WORDS
<br />===========
<br /><br />A king called all of his wise men and counselors together for a
<br />meeting.  He addressed them and said, &quot;I want you to go and
<br />think, read, and research.  Consult the wisest and most learned
<br />men in the land.  Spare no expense.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I want you to find the ONE statement that will get me through
<br />all situations in life.  Whether I am on top of the world or in
<br />the pits, find that statement.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I don't want to learn long and complicated philosophies.
<br />I want one simple statement.  Find it or write it; I don't care,
<br />just bring me the statement.&quot;
<br /><br />The men left and consulted for months.
<br />They finally returned and handed the King a scroll.
<br /><br />The King unrolled the scroll.  On it was written four words.
<br /><br />&quot;THIS TOO SHALL PASS&quot;
<br /><br />That was it.
<br /><br />The wise men explained.
<br /><br />When you are on top of the world, that is but a fleeting
<br />moment, things change, always remember, this too shall pass.
<br /><br />When you are in the pits, all nights are followed by day, at
<br />your lowest moments remember also, this too shall pass.
<br /><br />All external circumstances and material things change.
<br /><br />No matter what your circumstances, remember,
<br /><br />THIS TOO SHALL PASS!
<br /><br />The wise men reminded the great King that this would get him
<br />through his earthly things but the truly wise knew there were
<br />things beyond this earth and life. . .
<br /><br />Things that were eternal.
<br /><br />True wisdom they reminded the King was in the ability to
<br />recognize the fleeting temporal things of the material world
<br />from the truly eternal things.
<br /><br />O Great King they said, &quot;Most of the things that you worry or
<br />gloat about are temporary and our four words apply.&quot;
<br /><br />For most of your situations. . .
<br /><br />THIS TOO SHALL PASS!

<br />a discussion online with some friends about Christmas and what
<br />it means... and stores and companies and how they do or do not
<br />celebrate the season! Boy, this really opened my eyes. I don't
<br />know if you will use it, but here it is anyway!
<br /><br />Dear Children,
<br /><br />It has come to my attention that many you are upset that folks
<br />are taking My name out of the season. Maybe you've forgotten
<br />that I wasn't actually born during this time of the year and
<br />that it was some of your predecessors who decided to celebrate
<br />My birthday on what was actually a time of pagan festival.
<br />Although I do appreciate being remembered anytime.
<br /><br />How I personally feel about this celebration can probably be
<br />most easily understood by those of you who have been blessed
<br />with children of your own.
<br /><br />I don't care what you call the day. If you want to celebrate
<br />My birth, just GET ALONG AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
<br /><br />Now, having said that let Me go on. If it bothers you that the
<br />town in which you live doesn't allow a scene depicting My
<br />birth, then just get rid of a couple of Santa's and snowmen
<br />and put in a small Nativity scene on your own front lawn. If
<br />all My followers did that there wouldn't be any need for such
<br />a scene on the town square because there would be many of them
<br />all around town.
<br /><br />Stop worrying about the fact that people are calling the tree
<br />a holiday tree, instead of a Christmas tree. It was I who made
<br />all trees. You can remember Me anytime you see any tree.
<br />Decorate a grape vine if you wish: I actually spoke of that
<br />one in a teaching, explaining who I am in relation to you and
<br />what each of our tasks were. If you have forgotten that one,
<br />look up John 15: 1 - 8.
<br /><br />If you want to give Me a present in remembrance of My birth
<br />here is my wish list. Choose something from it:
<br /><br />1. Instead of writing protest letters objecting to the way My
<br />birthday is being celebrated, write letters of love and hope
<br />to soldiers away from home. They are terribly afraid and
<br />lonely this time of year. I know, they tell Me all the time.
<br /><br />2. Visit someone in a nursing home. You don't have to know
<br />them personally. They just need to know that someone cares
<br />about them.
<br /><br />3. Instead of writing the president complaining about the wording on
<br />the cards his staff sent out this year, why don't you write
<br />and tell him that you'll be praying for him and his family
<br />this year. Then follow up. It will be nice hearing from you
<br />again.
<br /><br />4. Instead of giving your children a lot of gifts you can't
<br />afford and they don't need, spend time with them. Tell them
<br />the story of My birth, and why I came to live with you down
<br />here. Hold them in your arms and remind them that I love
<br />them.
<br /><br />5. Pick someone that has hurt you in the past and forgive him
<br />or her.
<br /><br />6. Did you know that someone in your town will attempt to take
<br />their own life this season because they feel so alone and
<br />hopeless? Since you don't know who that person is, try giving
<br />everyone you meet a warm smile; it could make the difference.
<br /><br />7. Instead of nit picking about what the retailer in your town
<br />calls the holiday, be patient with the people who work there.
<br />Give them a warm smile and a kind word. Even if they aren't
<br />allowed to wish you a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; that doesn't keep you
<br />from wishing them one. Then stop shopping there on Sunday.
<br />If the store didn't make so much money on that day they'd
<br />close and let their employees spend the day at home with their
<br />families.
<br /><br />8. If you really want to make a difference, support a
<br />missionary - especially one who takes My love and Good News to
<br />those who have never heard My name.
<br /><br />9. Here's a good one. There are individuals and whole
<br />families in your town who not only will have no &quot;Christmas&quot;
<br />tree, but neither will they have any presents to give or
<br />receive. If you don't know them, buy some food and a few
<br />gifts and give them to the Salvation Army or some other
<br />charity which believes in Me and they will make the delivery
<br />for you.
<br /><br />10. Finally, if you want to make a statement about your belief
<br />in and loyalty to Me, then behave like a Christian. Don't do
<br />things in secret that you wouldn't do in My presence. Let
<br />people know by your actions that you are one of mine.
<br /><br />Don't forget; I am God and can take care of Myself. Just love
<br />Me and do what I have told you to do. I'll take care of all
<br />the rest.
<br /><br />Check out the list above and get to work; time is short. I'll
<br />help you, but the ball is now in your court. And do have a
<br />most blessed Christmas with all those whom you love and
<br />remember:
<br /><br />I LOVE YOU, JESUS

<br /><br />&quot;Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be [mature]… wanting nothing.&quot; 
<br />                                                                                                   James 1:4
<br /><br />Just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean God has changed His mind. While you are waiting - God is working. The timing may not be right for Him to get the ultimate glory, and you the maximum benefit. That's why the Bible says: &quot;Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect [mature]… wanting nothing.&quot; Impatience is a sign of immaturity. Children can't wait for anything! So, are you being childish or showing maturity? God sets His watch to accomplish His purpose, not ours. Paul writes: &quot;We know that all things work… according to His purpose&quot; (Romans 8:28 paraphrased). When you understand God's purpose you won't permit things that are contrary to it, including hurry and worry. You'll also know how to allocate your time, your energy and your money - who you should spend your life with and who you should not.
<br />God says, &quot;I make known the end from the beginning&quot; (Isaiah 46:10 NIV). First God sets the goal, then He determines the steps that lead to it. And what are we supposed to do while we are waiting? Listen: &quot;Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vine, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Savior&quot; (Habakkuk 3:17 NIV).
<br />Begin thanking God today for what He's done, and what He's going to do on your behalf, because He will - He absolutely will come through for you!
<br /><br />I pray that you will take time to reflect on the sacrifice that 
<br />Jesus made for you to have the chance at eternal Salvation.
<br /><br />Serving the Lord 24/7 
<br /><br />“Others see only a hopeless end, but 
<br />Christians rejoice in an endless hope&quot;

The Holy Bible is my code of conduct. Faith, prayer, and the Word are my weapons of warfare. I have been taught by the Holy Spirit, trained by experience, tried by adversity and tested by fire. I am a volunteer in this army, and I am enlisted for eternity. I will either retire in this army at the Rapture or die in this army; but I will not get out, sell out, be talked out, or pushed out. I am faithful, reliable, capable and dependable. If my God needs me, I am there. If He needs
<br />me in the Sunday school, to teach the children, work with the youth, help adults or just sit and learn, He can use me because I am there! I am a soldier. I am not a baby. I do not need to be pampered, petted, primed up, pumped up, picked up or pepped up. I am a soldier. No one has to call me, remind me, write me, visit me, entice me, or lure me. I am a soldier. I am not a wimp. I am in place, saluting my King, obeying His orders, praising His name, and building His kingdom! No one has to send me flowers, gifts, food, cards, candy or give me handouts. I do not need to be cuddled, cradled, cared for, or catered to. I am committed. I cannot have my feelings hurt bad enough to turn me around. I cannot be discouraged enough to turn me aside. I cannot lose enough to cause me to quit. When Jesus called me into this army, I had nothing. If I end up with nothing, I will still come out ahead. I will win. My God has and will continue to supply all of my needs. I am more than a conqueror. I will always triumph. I can do all things through Christ. Devils cannot defeat me. People cannot disillusion me. Weather cannot weary me. Sickness cannot stop me. Battles cannot beat me. Money
<br />cannot buy me. Governments cannot silence me and hell cannot handle me. I am a soldier. Even death cannot destroy me. For when my commander calls me from this battlefield, He will promote me to Captain and then allow me to rule with Him. I am a soldier in the army, and I'm marching claiming victory. I will not give up. I will not turn around. I am a soldier, marching heaven bound. Here I stand! Will you stand with me?
<br />Guess what? If you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior you're already enlisted! Question is, which part of the service are you in:  
<br />1. Active Duty: Serving the Lord faithfully, daily, and on duty 24-7? 
<br />2. Reserve status: Serving only when called upon or twice a year, Christmas and Easter? 
<br />3. Guard status: Backing up the Active Duty group? or
<br />4. AWOL! Absent without the Lord?
<br />THINK ABOUT IT!!!
