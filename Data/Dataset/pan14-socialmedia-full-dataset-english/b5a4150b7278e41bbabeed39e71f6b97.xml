<br /><br />Alright, so here's what happened. I wanted to get a nice Ralph Lauren polo, but I didn't have enough money to get one. So I started to look online to see if I could find a cheaper one. Then I came across this site called <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.points2shop.com%2F%3Fref%3Duin1315963679"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=uin1315963679</a>. I started to look around this site and I saw that I could get it for free. All I you have to do is complete some offers and then you can spend the points you earn on whatever you want. I know what your thinking. You think that its a scam or a rip-off. That's what I thought at first too. But then I checked out the forums of this site and  then I saw people who posted pics of what they got. So then I completed some offers and then when I got enough points, I ordered my Ralph Lauren. Then after a couple days, I got my shirt. You can get other things to from video games to Ipads to other clothing. You guys should check out this site if you want to earn free stuff. Here's the site again: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.points2shop.com%2F%3Fref%3Duin13159"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=uin13159</a>
