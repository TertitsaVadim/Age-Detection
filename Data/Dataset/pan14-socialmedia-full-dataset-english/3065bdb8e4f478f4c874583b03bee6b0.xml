<br />your views please?
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;Can we have sex right now?
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Because, you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won't tell.&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: looks forward and keeps driving.
<br /><br />5 minutes pass.......
<br /><br />Guy: starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br /><br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me.&quot;.
<br /><br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br /><br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: continues trying.
<br /><br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br /><br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl.he starts to kiss her.
<br /><br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot; Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br /><br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br /><br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br /><br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br /><br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br /><br />An hour passes.........
<br /><br />TinkAnika (8:00:35 PM): Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br /><br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, crying.
<br /><br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody about this. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br /><br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br /><br />2 months later.........
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br /><br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br /><br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the Guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school(which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br /><br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;No means no&quot;
<br /><br />Guys, if this story pisses you off, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this to my girl or any girl

<br /><br />First..get a pen and paper. When you actually choose names, make sure it's people you actually know and go with your first instinct.
<br /><br />Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read ahead or you'll ruin it!
<br /><br />1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column.
<br /><br />2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any two numbers you want.
<br /><br />3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex.
<br /><br />NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON&quot;T TURN OUT RIGHT!
<br /><br />4. Write anyone's name (like friends or family....) in the 4th, 5th,
<br /><br />and 6th spots.
<br /><br />5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11.
<br /><br />GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!!
<br /><br />6. Finally, make a wish.
<br /><br />And now the key for the game.....
<br /><br />1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game.
<br /><br />2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love.
<br /><br />3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out.
<br /><br />4. You care most about the person you put in 4
<br /><br />5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well.
<br /><br />6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star.
<br /><br />7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3.
<br /><br />8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7.
<br /><br />9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind.
<br /><br />10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life
<br /><br />NOW...put this on ur syt within the hour you read this...IF you do..your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the opposite!!

<br /><br />A flicker of a candle,
<br /><br />A movement of a door,
<br /><br />A footstep on the stairs,
<br /><br />A picture falling from the wall,
<br /><br />A light switching off,
<br /><br />A silent phone call,
<br /><br />A distant yet loud whisper,
<br /><br />A shadow in the corner of a room.
<br /><br />I think I know know who this is,
<br /><br />I can smell thier scent from here,
<br /><br />But I can't actually see them,
<br /><br />So what am I supposed to believe?
<br /><br />I feel kind of scared,
<br /><br />But I also feel at ease,
<br /><br />Just give me a more clear sign,
<br /><br />Of who is contacting me.
<br /><br />A quiver of a bush,
<br /><br />A sudden,frantic storm,
<br /><br />A feeling of eyes upon me,
<br /><br />A strange feelin of calm,
<br /><br />A round and shining moon,
<br /><br />A noise of blowing leaves,
<br /><br />A clock striking twelve more than once,
<br /><br />A Weird feeling of fear.
<br /><br />Is this who I think it is?
<br /><br />Or have I got it wrong?
<br /><br />I'm feeling really nervous now,
<br /><br />Please just give me a clue,
<br /><br />I really need to know,
<br /><br />And I think I am right,
<br /><br />After all everything I dream,
<br /><br />Always seems to be right..
