<br />people who want to go to
<br />heaven don't want to die to get
<br />there. And yet death is the
<br />destination we all share. No one
<br />has ever escaped it. And that is
<br />as it should be, because Death is
<br />very likely the single best
<br />invention of Life. It is Life's
<br />change agent. It clears out the
<br />old to make way for the new.
<br />Right now the new is you, but
<br />someday not too long from
<br />now, you will gradually become
<br />the old and be cleared away.
<br />Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is
<br />quite true.

<br />to You today. Say verily my life

<br />calmed and happy, I was
<br />surprised but happy. He's been
<br />out of control for sometime now,
<br />actually since I lost my dad two
<br />years ago. He became the CEO
<br />since my dad died, it was on the
<br />will for my husband to become
<br />the CEO and my baby brother
<br />the Managing director.
<br />I've done everything in my power
<br />to make things right but whatever
<br />I do is not good enough. This
<br />wasn't the same Tayo that I
<br />married. My parents were rich
<br />but their two children were
<br />trained well. I was working in my
<br />dad's company until I had my
<br />second child. My dad told me to
<br />stay at home and take care of the
<br />kids because I refused to get a
<br />maid and my grandma that was
<br />helping passed away at the time.(I
<br />lost my mom five years ago too) I
<br />enjoyed every minute of being a
<br />wife and a mom until I lost my
<br />dad.
<br />My husband came in that fateful
<br />day about three months ago,
<br />looked at me and said &quot;I don't
<br />love you Kemi, I never did. I
<br />appreciate everything you have
<br />done but it is time I move on with
<br />my life. You can stay in this
<br />house, keep the cars and I'll
<br />arrange for monthly allowance
<br />for you and the kids. If your
<br />brother agrees with my lawyer's
<br />terms, I'll pay him generously for
<br />his share in the company. Thanks
<br />to your father, I own the 70% of
<br />the company. Don't try to fight
<br />this, it is clearly written in your
<br />father's will.&quot;
<br />I woke up the following day at
<br />the hospital and by my side was
<br />dad's lawyer, she looked at me
<br />and smiled! Two weeks later, the
<br />lawyer came to see me at home
<br />and to my surprise, she brought
<br />with her a letter handwritten by
<br />my dad. I wish I could hug dad at
<br />that very minute.
<br />There was a clause in the will, if
<br />Tayo leaves me without any fault
<br />of mine or if he dies before me, I
<br />have to take over the company.
<br />Dad knew I could handle it, I've
<br />been working in the company
<br />since my first year in the
<br />university! Tayo came to the
<br />house 2 days after I saw dad's
<br />letter, beggin me to forgive him.
<br />Should she take him back?

<br />dignity will he possess. Whoever
<br />jokes (excessively or indecently) is
<br />a person who will be taken
<br />lightly. Whoever speaks often
<br />errs, the more often 1 errs, the
<br />less modesty he possess; whoever
<br />has a low level of modesty will
<br />also have a low level of piety; and
<br />when 1 has a low level of piety,
<br />then his heart dies.
