Scientists are working hard to produce fuels that burn clean and are safe for the planet. Latest developments have resulted in fuels that not only burn clean but gives an advantage to car owners. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ppbW1pZXR1cm5lcjYxNDY1Mi53ZWJzLmNvbS9hcHBzL2Jsb2cvc2hvdy85NzgyODk3LWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLWZ1ZWxzLWFyZS1oZXJlLWZvci1nb29k" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels: Not A Fad</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ppbW1pZXR1cm5lcjYxNC5saXZlam91cm5hbC5jb20vNTU0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Alternative Fuels Are Here To Stay</a><br /><br />Of all of the alternative fuels, the most well-known is ethanol. Ethanol, also referred to as grain alcohol, is created from either soya or corn. On the market, you can get E85, which is a mixture of 85% ethanol, and 15% gas. Folks who use E85 find that they get better gas mileage and feels that the fuel is burning cleaner than regular gas. E85 still burns clean allthough it contains gasoline. Ethanol can be produced from any organic material such as waste from crops, old paper and the like. As they both are alcohol-based products, methanol is a kind of alternative fuel very much like to ethanol.<br /><br />Methanol can be made out of biomass resources, including wood and coal, and is referred to as wood alcohol. Methanol can be created cheaply from natural gas or propane. Propane, or compressed natural gas, is usual in lots of homes but has been gaining traction for fueling vehicles. Like crude oil, propane is extracted from the earth. Nonetheless, unlike petroleum gas, propane is a gas and not a liquid. Its popularity has grown over the years since propane is an eco-friendly fuel. Another type of fuel that has gained popularity is electricity.<br /><br />Although electric-powered automobiles have been around for yearsmany years, they have become very popular lately. An electric-powered car runs on electrical energy stored in batteries, rather than burning petrol in an engine. It can take anywhere from 12 to 24 batteries to run an electric car. The latest alternative auto fuel is hydrogen, and it is very fascinating as well as promising. Nearly all of the cars using this fuel right now are experimental, but there is a great deal of potential for this energy source, which is rather unique. The advantages of hydrogen are that it is easy to create and it is very light. Many believe that hydrogen will become the next essential fuel for future automobiles.<br /><br />These are merely a few of the several alternative fuels on the market nowadays. More are being developed all the time, and as global warming goes on to cause concern, more alternative fuels will be discovered. As it continues to grow in popularity, every alternative fuel will continue to improve and make the earth a better place.

Ethanol, also referred to as grain alcohol, is prepared from either soybeans or corn. On the market, you can buy E85, which is a mixture of 85% ethanol, and 15% gasoline. Many who use it claim that it burns cleaner that gas and gives better gas mileage. Although there is gas in E85, it still burns a great deal cleaner. Ethanol can be made from any organic material such as waste from crops, discarded paper and the like. Another alternative fuel type that is similar to ethanol is methanol.<br /><br />Methanol is also known as wood alcohol and is made from wood or coal. Now, since it is a lot more inexpensive to make, methanol is made from natural gas or propane. Propane, or compressed natural gas, is usual in lots of households but has been gaining traction for fueling vehicles. Just like petroleum, propane is fuel that can be found underground. Nonetheless, unlike petroleum gas, propane is a gas and not a liquid. As it is such an environmentallyfriendly fuel, natural gas is becoming increasingly popular. One alternative fuel that has been around for many years is old-fashioned electric power.<br /><br />Electric-powered automobiles have been around since the 1970s but have not gained popularity until recently. An electric-powered car runs on electricity stored in batteries, rather than burning gas in an engine. It can take anywhere from 12 to 24 batteries to drive an electric automobile. The latest alternative car fuel is hydrogen, and it is so interesting as well as promising. Hydrogen fuel is nevertheless in its early stages of development but the promise is there. Hydrogen has potential because it is not hard to create and very light to use. It is predicted that hydrogen will be the next big thing for running vehicles.<br /><br />There are several types of alternative sources of fuel, and these were only a few. As people become more afraid of global warming, efforts will be made to develop better alternative fuels. The increasing popularity of alternative fuels will propel the technology to the point where gas will not anymore be a reasonable option.

One alternative fuel that has been with us for a long time is old-fashioned electrical energy.<br /><br />While electric-powered autos have been around for yearsmany years, they have become very popular as of late. An electric automobile uses electrical energy stored in batteries, rather than burning gas in an engine. It can take 12 or 24 batteries to power an electric car. Yet another alternative fuel type that holds a lot of promise is hydrogen. Hydrogen fuel is still in its early stages of growth but the promise is there. The positives of hydrogen are that it is not hard to produce and it is very light. Many people believe that hydrogen will become the next great fuel for future cars.<br /><br />There are a number of types of alternative fuels, and these were only a few. More are being produced all the time, and as global warming keeps causing concern, more alternative fuels will be discovered. As it continues to grow in popularity, each alternative fuel will continue to improve and make the earth a better place.

Ethanol, also referred to as grain alcohol, is created from either soybeans or corn. On the market, you can buy E85, which is a combination of 85% ethanol, and 15% gasoline. Folks who use E85 see that they get better gas mileage and feels that the fuel is burning cleaner than the standard gasoline. Even though there is petrol in E85, it does not emit as much toxins as the typical gas. Ethanol can be produced from any organic material like waste from crops, discarded paper and the like. One other alternative type of fuel that is akin to ethanol is methanol.<br /><br />Methanol is also referred to as wood alcohol and is made from wood or coal. Now, producing methanol is low-cost as it can be made from natural gas or propane. Another alternative fuel has been used in homes for a long time, but nowadays is rising in popularity for automobiles, and that is propane, a compressed natural gas. Similar to oil, propane is taken from the earth. Propane is not a liquid but a true gas identical air. Since it is a very environmentallyfriendly fuel, natural gas is getting popular. Still another fuel type that is widelyy used is electricity.<br /><br />While electric-powered autos have been around for ages, they have become very popular lately. An electric-powered car uses electrical energy stored in batteries, instead of burning gasoline in an engine. It can take 12 or 24 batteries to run an electric automobile. Yet another alternative fuel that seems promising is hydrogen. Majority of the cars using this fuel right now are experimental, but there is a great deal of potential for this energy source, which is kind of unique. Hydrogen has potential since it is easy to create and very light to use. Many people believe that hydrogen will become the next essential fuel for future cars.<br /><br />There are many types of alternative fuel sources, and the ones mentioned were only a few. As individuals become more fearful of global warming, efforts will be made to discover better alternative fuels. The rising popularity of alternative fuels will move the technology to the point where gas will not anymore be a good choice.
