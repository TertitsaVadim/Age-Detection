<br />how could this be you're not here with me
<br />you never said goodbye someone tell me why
<br />did you have to go and leave my world so cold
<br /><br />Everyday I sit and ask myself how did love slip away
<br />something whispers in my ear and says
<br /><br />That you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though you're far away I am here to stay
<br />but you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though we're far apart you're always in my heart
<br />but you are not alone… lone lone why lone
<br /><br />Just the other night I thought I heard you cry
<br />asking me to come and hold you in my arms
<br />I can hear your prayers your burdens I will bear
<br />but first I need your hand then forever can begin
<br /><br />Everyday I sit and ask myself how can love slip away
<br />something whispers in my ear and says
<br /><br />That you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though you're far away I am here to stay
<br />but you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though we're far apart you're always in my heart
<br />and you are not alone oh
<br /><br />Whisper three words and I'll come running
<br />and girl you know that I'll be there I'll be there
<br /><br />You are not alone I am here with you
<br />though you're far away I am here to stay
<br />you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though we're far apart you're always in my heart
<br /><br />But you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though you're far away I am here to stay
<br />And you are not alone I am here with you
<br />though we're far apart you're always in my heart

<br />Through Our Doubts
<br />And Frustrations 
<br />In My Violence
<br />In My Turbulence
<br />Through My Fear
<br />And My Confessions
<br />In My Anguish And My Pain
<br />Through My Joy And My Sorrow
<br />In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow
<br />I'll Never Let You Part
<br />For You Always In My Heart

<br />She knows your game
<br />Look what you're under
<br />It's so insane
<br />Since you seduced her
<br />How does it feel
<br />To know that woman
<br />Is about to kill
<br /><br />Overnight stand is like taking a chance
<br />It's not about love and romance
<br />And now you're gonna get it
<br />Every hot man is out taking a chance
<br />It's not about love and romance
<br />And now you do regret it
<br /><br />To escape the world
<br />I got to enjoy that simple dance
<br />And it seemed that everything was on my side
<br />(Blood on my side)
<br />She seemed sincere
<br />Like it was love and true romance
<br />And now she's got out to get me
<br />But I just can't take it
<br />Just can't break it
<br /><br />Chorus:
<br /><br />Susie got your number
<br />And Susie ain't your friend
<br />Look who took you under
<br />With seven inches in
<br />Blood is on the dancefloor
<br />Blood is on the knife
<br />Susie got your number
<br />And Susie says it's right
<br /><br />She got your number
<br />How does it feel
<br />To know the stranger
<br />It's about to kill
<br />She got your baby
<br />It happened fast
<br />If you could only
<br />Erase the past
<br /><br />Every hot man is out taking a chance
<br />It's not about love and romance
<br />And now you do regret it
<br /><br />Every hot man is out taking a chance

<br />I'm searching for the world that I come from
<br />'Cause I've been looking around
<br />In the lost and found of my heart...
<br />No one understands me
<br />They view it as such strange eccentricities...
<br />'Cause I keep kidding around
<br />Like a child, but pardon me...
<br />People say I'm not okay
<br />'Cause I love such elementary things...
<br />It's been my fate to compensate,
<br />for the Childhood
<br />I've never known...
<br /><br />Have you seen my Childhood?
<br />I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
<br />Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
<br />Of conquest and kings on the throne...
<br /><br />Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
<br />Look within your heart then ask,
<br />Have you seen my Childhood?
<br /><br />People say I'm strange that way
<br />'Cause I love such elementary things,
<br />It's been my fate to compensate,
<br />for the Childhood I've never known...
<br /><br />Have you seen my Childhood?
<br />I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
<br />Like fantastical stories to share
<br />The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
<br /><br />Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
<br />The painful youth I've had
<br /><br />Have you seen my Childhood...

<br />I ain't scared of nobody
<br />Girl when the goin' gets mean
<br /><br />Protection
<br />For gangs, clubs, and nations
<br />causing grief in human relations
<br />It's a turf war on a global scale
<br />I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
<br />See, it's not about races
<br />Just places
<br />Faces
<br />Where your blood comes from
<br />Is were your space is
<br />I've seen the bright get duller
<br />I'm not going to spend my life being a color
