However, not many have the good fortune to realise it within their lifetime.

<br /><br />The exquisitely crafted designer homes &amp; villas at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGxjaGVja2RlYWxzLmNvbS9wcm9qZWN0LXJhaGVqYS1hcmFueWEtY2l0eS1ndXJnYW9uLXNvaG5hLXJvYWQucGhw" target="_blank">Raheja Aranya City</a> are a conneiseur’s delight. Fully loaded with imported floorings &amp; kitchen, private lap pool, natural wooden floorings, air-conditioning, imported sanitaryware, &amp; glass railings, these uber residences are meant only for the chosen few &amp; the retail centre at Aranya -The Green City shall be a one stop destination for your weekend shopping and entertainment needs with a collection of all lifestyle brands and entertainment options under a single roof, being completely mindful of the fact that you would not like to travel far away from your residence for your shopping needs.
<br /><br />The major growth corridor of the area - the upcoming KMPExpressway, is located very close to the site. The Expressway is at an advanced stage of construction and shall soon be operational. Being located on the smooth Gurgaon - Sohna expressway is a major plus in terms of connectivity and accessibility for Raheja Aranya -The Green City, Sohna.
<br /><br />The club - house comes studded with all the delights you desire, from the exotic spa, the soothing steam sauna, state of the art tennis and basketball courts, gymnasium, refreshing jacuzzi, as well as aerobics centre aimed at ensuring a healthy body and mind for you and your near and dear ones.
<br /><br />Also, with the easing of the ceiling on residential plots a few months ago in the NCR, the demand for such projects has witnessed a sharp increase.
<br /><br />This trend seems to be a reaction to the slowdown in the economy and the subsequent dampening of the real estate market that happened in the past few years. The situation forced builders and developers to think of different formats so as to attract all types of buyers.
<br /><br />Delhi has been seeing a wave of residential plots recently. Sapna Kulshrestha studies the shift in trend that is responsible for gradually changing the capital’s skyline.
<br /><br />Typically projects that come under the green purview are those that lay a strong emphasis on the use of environmentally friendly building materials, effective waste management and efficient energy systems. These are designed to substantially reduce or eliminate negative environmental impacts and improve existing unsustainable design, construction and operational practices.
<br /><br />Besides, the construction of plots rather than high-rise buildings was an attractive option for lower and middle-income buyers – as the cost of construction is less for such developments and the benefits can be transferred, making the purchase affordable for them.
