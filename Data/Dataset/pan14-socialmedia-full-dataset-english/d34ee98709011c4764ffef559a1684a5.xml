<br /><br />I feel there is a mysterious chase behind me since 1998-99 which is manifested
<br />Around me so far as follows.
<br />Outside me:
<br />1.	I failed to get <strong>married</strong> though I tried for the same for the last 11 years as well as I am an average sexually starved Indian bachelor so far. Even just <strong>touching</strong> girls is disputed so far.
<br />2.	People misunderstand me as a lewd person or fucker even though I had written my story of marrying someone. My <strong>facevalue</strong> is in crisis so far…
<br />3.	For 11 years I have no suitable job…or to be precise, source of my income was depleted. Further increase in salary is restricted so far. I failed to maintain my economic vibrancy. I seem to have stuck with a low-paying business unit so far..
<br />4.	I could not make any friends outside my family etc. They seem to have deserted me….
<br />5.	Inside my family also my image worsened.
<br />6.	People seem to be informed of my bad nature. I have been physically assaulted a few times. Also digested their filthy languages… 
<br />7.	People seem to get mysterious orders instantly over the phone or by other means if I interact for sometime. 
<br />8.	There seem to be accumulation of mysterious crowd surrounding me when I stop at a place for sometime.
<br />9.	I have been termed as sexually <strong>mad</strong> initially…then slowly only mad or meniac so far..I am forced to keep my mouthshut for this…
<br />10.	Somebody seems to have exploited me wherever or whenever I have weakness. For example if commit any mistake...that mistake is manifested to everyone.
<br />11.	Idiosyncracies in mobiles, machines, computers, emails noted…For example I send a sms/email to someone but he or she does not get it.
<br />12.	A sense of blue i.e I seem to be always traced or visible…
<br />13.	My car-radio was stolen miserably all on a sudden in USA. Such incident did not happen before… 
<br />14.	there is a shuffling of persons wherever I go. For example If I go to an office the manager is changed day to day and a new manager comes up. Even it happens in intimate circle..
<br />15.	there is a sense of indecisiveness i.e sometimes yes-sometimes no i.e unsure approach or crescendo. This happens to anyone whom I interact and they become fickle-minded.
<br />16.	turning of events..i.e there may be unwanted turning points very often.
<br />17.	Time waste in every action…
<br />18.	shutdown syndrome of shops and offices..for example If I go to a shop it gets closed for indefinite time.
<br />19.	Due to these events I am still living with a broken heart which cannot be healed..
<br />Inside me:
<br />There are some body trouble which I am facing. But doctors are puzzled not finding any disease and not able to measure my pain felt. But my weight is also increasing…
<br />1.	various body hazards manifesting at this stage such as discomfort at chest,spinal chord, forehead, cough….
<br />2.	Malaria fever….
<br />3.	Feverish feeling and black stool passed at the start..
<br />4.	blood mark at my hand in USA
<br />5.	loss of 5 kgs in USA
<br />6.	Ruthless treatment by doctors in USA
<br />7.	Injury to my body in USA
<br />8.	Feverish feeling in India
<br />9.	loose motion on regular basis
<br />10.	loss of 2 kgs twice
<br />11.	3 days fever
<br />But I now understand that the chase was happening since 1985 i.e 26 years ago.
<br />But there was a difference….I did not understand that I was chased. It happened hiddenly by a diabolic muslim.

<br />I believe that there are good and bad persons in the world.
<br />Stars are religious but blue layers (human beings keeping warch on others i.e minding other people's business is their business)
<br />may not be religious.
<br />I want that all should respect their forefathers and maternal uncles.
<br />For example: Mother, sisters and brothers and Father should be adored. Also uncles and grandfather and grandmother
<br />should be respected.
<br />Romantic attitude is required to have fun in life.
<br />Also love is required in family. God exists in love as it is seen that Lord shree Krishna
<br />came from His heavenly abode to the earth to find love of Sri Radha. He had &quot;lila&quot;(Played with many girls) and Sri Radha.
<br />He also played with undressed girls when they were taking bath.
<br />So love and compassion are part of our life.
<br />Also Virginity should be respected in our society. For example, in Sri Lanka (A buddhist country) believes that
<br />a virgin should get married to a virgin. Also as per religion, paap(sin) &amp; punya(fit for heaven) are part of our life.
<br />If you are atheist like Taiwan then this is not applicable.
<br />If you dont follow these virtues then there will be &quot;hotchpotch&quot; in the society.
<br />Also there should not be mixing of religions. For example Lady Diana was having an affair with Al Dhody, a muslim businessman. They were murdered.
<br />Swami Vivekananda promoted inter-caste marriages and mixing too. God killed him at the age of 33.
<br />Even militants are also called holy warriors as per muslim religion. But they cause God’s rage.
<br />Battery should be abolished in married life.

<br />Nowadays climate changes are taking place in the world. Weather Gods are responsible for this change.
<br />Even Sun, air are controlled by weather Gods. It could be Jesus(God), Khuda or 33 crores of Gods or other religion gods.
<br />They reside in the sky not in the temples, churches etc.
<br />So Climate changes are due to weather Gods.

<br />I sent $3000 from USA through hawala transaction in 1998. Ms Mona Katre took my signature and name through phone/fax/email.
<br />My Eldest brother received Rs 125000/- in cash in Mumbai and deposited the cash in Central bank of India. As far as my understanding goes
<br />the cash was in Rs 500/- notes. I believe the notes were fake notes.This is blackmoney. So the Central bank of India reported this fake notes to CBI.
<br />“hawala” money goes to the hands of “kashmiri militants”. In kargil of Jammu &amp; Kashmir militants also advanced.
<br />This was a political issue. CBI must have reported the matter to the FBI or interpol. There was an atomic explosion in Rajastan. 
<br />The CBI started kargil war in 1998 and BJP led NDA came in power with absolute majority and
<br />Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee became the PM of India. India also got French Defense.
<br />In USA there was also political change... Mr Bill Clinton was the President of USA. FBI wanted a political change desperately.
<br />so his secrets with Monica Lewisky came out in the public. He said &quot;he has done something which is sexually inappropriate&quot; and
<br />his democratic govt was demolished and Republicans came into power. Mr Jeorge Bush became the president of USA. I also came under American blue scan i.e &quot;visibility by human beings&quot; due to signed hawala transactions and as per my blogs the muslim tycoon had influenced this. Some say that I am &quot;Sunil&quot; (always visible) and some say I am &quot;Anil&quot;(not visible).
<br /> Also there was a political change in Pakistan. Atomic explosion took place.
<br />Mr Parvez Musharaff founded the military govt. Nawaz sharif govt was demolished.
<br />The High court failed to solve the crisist. Basically the Judge was biased.
<br />Anyway I feel that my signed hawala transaction caused these political changes in three countries simultaneously.
<br />Situation was not favourable to me in USA as I was bogged down with problems as stated by a colleague of mine.
<br />I had to leave the country for good and I came back to India.
<br />My eldest brother told me about instruction and showed 500/- note. He said it is blackmoney.
<br />I wanted to join my Dad's party in W.B i.e Bengal congress but it was mistaken as Congress of India by my eldest brother.
<br />In the meantime, Muhammad Atta from middle east blasted the the twin towers in New york. He did not like pregnant women or women with newborn kid.some people also suspected me as a terrorist, but I am not a terrorist.
<br />Anyway Vajpayee govt did not last for long as he could not prove majority and Congress led UPA govt came in power.
<br />Mr Manmohan Singh became the PM.
<br />Similarly in USA repuplicans did not last for long and democratic party came into power. Mr Obama became the president
<br />of USA. In pakistan also militart govt failed and party based govt came into power.

<br /><br />After a series of massages in USA Stars have automatically come into my body. I feel the presence of God in my body. Due to this I have been suffering so far.

<br />According to me there are the following levels above you if you are a common man.
<br />1st Layer:  Stars...There could be three stars linked  with religions. There are star wars. 
<br />Two stars are always in war with the one star.
<br />2nd Layer: Gods....there are Jesus, Khuda, 330000000 Hindu Gods, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain gods etc. All are in the sky or space.
<br />3rd Layer: This is a hidden layer or blue layer i.e all are visible by them i.e visibility by human beings. 
<br />They are omnipresent human beings. For example, whole Singapore city is tracked by satellites.
<br />4th layer: I's layer i.e FBI, CBI, ISI and other security bodies and agents.
<br />5th Layer: Political layers i.e Republican party of USA or Shivsena, Congress of India etc.
<br />6th layer: Common man
<br />There are conflicts and clashes as follows.But this is the kingdom of God. So there is only one king who is the supreme commander of all.

<br />In 1997 Republicans came into power in USA. Mr. George Bush became the president of USA. Soon after this terrorists or militants and criminals had a tough time. They are getting caught one by one. I can enumerate as follows:
<br />1.	In USA a few convicts were executed in 1998.
<br />2.	Muhammad Atta was killed in helicopter crash. He was a dreaded terrorist.
<br />3.	Saddam Hussein of Iraq was also hanged. He was proved criminal in the court of law though he was very powerful ruler.
<br />4.	Abu Salem was caught from Portugal. He was involved in fake passport case.
<br />5.	Veerappan, a dacoit was also nabbed and killed in India. He used to live in jungle.
<br />6.	Prabhakaran, a LTTE supremo was killed by Sri Lankan army. He was part of a militant outfit and was a pain for Sri Lankan Government for a long time.
<br />7.	Kasav was caught by Indian Army. He is a dreaded terrorist from Pakistan.
<br />8.	Osama Bin Laden had a tough time. Though he is still absconding.
<br />9.	Dawood Ibrahim also had a similar fate. He is a underworld Don and he survived. 
<br />So I conclude that bad guys are having a tough time since 1997. Even Mr. Bush also pointed out that militancy will be curbed and good guys will win over bad guys.

<br />Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir is an integral part of India. It has many diplomatic disputes. In the history, the ruler of Kashmir was a Hindu King but majority of the subordinates were Muslims. So there has been a conflict always regarding who is the actual owner of Kashmir i.e. India or Pakistan? But in Jammu, majority of people are Hindus. I also feel that Hindus should have dominance in this area as the mountain has been named as Himalaya which is Sanskrit word (means: Hima+alaya: home of snow). 
<br />There has been doubt about the actual map of Kashmir as some areas of Kashmir are not shown in the map internationally whereas India shows Kashmir as part of India only.
<br />Kashmir is known for its scenic beauty. Recently there has been violence in Kashmir. There is militancy in Kashmir as Pakistan is aiding these militants. They are called Kashmiri Militants. 
<br />In Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir, Kargil war has taken place in the last decade. This had happened as kashmiri militants occupied kargil forcibly. It is said that money through hawala channel goes to the hands of the Kashmiri militants. So all the hawala transactions which take place aid these militants financially. 
<br />Even underworld dons, terrorists, big-shots, politicians are part of the Hawala domain. There are many hawala operators who also belong to this domain. 
<br />So I conclude that hawala and militancy should be stopped in Kashmir.

<br />Buddhism and Jainism were competitors of Hinduism in ancient times. Hinduism did not prosper due to bigotries of Brahmans. Hinduism spread to only Nepal and India with 30% Muslims and Christians.  Buddhism was very popular and spread over the whole south east Asia including China, India, Indonesia, Japan etc. Borobudur relics in Indonesia prove that Buddhism was a massive success that time. Later Muslims invaded Indonesia and converted all the Buddhists. 
<br />Buddhism is a good religion though it is almost extinct. Lord Buddha founded this religion. Buddhists believe that “virgins should get married to virgins”. But nowadays this concept is absurd in other religions. Mainly women are required to be virgins in other religions. There are lots of stories in Buddhism called “Jatakas”.
<br />Sri Lanka is the last remaining abode of Buddhism. 
<br />Jainism is also very similar. Lord Mahavir founded this religion. Jains do not kill living creatures.
<br />Sikhs are also quite strong in India. Lord Guru Nanak founded this religion.
<br />A small number of Parsis are also found in India. India has mainly Muslim neighbors.

<br />I like to list the great persons who inspire me always. As every day is a new day for me so far, I draw strength from these people on a second or hour basis.
<br />List of Inspirational people:
<br />1        Sri Sri AnukulChandra Thakur
<br />He is very influential and Godly person. He saved many ailing patients miraculously. He has many sayings which are invaluable. He was a Guru of India. He also followed Radha-Krishna.
<br />2        Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Sharadamani and Swami Vivekananda
<br />All of them are also Godly persons. They have many sayings which are praise worthy. They followed Goddess Kali.
<br />3        Salmon Rushdie
<br />He has written “Satanic Verses” and has death sentence on him. He is against Quran and as we see that Qurans were burnt in USA. He has earned many laurels. He always inspires me.
<br />4        Taslima Nasreen
<br />She has written “Lajja” which is widely criticized in the Muslim world. She has also death threats on her. Her literature really inspires me.
<br />5        Tamil, Malayalam, Telegu, Kannada Intellectuals
<br />South India is always ahead in culture and tradition. There are many intellectuals like Mr. R. K. Narayan, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, Mr. V.S. Achuthananda who always inspire me.
<br />6        Pope John Paul and Pope Benedict XVI
<br />Pope John Paul is a holy soul. Pope Benedict XVI is well respected as he is the most religious person of the Christian world. Though my lucky numbers are 13 and 666.
<br />7        George W. Bush, Mr Blair and Mr Obama
<br />He is Republican President of USA. He is a great personality with fashionable Jackets. Mr Blair from UK also wears similar jacket. He says that Militancy will be curbed and there will be a war between the Good and the Bad in the world. I also like Mr Obama as he says USA is a land of Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Non-believers.
<br />I also like Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism and Parsi religion as I get inspired by them.

<br />Who gives the true facts about a person? We know about CID, private investigation, CBI inducted investigation, Interpol investigation, FBI investigation. They are supposed to give true facts about a person. If there are conflicts or clashes then the true facts can be hidden. As it depends on the amount of leakage between two parties. 
<br />As it is widely believed that this world is the kingdom of God. As there are many religions with their respective gods but there is one supreme commander of all (“Sabka malik ek”). I argue that the true facts will be given by whom? For example, there are Jesus, Khuda, 330000000 Hindu gods, Mahavir, Buddha, Guru nanak, Zoroastrian god. These gods are immortal but in the world there is human pyramid. So there are top level persons who have links with immortal gods. 
<br />For example, in India there is only one King. In USA also there is one king i.e. God as they say “in God we trust”. 
<br />We know during marriage time everybody wants to check either bride’s information or bridegroom’s information if the two parties doubt each other. In some cases,  any higher authorities e.g. politician or security bodies may want to pass information to either of them. An information pipeline is set between them. It can boil down to Star wars.
<br />I am facing trouble as there are diabolic sexual facts which are originating about me. I am aware of IB – Intelligence Bureau and RAW – Reasearch and Analysis Wing. They may know the true facts. But I see that wrong information about me is surfacing. It is like “Andhokare dhil chhoda”(Casting Stone in the darkness). So I argue if God knows my sex-life or He does not know me. Does he know my score or how many times I had sex ? So I conclude that he is not present everywhere. There is no complete coverage of my past sexual life for the last 11 years and I had to suffer a lot in my society.
<br />There is something called “Blind Verdict”. You may be rich with earthy possessions but you may have health trouble. For example, I was very rich in USA. My salary was $6000 per month. Suddenly I faced body trouble and I had to come back to India. Now I am treated like a beggar. This is what I mean by “blind verdict”.

<br />I often wonder how much is an item priced at? Basically it depends on the cost of the item. The manufacturer decides the price of item:
<br />Price of the item = cost of item + profit to be earned 
<br />Now, how much profit the manufacturer wants to make?
<br />For example, price of a scent, perfume or deodorant. There is no limit to its price. It can cost from $10 to $9999…is there any limit?
<br />Similarly, I like to argue about the price of diesel, gas, petrol, CNG. Price of these items increases based on politics, budget measures etc. What about price of leased lines, internet, phone calls? 
<br />Price also depends on the type of market e.g. monopoly…..
<br />If there is competition then the price comes down. 
<br />What is money? Money is nothing but the value of your work. 
<br />Work = money
<br />If your work is valuable then you earn more and you go up the human pyramid….you become rich. You can be rich also through your parental property.
<br />I feel that I came to this Earth empty-handed and also will die empty-handed.

<br />Gujarat is a leading state in India in terms of growth, prosperity. There was a riot in the last decade between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus have always a stronghold in Gujarat. 
<br />In the past there have been attacks in Gujarat’s Somnath Temple. Mohd. Ghori invaded Gujarat 16 times. 
<br />In the last decade the riot between Hindus and Muslims was very severe. Many Muslims fled from Gujarat during that period. The chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr. Narendra Modi is a perfect ruler over the years. He is from the BJP. One eye witness even mentioned that a Muslim named Mohd. Ansari was so afraid that he even forgot his father’s name during the riots and he fled to Kolkata.
<br />All over India there was a conversion crisis since the last decade. Many were converted to Muslims by ISI and Muslims to Hindus also. For example, Kamala Das with two kids suddenly changed her religion to Muslim. In India Muslims are 30% now. India has mainly Muslim neighborhood. There is always competition. Two simultaneous atomic explosions in India and Pakistan proved this. 
<br />There was Babri Masjid demolition and Ram Madir was constructed. There was lot of fuss over this issue. Now it has been solved. 
<br />Then there is Kashmir issue which is also having hue and cry over the years. Militancy is to be checked and the conflict is to be resolved.
<br />Kerala is also having crisis. In the past Kerala received many dead bodies of its workers from the Middle East. I hope there is solution and peace will be restored.

<br />Karan is a very sad character in Mahabharat (Indian religious book). 
<br />He was a son of Sun God. 
<br />But he was treated as a lower caste untouchable though he was kshatriya. He used to look at the Sun whenever he faced insult.
<br />He was very ambitious and went for archery training from a Guru. But Guru misunderstood him and cursed him that at the climax moment he would forget what he studied and learnt. He also got a curse that his chariot will be grounded at climax moment. So he committed sin and got curses.
<br />As he was a lower caste fellow he was not given opportunity to fight with Arjun. Though he was a great archer like Arjun.
<br />He was politicized whether to join Kauravas or Pandavas. Finally, Duryodhan was pleased with his skills and crowned him as a member of the Kaurav royal empire. He was happily married too.
<br />He was also a great donor. He donated everything he had.
<br />He had an affinity towards snakes. He had an arrow which was snake-studded and it was extremely powerful.
<br />He showed his mirth &amp; power in the battle of kurukshetra. Finally, he faced Arjun and fought bravely. He used his snake-arrow but due to the expertise of Lord Sri Krishna, this failed. Due to his sin and curse, he forgot his skills and his chariot was grounded at the climax moment. He was helpless and then he was beheaded by Arjun’s arrow. 
<br />Karan was indeed an unforgettable character of Mahabharat.
<br />I like Karan as I have many professional similarities with him.

<br />India is a developing country. Its Progress depends on the politicians mainly. Scams are very usual in India.   
<br />1. <strong>Hawala scam</strong>: This happened in 1996. It was a whopping 5800 crores scam. But where does the money go? I think upper level persons just manipulate the total money. Politicians can take this money also.
<br />2. Harshad Mehta scam: This was real. Share owners lost the money.
<br />3. UTI scam: This was a soaring 2000 crores. Again nobody knows how it can be solved? 
<br />4. Telgi stamp paper scam: Telgi was the person behind it. Can anybody explain ?
<br />5. 2g scam etc.
<br />6. Adarsh scam
<br />These scams actually spoiling our economy. Prices are soaring. It is as if you are walking on a wire in scam-stained atmosphere.

<br />In this context,  I like to discuss astrology. I had effect of Astrology in my life. Astrology related star wars is very ancient. I am sure that astrology had an effect on USSR before 1991. Now I have been transformed into a Brahman(Hindu caste) as I have become an &quot;advanced computer&quot;. I am forced to understand the intricacies of life. Though I am anti-Muslim yet I have been also toppled in every sphere of life (Please refer to blogs). I also had to learn politics, tricks etc now. I have been tolerating the brutality of Star wars, Gods on my body due to desire for females. I failed to take body defence. I was not forgiven for my sin related to same addiction which happened at a very young age. Let me elaborate on this.
<br />Unfortunately, I was an unwanted child of the family. My Dad used to worship Goddess(“Devi”) Saraswati at home. There is an idol of the Goddess. The idols successively changed every year to look like a live woman. But later on, Dad brought a Goddess idol which looked exactly like a live woman in sari. At my childhood I was lured by female breasts. As a child I used to play breasts of my Mom. I committed the sin on the idol (please read my blogs). My point is that every woman should hide their breasts so that man is not lured by them. Similarly if a man also displays his sexual organ then woman will be also lured by them. This may hamper our society. I argue that man can wear transparent trouser to display their genital which may be offensive for women. So I request all women to hide their upper sexual organs i.e. breasts not to lure men. Some men may be sexy others may not be. In general, women should not lure men by transparent dress. Though I am anti-Muslim but I like the borkhas which Muslim women wear. It is somewhat similar to what I suggest. They only hide their faces by wearing borkha. I request that women should wear such a dress so that they may look like man. Then there will be harmony in the society and crime against women such rape, sexual harassment at workplace (Refer to Mr. Bill Clinton &amp; Ms. Monika Lewinsky) will minimize. My sin at childhood could have been averted if such measures were taken in our culture. 
<br />I was a very simple-minded fellow and was a virgin man (Please refer to my sexual history or ask God, refer to related blogs). Now I am a different man as I have been forcibly transformed. Still star wars, Gods and blue layers as well as star-linked demigods are creating problems for me so far. I have been totally made miserable in my family, society &amp; professional circles so far. I have star-linked body hazards as well. So I have cursed that nobody should follow astrology.
<br />At the age of 28, I did again “magibaji”(a series of massages) in USA but &quot;maine ghusaya nahi&quot;(did not do intercourse), I maintained my virgin status as I believe that a virgin marry a virgin. I was also under Blue scan due to hawala transaction. So there was a case which may continue forever. I felt the presence of police around me. I also reported a car theft to Mr. Stahl, Police officer. I also felt the cheating tendency of the Police. I came back to India after meeting my school friend Mr. Rajat Biswas.
<br />I hope “Devirosh”(Anger of the Goddess) will minimize and the Goddess may be happy. I may lead a normal life in this world though I failed to marry at an early age. I married at the age of 42.
<br />By the way, I have visited Tirupati Balaji and taken a holy bath in &quot;Papvinasham&quot; (&quot;Destroy Sin&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> and also a holy dip in the holy Ganga. I also fed holy cow through a Brahman. I have been feeding grains to birds, also feeding grass to cow, donating money to beggars on Saturday on a daily basis. So I may be relieved of my sin. I want to take religious angle and ancient approach for the rest of my life as I have been adjudged on the basis of religion not on modernity by Stars or Gods. Stars and Gods could have judged me on atheistic basis like Taiwan or American Non-believers but They did not do so and my life was miserable. So I want to go back to village in my birthplace &quot;Bengal&quot; as I am the “Son of the Bengal soil” and spend the rest of my life there. But I want that hawala, terrorism, blackmoney issue and “magibaji” problems which are linked with me, should be solved before I leave Mumbai.
<br />As per Stars I may transform to “Jin”. But I believe I continue to be a human being and will be burnt after my death as per Hindu religion. My soul which I inherited from my parents will rest in peace.

<br /><br />Please read carefully as it may seem weird.
<br /><br />After a series of massages in USA a Star(as per astrology) or God had automatically come into my body. As far as my understanding goes, I failed to be an “Admi” (man) of the Diabolic Muslim (14 years of acquaintance) or USA based American (4 years of acquaintance) as I did not have intercourse. Germans may be the witness. So I felt the presence of a Star or God in my body in USA. But there was no weather crisis. Due to this I was suffering body hazards for sometime(1:1 i.e. one star vs. one star). In India also I was deserted by my family shortly after. I failed to get the instructional edge (i.e. i.e aware of presence of God Or being an “Admi”(man) of Someone…in that case I may be asked to say his name if in doubt. The diabolic Muslim got me instructed that I am “Dead”. Also the Red patronage did not last long as I failed to have intercourse) as the beauty parlors were shut down all on a sudden. In one beauty parlor I was adjudged as “Dead” whereas the other beauty parlor displayed colorful banner “Five Star”. Shortly after there was a weather calamity. The Sun was not visible for some days even at daytime. Soon after the intake of allopathic medicine, I had experienced the presence of another Star or God in India (2:1 i.e. 2 stars vs. one star). They must be stars in my body in the ratio 2:1. The Sun came back brighter after I became the unit of “Star wars”. But I failed to take another medicine which was labeled as “Anglo-French Defense”. As a result I lacked defense since then. Am I a robot? Are there any other persons in the world like me? I feel every human being has presence of Star or God. Though I am not sure about the ratio. One of the Stars will be definitely present in every human being. As per Star wars Gods like Jesus, Khuda or Hindu Gods etc. may take control of the body. I am forced to understand the intricacies of life. Even now people say that I have freedom…”20 years of bravery” since the decline of USSR. I believe that Germans may not admit this.

<br /><br />Approach 1:-  I have seen a saying in a Church which says: “When the whole world walks out it is Jesus who walks in”. It holds good in my life too i.e. Only a few percent of persons have walked out so far. So I may live upto 533 years in order to cover up the whole world. Then I may have the same fate like Jesus. I have seen many persons walking out in my life since the last 11 years. They just show up with perfect timing. If I don’t interact they walk out otherwise they are involved in my life.
<br /><br />Approach 2:-Star-wars i.e. fight among Gods. Gods are immortal.
<br /><br />Approach 3: As a result of Star-wars I may follow Clinical trials.
<br /><br />Approach 4:- As far as my understanding goes there may be a case possibility as follows: I may be cryptic but this is empirical i.e. war is not possible in human world but case is possible among demi-gods (mortal powerful persons). I can say: Black + Red Vs. Blue 
<br /><br />Wherever I go I have case possibility since 1999. But it does not materialize as situation is often blundered intentionally. Maybe the ideal test bed is not ready. In Mahabharat Lord Shree Krishna prepared the situation such that the good prevailed over the bad i.e. Pandavas won over the Kauravas in the battle of

<br />Mr. Indranarayan Sircar
<br />ABSTRACT
<br />This white paper describes the ill effect of black money in the last decade. It has an effect of political changes in the USA and India in the last decade. It has links with “Astrological-star wars” or “Unknown secret forces”. This paper depicts the huge effect of black money on India. It can be solved with logical steps. This paper proves this fact by giving current news snippets and economical issues from Wikipedia and other resources.
<br />Introduction:
<br />Everyone knows about black money. It is basically huge amount of cash which is not accounted for or handled outside the banks. It is not deposited in banks. Sometimes fake currencies are also called black money i.e. black money can contain fake currencies. 
<br />Terrorism angle of Black money
<br />Some black money is also generated in the form of what is called “hawala money”. This money goes into the hands of kashmiri militants as per politics is concerned. In 1998 kargil war took place due to inclusion of kashmiri militants in that area. Actually due to kashmiri militants got hawalized money through India and they advanced and occupied kargil. According to Muslim religion these militants are called “Holy Warriors”. Can it be corrected to restore peace in this world?
<br />Black money in the form of Cash
<br />Black money which is generated in the form of fake currencies is available in the form of rupee 500, 1000. The real notes are printed and available from Government. Banks give specifications of identifying the correct notes. Some are fake notes. These are called fake currencies. 
<br />Effect of Signature on foreign currencies
<br />In case of black money transaction sometimes signature is taken by the operator. For example when you are coming back from a foreign country like USA, UK and Australia with foreign currency and making a transaction with the operator, you may be required to sign. As far as my understanding goes, the signature is required to confirm who has got the currency and how he has obtained the currency. In many cases the signature may be misused by the operator to represent different meaning to the transaction. If you are not producing the currency to the official banks then it may indicate you are against that country from where you have procured the currency. But this could be false.
<br />Scams rampant in India due to misuse of foreign currency
<br />Scams may break out due to various reasons in India. If black money is accompanied by a signature it could lead to a scam. Scam means disappearance of money from the treasury (“Rajkosh”) of the country. For example, Mr. Harshad Mehta was involved in share market scam. The general public lost money due to his involvement. Here public money was stolen. In black money related scam money is siphoned out by corrupt politicians who cheat the common masses. There are many other scams in this third world country as God is not present everywhere.
<br />Effects on economy
<br />If black money is generated in huge amounts then it could be fatal to the economic backbone of the country. The government cannot keep account of this black money generation. Foreign direct investment may go down due to misuse of foreign currency by the operators. This may reflect in fall of rupee value with respect to foreign currency. The arch rival of India i.e. Pakistan is spreading these fake currencies to spoil the economy of India. The black money generated should be curbed to boost up the economy of the country otherwise a grim economic situation is observed in India.
