		<document id="ebb55626862bd60aab5941c3099054a6" url=""><![CDATA[Lets beat racism, the i_is stylie ways lol<br/><br/>Why should we all be too careful in what we say,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  after all the first thing that pops up into our heads enters there instantly without alot of effort in thinking about it,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  must we then sive out things that we may of been told not to say, thus suppressing peoples true first thoughts,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  I my self think we are all becoming boring and worried about what you might say may offend, relax and say the first thing that enters your mind WITHIN reason lol.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />If someone calls me ugly, or a green faced gonk or anything made to try and ofend me, ill say &quot;issit lol <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> so what,&quot; and so long as you are not touched or hit as in assaulted, then why be hurt for words, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> if someone hits you then you have the right to hit back, the same principle should apply for words put to you, rather give a word back just as you would if you was asulted, if I was black and someone called me a name like you pakiman, ill say yes that’s where I come from Pakistan with a smile though, if someone calls me a yellow man I say so what your a white man and/or black or brown, why cant we call each other names and make fun rather than bring in this thing called racist its bollox, it just makes peoples lives boring and having to be careful what you say ffs, seems people have taken the use of fun and turned it into a tool for gaining some type of help and all cos they cant find a word to give back, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> I think the only help should be to enlighten the persons whom took it as a tool and rather teach them how to understand the humour in us all and when I say us I mean us people in all countries of the globe.
<br /><br />If you saw a blue person whom had three heads, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> would you look and stare at him/her and probably make a comment in your own head i think yes we all would, some funny thoughts, some horrid and some loving maybe, out of 10 million people how many comments would be made differently from each different race  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> untold i bet.
<br /><br />Keep your comments to your self, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> WoW now that would be fun wouldn’t it. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Sorry for having a brain that can think in many ways and not just one track  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> and sorry for having ears that can hear the remarks made,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> and sorry for seeing a blue three headed person, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> and finally sorry for being alive to make this remark.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />
