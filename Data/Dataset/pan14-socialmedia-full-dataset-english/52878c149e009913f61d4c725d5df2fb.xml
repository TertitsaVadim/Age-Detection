<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_16448865_47613266.jpg" />
<br /><br />Hair extensions can be created from several types of hair including human hair, synthetic hair or a mixture of both.</strong>
<br /><br />When selecting hair extensions, you will need to choose from human hair, synthetic hair or a combination of the two. By understanding the benefits of each type of hair, you will be able to pick the right hair extensions for you.
<br /><strong>
<br />Human-hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />Whether you want hair extensions to help disguise <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS8_" target="_blank">hair loss</a>, add volume to thinning hair or just make a fashion statement, most experts recommend hair extensions created from natural human hair. Human-hair extensions can be washed, colored, styled and otherwise treated like your own hair. Of course, since they are made of human hair, these hair extensions look more authentic than synthetic extensions do.
<br /><br />&quot;We use real 100 percent human hair,&quot; says Giovanni Mele, owner of Giovanni &amp; Pileggi salon in Philadelphia. &quot;Most reputable salons use human hair because it looks and feels more realistic and is easier to maintain and care for. Synthetic-hair extensions also are an option but are more limiting in what you can do with them.&quot;
<br /><br />The hair for human-hair extensions comes from all around the world. New York City trichologist Elizabeth Cunnane Phillips says, &quot;The most common type of human hair used in extensions tends to be European, followed by Indian and Asian.&quot;
<br /><br />European hair is thin and shinny, making it a top choice for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUV4dGVuc2lvbnMv" target="_blank">hair extensions</a>. Asian hair can sometimes be too thick, so it is processed and thinned out using chemicals that can damage the hair, resulting in lower-quality extensions. Indian hair is usually similar in structure to the hair from Europe and therefore a popular option.
<br /><br />&quot;Remy hair is the most often used and is the highest-quality hair,&quot; says Ron King, L'Oreal Professionnel stylist and spokesman and creator of Ron King Invisi-Tab Hair Extensions. &quot;Remy hair still has the cuticle layer that all flows in the same direction as natural hair would.&quot;
<br /><br />Remy hair is often considered the best quality for hair extensions because the cuticles are not stripped. With other types of hair, an acid bath is used, which strips the hair cuticles, and then a layer of silicone is added to give the hair a shiny, smooth look. But the silicone eventually wears off when the hair is washed, causing the hair extensions to get dull, matted and tangled. Preserving the cuticles in Remy hair allows the manufacturer to create beautiful, natural-looking hair extensions that are extremely shiny, silky and soft -- as well as tangle free. Although Remy hair can be found in a variety of places around the globe, Indian Remy hair is the most popular.
<br /><br /><strong>Synthetic-hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />In recent years, some concerns have developed about how the human hair in hair extensions is being procured. Horror stories exist about hair being harvested from corpses, young girls in Russia being forced to shave their heads and women in India not knowing their sacrificed hair is being sold by Hindu temples to be used for extensions. Because some of these stories are actually fact and not fiction, the ethics of hair extensions have been called into question.
<br /><br />While many hair extension distributors and manufacturers have developed ethics policies, reportedly only about 25 percent of hair imported into the United States for hair extensions is considered ethical. Because the origins of most hair extensions are untraceable, the only way you can be assured that ethical hair extensions are being attached to your head is by purchasing synthetic-hair extensions.
<br /><br />Synthetic-hair extensions have come a long way over the past decade. Created from synthetic (man-made) fibers, synthetic-hair extensions are far less expensive than their human-hair counterparts. Keep in mind, however, that maintenance costs will be pricier. Synthetic hair can be burned with heated styling tools and can tangle easily if not cared for properly.
<br /><br />For a period of time, some hair extension companies were making hair extensions out of a mix of both human and synthetic hair. Unfortunately, this was not a wise option, since the different hair types demand different care and treatment.
<br /><br />In most cases, to get a realistic, full head of extensions, you should stick with high-quality, ethical human hair. For hairpieces or short-term wear, synthetic hair can look authentic and be a more affordable option.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_8411823_47613618.jpg" />
<br /><br /><strong>Medications, scalp treatments, massage and laser hair therapies are used to halt and sometimes reverse hair loss. But the causes of hair loss are different from one person to the next -- remedies need to be approached individually and holistically.</strong>
<br /><br />If you see increasing amounts of hair in the shower drain on a daily basis or are finding you can no longer style your hair the way you wish, this may be due to a progressive and potentially permanent loss of hair. Perhaps you already pay closer attention to advertising for hair regrowth products and therapies (of which there is no shortage). Naturally, you will wonder why there are so many different products and whether they can live up to their claims.
<br /><br />Following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlZ3Jvd3RoLVRoZXJhcHkv" target="_blank">hair regrowth therapy</a>. We hope this helps you to see if and how you can stop your own hair loss and perhaps regain some of the hair you thought was gone.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Which hair loss conditions are progressive and irreversible?</strong>
<br /><br />The most common form of progressive and irreversible hair loss is androgenic alopecia (also called androgenetic alopecia). For men this is male pattern baldness (MPB ), seen in a receding hjavascript://airline on the forehead and thinning at the crown. For women, female pattern baldness is a generalized thinning with no distinct pattern. For men and women with this condition, catching the problem early yields the greatest success in stopping its progression. In many men, the loss begins in their early 20s and by age 60 about two-thirds have noticeable MPB. Women may have thin hair from childhood that gets progressively worse with time, or it may be a result of a thyroid disorder or a postpartum or postmenopausal condition that occurs in adulthood.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Which hair loss conditions are temporary, reversible naturally or with effort?</strong>
<br /><br />Factors that disrupt the hormonal system, reduce nutrient absorption or cause psychological stress tend to cause temporary hair loss. These include thyroid conditions, postpartum hair loss and loss due to malnutrition (hyperlow caloric intake, as in anorexia or bulimia, imbalanced diets or dire economic conditions). Traction alopecia -- the pulling of hair caused by tight styling -- and CCCA (central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia: hair loss due to chemical and heated styling treatments) can also lead to temporary or permanent hair loss. In cases of trichotillomania, the individual has an uncontrollable urge to pull out his or her own hair, which is most effectively addressed with counseling.
<br /><br />Patients with alopecia areata (bald patches), alopecia totalis (complete hair loss on the scalp) and alopecia universalis (total loss of hair on the head and body) suffer from these conditions in both genders across a spectrum of age. Efforts to address each of these are best made under the supervision of a board-certified medical doctor, quite often a dermatologist.
<br /><br />As should be clear, each of these comes with an important caveat: All individuals are unique, and how their hair responds to changing medical, environmental or psychological stress is unique as well. Qualified, licensed hair loss specialists should be able to provide an individualized analysis and treatment program, including the recommendation to see a medical doctor if the condition appears to be outside their purview.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: What are the most-used hair regrowth therapy strategies?</strong>
<br /><br />The two FDA-approved treatments for male pattern baldness are minoxidil (Rogaine and other brand names) and finasteride (Propecia), which are by far the most-used approaches to halting male hair loss. Rogaine for women is used also to some effectiveness; however, Propecia is strictly forbidden for women because it can cause birth defects, and it is found to largely be ineffective in postmenopausal women. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9MYXNlci1IYWlyLVRoZXJhcHkv" target="_blank">Laser hair therapy</a> is also commonly used. Scalp treatments, shampoos and nutrition supplements, although lacking efficacy data or known outright to be ineffective, are sold worldwide.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Which hair regrowth therapies are the least invasive?</strong>
<br /><br />The most invasive therapy, short of hair transplants, is Propecia, a prescription medication taken internally. According to a report summarizing multiple studies on Propecia that was published by the American Academy of Family Physicians (&quot;Medical Treatments for Balding in Men,&quot; Dean Thomas Scow et al., April 15, 1999), about 3.8 percent of men experienced sexual side effects: decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate or erectile dysfunction, as well as breast enlargement and tenderness. That report also found that finasteride alters prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, a standard diagnostic for identifying prostate cancer.
<br /><br />A more recent survey, of 71 men aged 21 to 46, conducted at George Washington University found indications of something more worrisome. The study author states that 94 percent of participants reported lower libido as a result of taking finasteride. The same number reported decreased erectile dysfunction, while 69 percent claimed problems with orgasm. Participants' pre-finasteride level of sexual activity was 26 episodes per month, and on average declined to eight episodes per month after taking finasteride. Some of these effects lasted five years, including a year or more after discontinuing the medication.
<br /><br />Other on-label warnings are that finasteride (the generic name for Propecia) can lead to &quot;severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); breast enlargement, lumps, pain, or tenderness; depression; nipple discharge; testicular pain.&quot;
<br /><br />Minoxidil (Rogaine) is used in pill form in higher doses to treat high blood pressure. This is not recommended for hair loss, since it can have many side effects, including chest pain, swelling and rapid weight gain (among other adverse effects). If applied topically in lower dosages for hair loss, it may cause scalp irritation but is far less invasive.
<br /><br />Laser therapy stimulates blood flow to the scalp and is ruled safe by the FDA (note: the FDA rules on safety only, not efficacy). Scalp treatments and shampoos also are considered noninvasive and at worst might cause irritation to the skin in some individuals.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: What kind of success can a person expect from hair regrowth therapy?</strong>
<br /><br />By and large, the person who addresses hair loss early will see the best results. As a rule, hair loss treatments of all kinds are most effective at halting progression of the loss, less so at restoring growth in hair that is already lost. In some cases, the therapy can increase hair shaft thickness, creating fuller hair without restoring follicles that have expired.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: How much does it cost to try to regrow your hair with laser therapy?</strong>
<br /><br />Laser hair treatments require a committed approach, often two 20-minute sessions per week for a year. Depending on where you live, costs range between $2,000 and $6,000 for a full year's treatment, with additional expenses related to scalp massage treatments and products and special shampoos.
<br /><br />Costs for Propecia and Rogaine also vary. At least one online retailer advertises Propecia at $60 for a one-month supply, and another offers Rogaine at $20 for a three-month supply (generic and competing brands for minoxidil help reduce the price of this topical treatment).
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Would laser therapy cause trauma or risk other side effects?</strong>
<br /><br />Because the FDA has reviewed the laser therapy technology, the treatment is certified as safe. It is applied gradually, typically in twice-weekly treatments, which enables patients and technicians to identify if there are any adverse effects. Self-administered, at-home laser combs are on the market and depend on user prudence in following instructions.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: What are the hair loss treatments that are known to not work?</strong>
<br /><br />The world of hair loss remedies is littered with hair restoration scams. A spectacular case occurred in 2009, when a judge returned a $50 million verdict against the marketers of a product called Avacor on the basis that it could not live up to its marketing claims. In Illinois the state attorney general filed a lawsuit in 2009 against a multiunit hair restoration center for making exaggerated claims on what its program could deliver.
<br /><br />There are some companies that attempt to market products on the basis of hair strengthening and regrowth, including ordinary teas and shampoos or conditioners. Where such products are harmless or have other benefits (e.g., green tea), the question could be a simple &quot;What can it hurt?&quot; However, if these products are used in lieu of something more effective, valuable time may be lost as the hair loss progresses.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: How much of a role does nutrition play in hair regrowth?</strong>
<br /><br />Hair and skin are enhanced by healthy nutrients, without question. Keratin protein is actually manufactured by the body but optimally so when you ingest quality proteins: beef, turkey, eggs, tuna, shrimp, cod, halibut and salmon are among the better animal sources. But you can also get valuable protein from beans and nuts, seeds and whole grains. Note that Western diets have migrated to excessive protein intake since the 1950s, which can lead to other health problems. A variety of protein sources in moderate quantities -- more for people who engage in strength training and other strenuous exercise, less for sedentary individuals -- is what health experts recommend.
<br /><br />Sadly, some things work against your absorption of these nutrients: carbonated beverages, caffeine, tobacco smoke and excess processed sugar (found in most processed foods and drinks).
<br /><br />Beware, however, any nutritional supplement that claims it will restore hair growth, either through ingestion or topical application. Supplements as a rule are isolated nutrients, removed from other nutrients in their natural source and thus less likely to have a beneficial effect. A balance of nutrients that occurs naturally is more likely to yield a positive effect than will a megadose of one or two nutrients in isolation.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Why do most people choose to regrow hair versus simply accepting the loss?</strong>
<br /><br />Of course, this is entirely a matter of personal taste. But for some, a shaved head can be judged attractive while hairlessness on other people detracts from their appearance. Western culture affords greater acceptance of hair loss in men than in women -- even though 40 percent of women experience some hair loss during their lifetimes.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Who are the people who regrow their hair, and why?</strong>
<br /><br />As explained above, all individuals experience hair loss in their own way from their own causes. Some conditions naturally allow regrowth, yet certain others -- primarily androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness) -- do not. Interventions made early generally yield the best results for all conditions.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Do more women than men succeed at regrowing their hair?</strong>
<br /><br />There is not a simple answer to this question. Women more frequently suffer from reversible hair loss conditions than do men, for whom male pattern baldness is the most common cause of loss (it can be slowed with medication but is nearly impossible to reverse). According to Melissa Green, a hair regrowth specialist at Transitions of Indiana in Indianapolis, &quot;There is an 85 percent success rate with laser hair therapy. Typically, most men and women have success because even if that person looks the same after a program, which is great. Hair loss is progressive, and if that person would not have done a treatment program, they understand that [their hair loss] would worsen.&quot;

Alexander, who has played many iconic bald characters in television and motion pictures, including Seinfeld's George Costanza, has &quot;done more to further the cause of nonsurgical hair replacement than all the industry's marketing could ever have&quot;, according to HairLoss.com.</em>
<br /><br /><strong>Ft. Lauderdale, FL., January 18, 2012</strong> -- Jason Alexander, the iconic 52-year-old balding actor of Seinfeld fame has been named <em>HairLoss.com</em>'s 2011 &quot;Person of the Year&quot;. Alexander, one of Hollywood's most high profile bald actors, showed up to a September awards show in Beverly Hills donning a full head of hair. Months before he had told his fans on Twitter that he was looking into various hair loss treatments, including hair systems, and warned, &quot;Don't be shocked if you suddenly see picts of me with more hair than usual.&quot;
<br /><br />Since that time, Alexander has revealed on <em>Twitter</em> that his new look is &quot;a really good, semi-permanent hairpiece.&quot;
<br /><br />Such high-end, highly customized hairpieces are today marketed in the hair loss treatment industry as nonsurgical <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVN5c3RlbXMv" target="_blank">hair systems</a>. &quot;These are not the same hairpieces worn by our grandparents,&quot; said Michael Garcia, Spokesman for <em>HairLoss.com</em>. &quot;These hair systems, when designed and maintained by a talented practitioner, are completely undetectable to sight and touch and, because they are a nonsurgical hair replacement technique, they can instantly restore a person's natural, youthful appearance.&quot;
<br /><br />Alexander had been mum on which practitioner created his new look, but since then has revealed that Hollywood <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">hair replacement</a> artist Richard Farrell of Farrell Hair Replacement did the work. Farrell, who has long claimed to provide hair to some of Hollywood's biggest stars, convinced Alexander to discuss in depth his hair loss and his recent transformation in a video sent out to Farrell's prospects.
<br /><br />&quot;Jason Alexander has done some very good work to further the cause of this safe and natural cosmetic hair loss treatment that, when done right, can not only change one's look, but can change one's outlook on life,&quot; says Spokesman Garcia. &quot;Alexander is showing men everywhere that it's cool to wear hair and he's openly challenging the belief that wearing hair should be a hush-hush affair. Jason looks great and he feels great and what he's done by shunning the hairpiece closet is inspirational.&quot;
<br /><br />The famous character actor has openly discussed his hair systems with his 75,000 twitter followers, imploring them: &quot;Here's the deal. Here's why I did it. It's no big deal. Don't be afraid to look at it. Don't be afraid to talk about it.&quot;
<br /><br />According to Garcia, the state of the art of nonsurgical hair replacement has improved such that there are many practitioners all over the country who practice the craft expertly and creatively.
<br /><br />&quot;When you look at Jason, you understand why he talks openly about his hair replacement procedure; there's nothing to criticize. His own hair blends perfectly with his hair system. The hairline and recession pattern is age-appropriate and he's stressed the most important element about achieving this type of look,&quot; adds Garcia. &quot;That is, when people see that you look different than you did and they scan for what has changed and they see the illusion of hair growing out of your hair, the immediately move on to the next possibilities, which is 'did you lose weight' or 'did you have work done'. Nobody cares about whether you are wearing hair if it looks great. They quickly forget and you become the guy with cool hair.&quot;
<br /><br /><em>HairLoss.com</em> is proud to name Jason Alexander as 2011 &quot;Person of the Year&quot;. <em>HairLoss.com</em>'s free Concierge service is available to both men and women throughout the United States who desire to find reputable and experienced hair loss treatment providers who can achieve for them what was achieved for Jason Alexander.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_3857355_47712526.jpg" />
<br /><br />Is your hair thinning around the hairline, or is your part line widening? Do you have a bald spot or a scar? You may find success through hair replication.</strong>
<br /><br />If you love ink, you're going to love <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxpY2F0aW9uLw__" target="_blank">hair replication</a>. Modern tattoo artists and practitioners have such exacting tools, technologies and inks that they say they can replicate the &quot;look&quot; of hair follicles ... permanently. But this tattooing technique is still in its infancy ... so, buyer beware!
<br /><br /><strong>Is hair replication for you?</strong>
<br /><br />Do you currently have, or enjoy the idea of getting, tattoos?
<br />Are you a man willing to keep the buzz-cut look for the rest of your life?
<br />Are you a woman with a widening part line?
<br />Do you want to hide scars or patches from a hair transplant?
<br />Do you have a scar from an injury to hide?
<br />Do you have small bald patches from alopecia areata?
<br />Are your eyebrows nonexistent because of alopecia universalis?
<br />Are you willing to shield your head from the sun and protect the hair replication from environmental fade?
<br />Do you love wearing hats?
<br />Can you afford the cost?
<br /><br /><strong>How does hair replication work on men?</strong>
<br /><br />Currently, the procedure replicates the small hair follicle look of a man's shaved head. Depending on the amount of hair he still has left on his head, the size and shape of existing follicles and the shape of the hairline, the procedure, or tattoo, takes several hours and is usually completed in one day. The hardest part is replicating the hairline, which is where the artistry comes in. Otherwise, the procedure is the same as actually getting a tattoo, with the same permanent results and probable pitfalls.
<br /><br /><strong>How does hair replication help women's thinning hair?</strong>
<br /><br />This tattooing procedure works great to hide small missing patches and a common women's hair-thinning complaint: the widening part line. The tattoo procedure can fill in some of the color of the hair missing in a woman's widening part line and restore the normal appearance of her thinning hair. The cost and length of the procedure, or tattoo, depends on the size of the area to be filled in and is usually completed in under one day. The results are said to be as permanent as a tattoo.
<br /><br /><strong>What about the aging of a hair replication?</strong>
<br /><br />Experts say that touch-ups become necessary as you age, because any of your existing hair color no longer matches the replication. A tattoo artist can create a grayer, more natural aging color effect. Also, depending on the quality of the colors used (stay away from cosmetic pigments and look for a practitioner who uses the newest, longest-lasting micropigments), many artistic tattoo lines fade over time, resulting in distorted and blurred lines and off-colors; the same can hold true for a hair replication tattoo.
<br /><br /><strong>How should I care for my hair replication?</strong>
<br /><br />The most important care issue: Do not expose your tattooed scalp to the sun, ever. The sun causes the colors to fade, and the peeling skin after sunburn can also cause colors to fade as layers of the color peel off. If you don't enjoy wearing a hat or head wrap at all times when outdoors, do not consider a scalp tattoo or hair replication.
<br /><br /><strong>The bottom line</strong>
<br /><br />Check up on the practitioner by visiting the establishment, look at before-and-after photos in person and arrange to view a procedure. Also, ask for referrals to customers whose scalp tattoos you can see and feel; at the same time you can ask their opinion about the procedure. You will need to commit to a hair replication for a long time, since reversing and removing tattoos is a time-consuming and expensive procedure.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_7366976_47712581.jpg" />
<br /><br />Provided you have enough hair, hair loss concealers can be a simple and inexpensive way to achieve a natural look.</strong>
<br /><br />Hair loss is always going to be a matter of degree. You might have a little thinning at the top, if you are a guy. It's the beginning of a progressive condition that could leave you with a predominantly bald head a few years down the road. Women with androgenic alopecia more commonly lose their hair in a generalized distribution, but the loss can range from minor to extensive. Alopecia areata loss is distinct and asymmetrical but with wide variation in size and location.
<br /><br />So it makes sense that the solutions for achieving the look of a fuller head of hair would come in a broad variety as well. This article is about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUxvc3MtQ29uY2VhbGVycy8_" target="_blank">hair loss concealers</a>, the various products designed to address thinning areas where some follicles are still present and long enough to support externally applied, pigmented fibers.
<br /><br /><strong>Hair loss concealers: because you still have some hair there</strong>
<br /><br />The cause of androgenic alopecia is DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which causes hair follicles to lose color and shrink in size. But during the early stages of the balding process, those follicles are thicker and longer, even if more scalp is visible.
<br /><br />The purpose of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS8_" target="_blank">hair loss</a> concealers is to thicken those still-present fibers as well as to provide color. There are multiple products available on the market that accomplish this, with some that apply pigment to the scalp itself to enhance the illusion of thick hair.
<br /><br />Do they work? Apparently for some, they do. Web sites for these products suggest that you may never notice concealer on those who wear it because their products are so convincing. But most acknowledge limitations, largely defined by the degree of thinning the individual experiences. In other words, it works best on people with early-stage hair loss, less so on people who have advanced baldness.
<br /><br />It also depends on how the hair is styled, says a prominent Orlando hair stylist. &quot;They do help only if the hair has been given an appropriate haircut,&quot; says Mike Van den Abbeel, owner of Mosaic Hair Studio in Orlando, Fla. &quot;What I mean by 'appropriate' is short enough to help make the hair appear fuller. On long hair, the best they can do is hide the scalp on the part. Some people swear by them, while others don't see much difference.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>Hair loss concealers: different products, different applications</strong>
<br /><br />There are many manufacturers of hair loss concealer products, sold online and available through salons as well. Most are made from keratin, the protein that is naturally present in human hair, others with botanicals (plant-derived) and emollients (substances that soften and smooth skin and hair). The form they take and how they are applied fall roughly into four categories:
<br /><br /><strong>Granular sprinkles:</strong> Applied with a shaker; the powdery product adheres to existing hair shafts thanks to an electrostatic charge. Use of a brush or comb evens the distribution.
<br /><br /><strong>Aerosol:</strong> Applied just like hairspray; similar to the sprinkles. Users need to be very good at the application technique, particularly if you need to use mirrors to hit your target.
<br /><br /><strong>Solid:</strong> Applied with an applicator (brushes and wipes) that coats and thickens the hair. This is a little more time consuming but can create a more convincing appearance if done correctly.
<br /><br /><strong>Expanders and lotions:</strong> Expanders add volume to hair, with at least one manufacturer claiming to increase the size of individual fibers by 50 percent. Masking lotions are topically applied, viscous liquid compounds. 
<br /><br />Most of these products have very specific instructions for application and, in general, should be applied to dry hair that is not styled with other products. Clumping can occur if the hair is wet or coated with something else.
<br /><br />Van den Abbeel urges careful selection of products and use occasions. &quot;Ease of use and color tones should be considered,&quot; he says. And while some products claim you can swim and perspire without adverse consequences, he advises caution concerning anything that might dislodge the concealer by friction or moisture. &quot;These products work best when you are going out in some social setting, at work or on a date.&quot;

<br /><br />The key to avoiding hair loss is not to ignore it, says Shelly Beatty, owner and hair loss consultant of StyleMakers Salon in Fort Worth, TX, who says there is much that can be done if hair follicles are still alive. &quot;Once follicles are dead there is nothing you can do to bring them back to life, so if you notice changes in hair growth, thinning or fall-out, don't wait to see a doctor and a hair loss specialist!&quot; Using low-level <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9MYXNlci1IYWlyLVRoZXJhcHkv" target="_blank">laser hair therapy</a> can give lagging hair follicles a boost and it can work in conjunction with other treatments like DHT blockers such as Propecia and topical shampoos as well as topical minoxidil you may be considering or already using, for even more positive results. Typically you'll want to check with your primary care physician and a dermatologist to determine why you're losing your hair first, because this therapy works only for certain hair loss conditions. 
<br /><br /><strong>Is laser hair therapy for me?</strong>
<br /><br />Have you just recently noticed hair fall-out or changes in hair health?
<br />Are you experiencing age-related hair loss due to excess DHT?
<br />Are you using hair care products to remove DHT?
<br />Are you currently taking Propecia (finasteride) or using Rogaine (minoxidil)?
<br />Are you on any medications that could be causing temporary hair loss?
<br />Can you afford the time and money for weekly treatments?
<br /><br /><strong>How does laser hair therapy work?</strong>
<br /><br />If you answered YES to any of the above questions, low-level laser hair therapy is a viable way to target hair loss early. It can be administered through a hand-held unit or a full headed laser you might find at a hair loss clinic or studio. This hair loss treatment has been approved by the FDA to promote hair growth in males only with male pattern baldness who have Norwood Hamilton Classifications of I to V. The unit features diodes and LED lights that distribute low-level laser light to the scalp.
<br /><br />Because hair is meant to fall out and re-grow from the roots, when follicles begin to shrink and degenerate, the hair does not grow back and subsequently, hair loss occurs. Studies showed that the laser light therapy, when used on a regular basis can strengthen and regenerate shrinking follicles to grow again. The laser light increases blood flow to the scalp and jump-starts hair follicles. This slows down hair loss and in many cases is said to reverse the degenerative cycle and stimulate a live follicle to produce more, thicker, stronger, healthier hair.
<br /><br /><strong>What can I expect from laser hair therapy?</strong>
<br /><br />Experts agree it is key to find a hair loss professional to advise you in this treatment and/or administer it in the salon. Depending upon your reasons and amount of hair loss, you will most likely visit your salon 1-3 times a week for a treatment. But it does not work instantaneously, cautions Beatty. &quot;Don't expect a full head of hair in 8 weeks -- the follicle needs time to produce new hair, exit the scalp, and grow to a measurable length before you will notice results. Usually you can see results in about three months with significant results in about 6 months,&quot; explains Beatty. &quot;That's why we take close-up photographs of the hair loss area before the treatment and again every three months so you can see the improvement.&quot;
<br /><br />If your hair loss is severe experts agree that using low-level laser hair therapy will work best in conjunction with other treatments, like Propecia for men. Suggests Beatty, &quot;if your hair loss is age-related and you are producing DHT that is attacking follicles, I recommend using hair care products that remove and inhibit DHT from affecting follicles, so they can better benefit from the laser treatments.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>Complications of laser hair therapy</strong>
<br /><br />If your hair loss was temporary, a medical side effect or some other hormonal reason that was resolved, low-level laser hair therapy will re-grow hair faster and healthier. But, cautions Beatty, if your hair loss is progressive and you discontinue laser therapy your hair loss will revert to what it would have been if you had not done any treatments at all.
<br /><br />Also, when utilizing laser therapy devices, &quot;More is NOT better!&quot; cautions Beatty. Also low-level laser hair therapy will NOT work if you are losing hair due to chemotherapy or experiencing alopecia areata or have had extensive hair loss for more than five years.
<br /><br /><strong>The bottom line on laser hair therapy</strong>
<br /><br />The best results are obtained when you work with a hair loss specialist to devise a plan specific to your type of loss that includes evaluating results so expectations are realistic.
<br /><br />&quot;For the best results, look for a program that offers in-salon sessions with a powerful &quot;standing&quot; laser machine -- partnered with a high quality hand-held laser with adequate strength for at home use&quot;, says Beatty. &quot;We carry a handheld laser that has 9 diodes and cost approximately $500 to $600. &quot;The standing one I use in my salon is much more powerful with 92 diodes.&quot;

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_4062145_47713180.jpg" />
<br /><br />DID YOU KNOW? You can have each individual hair extension strand sewn in place one-at-a time to fit perfectly into your existing hair?</strong>
<br /><br />If you still have some healthy hair and are just missing some patches that aren't on top of your head, and are not in the midst of losing your hair, then you can consider having <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUV4dGVuc2lvbnMv" target="_blank">hair extensions</a> attached to cover the missing spots and extend existing hair -- an easy way to feel a whole lot better, fast!
<br /><br /><strong>How do hair extensions work?</strong>
<br /><br />As long as you are NOT currently in the midst of progressive hair loss and you have a lot of healthy hair to which hair extensions can be attached, you can achieve excellent results through hair extensions. There are many different types of hair extensions and different ways they can be attached, although for hair loss clients most specialist agree that sewing, knotting or tiny links is the best way to attach hair extensions to avoid further stress from chemicals, adhesives and heat.
<br /><br /><strong>Are hair extensions for me?</strong>
<br /><br />Do I have lots of healthy hair?
<br />Am I just missing a few permanent patches that are not on top of my head?
<br />Can I afford regular salon upkeep?
<br />What is my budget?
<br />Do I have alopecia areata?
<br />Is my hair loss temporary?
<br /><br /><strong>Custom-made hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />Custom hair extensions are an excellent choice for permanent or semi-permanent hair replacements that are designed to suit your particular hair color, texture, density, length, style and particular hair loss needs. Although they are your most expensive option, &quot;Each individual strand is sewn in to the custom-designed hair solution one strand of hair at a time, creating a system that can be integrated into your existing hair,&quot; explains Elline Surianello, owner of LeMetric Hair Center in New York City and herself a hair loss sufferer. After suffering for years with Alopecia areata, she developed her own system of creating hair replacements that are virtually undetectable and last several years, with regular care. Some hair extensions, depending upon how they are attached, may need to be removed and re-attached every few months. &quot;But unlike hair extensions that need to be replaced every few months, our system allows your hair style to be changeable, whether that means adding more hair, or changing the color or cut whenever you desire,&quot; explains Surianello.&quot; When you work with a hair loss professional, if you can afford it, the results will be more realistic and longer lasting because they will create a plan specifically tailored for your lifestyle, hair loss needs, and budget.
<br /><br /><strong>Pre-made hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />Most hair loss professionals would not recommend pre-made hair extensions to their hair loss clients because they are usually clipped or glued in -- both undesirable options when dealing with hair loss issues. They last typically only a few months, and they are not gentle to existing hair and can result in more hair loss and weakening, especially if applied improperly or by someone inexperienced with Hair Loss issues.
<br /><br /><strong>What can I expect from my hair extensions?</strong>
<br /><br />Custom-made hair extensions can cover bald spots and patches beautifully and if you can afford it, will give you the most natural looking results. While these systems should be maintained by a professional, you should also ask about special hair care products that don't contain sodium lauryl sulfate and are low on alcohol to create the gentlest environment you can for your existing hair advise hair stylists.
<br /><br /><strong>Find a skilled hair extensions practitioner:
<br /></strong>
<br />Ask to see before &amp; after photos of client
<br />Ask how long practitioner has been providing hair extensions
<br />Ask about methods
<br />Ask about the practitioner's experience with hair loss
<br /><br /><strong>The bottom line on hair extensions:</strong>
<br /><br />Be sure to do your research and have your hair loss diagnosis in hand before searching out hair extensions to make sure you're an appropriate candidate. The last thing you want to do is put your hair under more stress.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_7465285_47773234.jpg" />
<br /><br />Wigs are so sophisticated now that you can wear your hair up in a ponytail and away from your face. Bangs are no longer required to wear wigs.</strong>
<br /><br />Choosing a wig can be very overwhelming, especially if you're not feeling well. But you'll want to see the options available to cover up your hair loss in a way that's perfectly fitting for you. What type of hair? What color? What style? Will it fit? Will everyone know? What's a lace cap? Once you have the answers you'll feel a whole lot better about your choices and how you're going to look.
<br /><br /><strong>Which wig is for me?</strong>
<br /><br />Do I want low maintenance?
<br />What is my budget?
<br />Do I need the wig quickly?
<br />Do I want to style it myself?
<br />Do I have any hair on my head I want to keep?
<br />Is my hair loss temporary or permanent? 
<br /><br /><strong>5 steps to choose the wig that fits you best ..</strong>.
<br /><strong>
<br />1. Use a 'before' picture:</strong> The best way to get the most natural-looking wig is to bring a picture of you before your hair loss that shows your hair the way you like it to look and show it to your wig or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3MtdHJlYXRtZW50cy5odG1s" target="_blank">hair loss treatment</a> professional who will design and help you choose your wig. If you want a totally new look, then you don't need a picture.
<br /><br /><strong>2. Decide on pre-made or custom-made:</strong> The biggest obstacle to getting a custom-made wig is usually price -- these will be the highest quality, more expensive <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9XaWdzLw__" target="_blank">wigs</a>. Also you will need access to an experienced hair loss wig shop or salon. And the entire process takes time -- usually six to eight weeks&quot;, says Diahna Husbands, owner of Diahna Lynn Hair Studio in Maryland, who custom-designs and creates wigs for her clients. For a stock wig, either through mail-order or from a shop, you will still need some cranial measurements. The most common measurement is the one for the cap, so measure around your hairline starting at the top of your forehead, follow around the hairline down to the nape then back up to the top. For a custom wig, the stylist will take many other measurements and probably make a mold, for the most natural result.
<br /><br /><strong>3. Choose a hair type: </strong>There are many hair types, explains Husbands, and you want to be able to choose the one that fits your lifestyle needs and budget.
<br /><br /><strong>Virgin human hair </strong>
<br />Pros: Highest quality, un-processed, longest lasting, can be slept in, can be styled like your own hair with hot tools.
<br />Cons:  Most expensive running from $3,000 -- $5,000, longest creation time, highest maintenance and care.
<br /><br /><strong>Processed human hair </strong>
<br />Pros: Medium quality, called 'Remy' hair, minimally-processed to have the cuticle removed, best for temporary hair loss, can be styled, less expensive than virgin hair.
<br />Cons:  Lasts only about 6 months, can tangle.
<br /><br /><strong>Low-grade human hair </strong>
<br />Pros: Very inexpensive, temporary, can be styled using low-heat tools.
<br />Cons: Doesn't look or feel as 'natural,' doesn't last long, tangles easily.
<br /><br /><strong>Synthetic </strong>
<br />Pros: Minimal care, low maintenance, low cost.
<br />Cons: Not the most natural looking, temporary, cannot be styled using hot tools, will melt.
<br /><br /><strong>4. Choose a hair texture: </strong>For human hair types, you'll need to choose a texture as close to your own natural hair or what you now desire.
<br /><br /><strong>Chinese</strong> -- Dark, straight, thick, and shiny.
<br /><strong>Indian </strong>-- Dark, can have some wave, finer texture than Chinese.
<br /><strong>European</strong> -- Highest quality, any color, finer, more body, wave choices. Most expensive, most scarce. Jewish women choose this for religious reasons.
<br /><strong>Latin</strong> -- Costs less, widely available in different hair textures and types.
<br /><br /><strong>5. Choose a Cap:</strong> The cap is what the hair is attached to and it makes a difference in the way your scalp looks, how the wig fits into your lifestyle and whether or not you have any hair left on your head.
<br /><br /><strong>Lace</strong> -- Highest quality and most natural looking. Choose lace if you don't have much hair left because you'll have more styling options, says Husbands. &quot;You can wear hair back off your face and in a pony tail.&quot;
<br /><strong>Machine-made</strong> -- Traditional caps may not look as natural as the hand-tied or lace caps, but they are less expensive.
<br /><strong>Multidirectional </strong>-- Can be parted in any direction to look more natural, works with someone who still has hair they'd like to keep. Styling options are limited, not as natural-looking as lace.
<br /><strong>Thin skin</strong> -- Best for those that are very active or work out every day.
<br /><strong>Cap-less</strong> -- Open spaces between wefts or multidirectional wefts that can be worn permanently styles or teased.
<br /><br />&quot;I'll work with whatever type of wig you bring me to cut and style it just for your face -- I would do anything I can to make you feel better!&quot; -- Suki Duggan, owner of Donsuki Salon &amp; Spa in New York City.
<br /><br /><strong>The Bottom Line On Wigs</strong>
<br /><br />The final step is the most important one. Once you get your wig, take it to your stylist for a fitting and styling. Have the wig trimmed, cut and thinned to look the best on your face. Be sure your stylist has cut wigs before because it is very different from cutting hair, so ask! &quot;I'll work my magic with whatever type of cig to cut ans style it just for your face -- I would do anything I can make you feel more confident!&quot; says Husbands.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_7623242_47773331.jpg" />
<br /><br />There are many reasons you may find your hair thinning or falling out that can be resolved by your doctor and successfully treated. According to a recent article by Dr. Howard Levy, M.D. from Johns Hopkins, the main causes of thinning hair for both men and women are normal, common, and easy enough to prevent, diagnose and, perhaps, even treat successfully.
<br /><br />Hairstylists are very intuitive with their clients so ask yours for help as a first line of defense if you notice hair thinning or shedding. Many hairstylists find that they truly enjoy helping clients with thinning hair or that they've had a personal experience with the issue themselves. Elline Surianello, owner of LeMetric Hair Center Inc. in New York City, started her <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">hair replacement</a> center after suffering her own experiences with alopecia areata and realizing there were no services to help women with hair loss and thinning issues. &quot;Back in the 1980's there was nothing out there except wigs,&quot; she says. Shelly Beatty, owner and master stylist at Stylemakers Salon in Fort Worth, Texas, suffered hair loss after a thyroid surgery and also searched for solutions. &quot;In some cases, you can revive follicles before they die by treating hair loss right away. Don't wait,&quot; advises Beatty.
<br /><br />If you notice marked signs of hair loss and are concerned, a general rule of thumb would be to head straight to your physician and a dermatologist to rule out any serious health issues. That said, there are many changes you can make in your daily routines and habits that will improve the health and look of your hair.
<br /><br />If you notice hair thinning and fall-out ask yourself some tough questions and be honest with your answers!  Doing so can help you to better understand your health and lifestyle and help you <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUxvc3MtUHJldmVudGlvbi8_" target="_blank">prevent hair loss</a> before it begins.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Are you aware of any hormonal abnormalities or are you already on any medication for hormonal issues?</strong>
<br /><br />Many different hormone fluctuations, abnormalities, birth control regimens and medications can be associated with hair loss so if you can see no other reason why hair loss would be occurring, check in with your primary care physician for blood testing, advises endocrinologist Geoffrey Redmond, M.D. who specializes in hormonal abnormalities and hair loss.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: How do you treat your hair on a daily basis?</strong>
<br /><br />Tight ponytails and headbands, chemical hair treatments, improper use of heated styling tools can all cause breakage, called local trauma. Discuss your daily regimens with your hairstylist who can identify local trauma by the patterns of breakage and teach you how to avoid and correct the problem. If they can't help you, they will refer you to a physician or dermatologist who can.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Are you currently taking any medications?</strong>
<br /><br />Many medicines have a side effect of hair loss, with steroids and chemotherapy the most obvious culprits among a very long list. Check with your physician if you notice hair loss, especially when starting a new medication regimen.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Do you feel completely stressed-out?</strong>
<br /><br />Stress can affect your hair the same way it affects other major organs like the heart. Physical traumas as well as mental traumas can cause hair loss and thinning and many times cause hair problems three to six months after a traumatic event has occurred. Try to identify if this is the case or if your life is just too busy and try to make some changes.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Is something going on in your scalp you are unaware of?</strong>
<br /><br />Your first line of defense here is your hairstylist who can examine scalp and hair follicles and quickly identify product build-up, excessive sebum production, and fungal or other infections. These conditions can all reduce cell respiration at the bulb because sticky styling products not removed well enough attracts dirt and bacteria that plugs up pores and follicles leading to serious infections. If your hairstylist notices any signs of infection, he will likely refer you to a dermatologist for treatment to resolve the situation.
<br /><br /><strong>Q: Are you noticing your hair is getting thinner and shedding more than normal?</strong>
<br /><br />A single hair's natural cycle is for it to grow for several years, then naturally fall out and be replaced by new growth. If hair fall-out exceeds hair growth then thinning or baldness may become noticeable. Hair thinning is also a common sign of aging as natural hormones reduce in production and can be seen by the pattern of the thinning. Women are predisposed to general thinning while men have genetically predisposed receptors located in certain areas, which results in male pattern baldness.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_1420131_47773369.jpg" />
<br /><br />Hair extensions add volume, cover small bald spots, thicken thinning patches, add highlights or change your look entirely.</strong>
<br /><br />Hair extensions are the one type of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">hair replacement</a> that you don't have to wear on your scalp, because the replacement hair is attached to healthy hair you have on your head, providing you have enough. The one instance you cannot use extensions is for a bald spot on the top of your head, because then there is nothing to attach the extensions to, says Baha Alwardi, owner of Image First Hair Salon and Day Spa in Boynton Beach, Fla., who uses Ultratress hair extensions because of the variety of new technology in the application choices and the quality of the 100 percent human hair.
<br /><br />&quot;Always choose a very skilled and experienced professional to apply your hair extensions, especially if your hair is damaged or weakened by disease or diffuse thinning. If the right application for the right hair is used, then hair will not be damaged further and you can expect a more natural, healthier, beautiful appearance,&quot; explains Alwardi.
<br /><br /><strong>Extend your knowledge of hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />The type of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUV4dGVuc2lvbnMv" target="_blank">hair extensions</a> your stylist will choose for you depends on the application process and the reason you are seeking extensions in the first place, but it is an educated customer who gets the best results, advises Alwardi.
<br /><br />The sandwich technique with a &quot;cool&quot; application is perfect for the medical community and the fashion community. Clients of Alwardi's salon come with all types of hair problems, from naturally fine hair and simple thinning to those regrowing hair, from those undergoing chemotherapy to those suffering other hair loss traumas where a hot application method would not be appropriate. &quot;I use UltraTress II extensions on these clients,&quot; Alwardi says, &quot;because of the unique application process and because I can place these extensions higher up on the temples and up to the back of the head, in places other extensions won't work.&quot; The application technique uses a sandwich method between existing hairs with adhesive tape, he explains. &quot;I can add width and volume as well as length while protecting hair from damage, because it is supported on both sides with no ridges or bumps.&quot;
<br /><br />In addition, these hair extensions drastically reduce application time. &quot;While a regular full head of strand-by-strand hot glue extensions can take four to five hours,&quot; Alwardi notes, &quot;I can apply almost the whole head in about two hours. I save the strand-by-strand technique for the front of the client's face, where it is all-important to the final appearance.&quot;
<br /><br />Basic multiple-strand extensions and a safer &quot;hot&quot; adhesive are great for adding length and styling options. If you want more length but less damage, using a multiple-strand application technique reduces the stress on your hair and provides a virtually seamless transition. &quot;UltraStrands contains a unique hot adhesive that is polyester based, so it heats up ultra-quickly to diminish heat damage and dissolves into powder with its own solvent upon removal,&quot; says Alwardi.
<br /><br />Reusable strand-by-strand link extensions are customizable, cool and chemical free. These are the perfect solution to a chemical- and adhesive-free alternative for adding length, volume, color and styling options with less cost and less maintenance. &quot;And they are the best way to customize areas around the front strand-by-strand,&quot; continues Alwardi, who uses UltraLinks for the most natural effect around the hairline. &quot;These are simple to apply,&quot; he says. &quot;I just lift the strand, loop it and crimp the link, and it is that easy to remove and reuse, too!&quot; He explains that instead of dissolving adhesive, which makes other extensions unusable, these UltraLinks can be very quickly and simply loosened to clean out shedding, shifted up and tightened so the maintenance time and expense are drastically reduced for both the stylist and the client.
<br /><br /><strong>How to care for hair extensions 1-2-3</strong>
<br /><br />1. Use only a loop brush on your extensions because it is specially designed with bristles that are looped so they won't pull on attachments. You may also use a small bristle brush to push any shedding hairs down toward the attachment so they don't itch, advises Alwardi. Always brush from the bottom first to loosen tangles, not from the base of the scalp, because extended hair has the propensity to tangle easily.
<br /><br />2. Use only the hair care products recommended by your stylist for your type of extensions and attachment. To avoid tangling, sleep in a loose braid, shampoo hair in the shower only and avoid scrubbing hair with a towel. Rely on hot tools to style hair instead of constant brushing and blow-drying, which can cause extensions to slip prematurely.
<br /><br />3. Never skip your maintenance appointments of approximately every four weeks, because maintenance is the key to successful hair extension wear, concludes Alwardi.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_14647506_47773419.jpg" />
<br /><br />If you notice hair loss, visit your doctor for a diagnosis ... the sooner the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3MtdHJlYXRtZW50cy5odG1s" target="_blank">hair loss treatments</a> begin, the better the results.
<br /><br />&quot;In formal medical training, few physicians hear a word about Androgenic Alopecia, yet it affects 20% of women up to age 40 and even more after that,&quot; says endocrinologist Geoffrey Redmond, M.D. Because hair loss problems are often dismissed as trivial, women are frequently thwarted in their quest for help. Too often they are brushed off with remarks such as, &quot;Your tests are normal; there's nothing wrong with you.&quot;
<br /><br />He further explains that Alopecia falls in between specialties. Hair is part of the skin so it is included in dermatology. Yet the cause of the most common form, Androgenic Alopecia, is internal; a result of the actions of hormones which are the focus of a different specialty -- endocrinology. You may need to visit many doctors to get to the root of your problem.
<br /><br />Jan Ping, Emmy-winning TV hairstylist and cosmetologist has first-hand experience with losing her hair due to chemotherapy, having been a Cancer survivor herself. &quot;In my volunteer work with the American Cancer Society's 'Look Good, Feel Better' Program, I found that women's fear of losing their hair actually tops the fear of losing their life to the Cancer!&quot;
<br /><br />Since you don't know why you are losing your hair you need to visit a doctor for a proper diagnosis because your hair loss may be treatable and reversible like hormone imbalances, side effects to medications, scalp and follicle infections, stress and nutritional deficiencies.
<br /><br /><strong>Diagnose your hair loss condition</strong>
<br /><br />Is your hair just 'thinner'? 
<br />Is your 'part' wider? 
<br />Is your hairline receding or different in some way? 
<br />Do you have any bald spots or patches that appeared recently?
<br />Does thinning or hair loss run in your family? 
<br /><br />Obviously if you're having a problem with hair thinning, get to your hairstylist first. There are some routine and normal reasons for thinning and hair loss in both men and women. Your hairstylist can identify those stemming from improper use of styling tools or too much styling product build-up on the scalp and can teach you how to avoid and solve the problem. If you notice marked signs of hair loss, a general rule of thumb would be to head straight to your physician and a dermatologist to rule out any scalp and serious systemic health issues advises the National <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9BbG9wZWNpYS1BcmVhdGEv" target="_blank">Alopecia Areata</a> Foundation. If you get no satisfaction, your doctor may refer you further to an endocrinologist or other specialist. But only your doctor can help diagnose whether your condition is serious and treatable.
<br /><br /><strong>Assess your overall health</strong>
<br /><br />There are many other simple reasons aside from hair follicle diseases that you may find your hair thinning or falling out from that can be resolved by your doctor and successfully treated. According to a recent article by Dr. Howard Levy, an internal medicine specialist at Johns Hopkins, the main causes of thinning hair for both men and women are hormonal abnormalities, local trauma, medications, stress, scalp inflammation, and normal age variation. Your doctor may ask you about your diet, your lifestyle, medications you are taking and how you are feeling in general to determine your overall health and any other clues to your hair loss. Blood tests will also identify specific causes of hair loss.
<br /><br /><strong>Prescribe medication, treatment and help</strong>
<br /><br />Depending upon the diagnosis, most hair follicle problems are reversible and treatable with medication. And when the diagnosis is simple, your hair loss can be totally reversible and treatable. If the results are more complicated your doctor may refer you to further specialists for treatment including support groups.
<br /><br /><strong>Get insurance to pay for the wig</strong>
<br /><br />&quot;First of all don't call it a wig,&quot; cautions Shelly Beatty, owner of Stylemakers Salon in Fort Worth, Texas who deals extensively in medical hair loss issues for her clients. &quot;The medical term for wigs is 'Cranial Prosthesis' and you'll need your doctor to write a prescription for it.&quot; Many insurance companies that cover prostheses of any kind will also cover a medically necessary wig for those who experience total hair loss due to medical reasons, she advises. Once you have the prescription, you can work with your hairstylist to determine what your insurance will pay for and decide on a type of wig or treatment that fits the parameters.
<br /><br /><strong>Give you peace of mind</strong>
<br /><br />You may find that your hair loss is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about or that you have a follicle infection or that it's something more serious. But at least you'll be on the right path to doing something about it!

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_13637132_48938111.jpg" />
<br /><br /><strong>The world of hair systems can be full of conflicting and confusing information, so let's try to get some facts straight ...</strong>
<br /><br />When it comes to actually wearing hair, or using a hair system, you may have some very good questions as to how it all works, starting with what the term &quot;hair system&quot; really means.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. What's the difference between a hair system and a hair replacement?</strong>
<br /><br />Both terms mean the same thing. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">Hair replacement</a> includes any type of non-surgical solution for hair loss that uses additional hair. A hairpiece, wig, extension or hair system refers to the actual portion of hair made to take the place of any missing hair on your head.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. How many hair systems do I need?</strong>
<br /><br />You may have heard a lot of conflicting information about how many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVN5c3RlbXMv" target="_blank">hair systems</a> people need. Some may say that you need two to start out with so you can rotate them and wear a fresh one while another is being repaired and/or maintained. But it depends on your hair system and your hair loss situation. Nowadays hair systems are made using such lightweight materials (the heavier the hair and cap, the less natural a hair system will look) that they are sometimes disposable, requiring a new one every time, about every eight weeks or so. These lighter hair systems may cost a little less for each one, but you will need a new one each time for best results.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Why throw one away when it looks perfectly fine?</strong>
<br /><br />You replace a hair system before it shows any wear. Otherwise outsiders might be able to see a hair system's hair loss or cap fraying -- and you wouldn't want that!
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Does it always have to be the same style of hair system over and over?</strong>
<br /><br />That's your choice. If you're adventurous and want to switch styles or colors, you can certainly work with the stylist to create different hair systems, or you can stick with one that represents &quot;your look&quot; time and time again.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Will my hair system change as I age over the years?</strong>
<br /><br />You want your hair system to be as realistic and natural as possible, and if that includes shortening your style or showing some graying, your stylist will strive to make your hair system as age appropriate as you desire, matching it to your facial shape and skin tone. For men, lessening the amount of hair to match any overall thinning or pattern baldness around the system may also be appropriate as you age.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Are hair systems for men different from those for women?</strong>
<br /><br />All hair systems contain a base material, hair and a means of attachment. Each is created and styled depending on a person's specific hair loss situation, lifestyle needs and budget considerations.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. I have long, thinning hair. Do I have to cut it all off to wear a hair system?</strong>
<br /><br />No, your stylist can work with your long hair, even combining it with your new hair system. When wearing a full hair replacement, or wig, you may find it cleaner, easier to care for and more comfortable to keep your remaining hair cut short. But if you're uneasy about it, your stylist can work with you and your hair to find which way makes you feel best.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Are there any considerations I should be aware of if I wear a hair system?</strong>
<br /><br />Aside from your lifestyle loosening your hair system, keeping up with maintenance and following all directions, you need to keep track of any medications your are taking, since some can cause adverse reactions to certain adhesives. If you experience irritation or a reaction to your adhesive, alert your hair replacement professional, who can suggest an alternative means of attachment. Another consideration is not to neglect a scalp check for any changes to moles or other signs of skin cancer. If you spend a lot of time outdoors or in the sun, cover your head and hair system with a hat to protect against sunburn and overexposure to the sun, which can lead to skin cancer and also an eventual discoloring or fading of your hair system.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Can I have the kind of hair system that is removed at night, or does it have to be attached for a month or more at a time?</strong>
<br /><br />It is totally your choice as to how you want your hair system to be attached and also how much care you want to take with attaching it yourself. Your hair replacement specialist will work with your lifestyle considerations to determine the best method of attachment and a schedule for removal.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. What is the difference between a custom-made hair system and an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; hair system?</strong>
<br /><br />A custom-made hair system is made by molding and measuring your head or hair loss area and is created strand by strand to match your exact hair density and hairline; these are usually the most expensive types. A ready-made hair system can be bought off the shelf but will still be cut, colored and styled based on your skin tone and facial shape by working with your hair replacement specialist stylist.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_13518375_48938148.jpg" />
<br /><br />Hair systems have been worn throughout history as a status symbol, as a practical head protection or to cover hair loss. With today's technology, hair systems have evolved to cover up every type of hair loss but in the most inconspicuous way.</strong>
<br /><br />It's interesting that hair loss has had a bad rap since before the year one. Between 1 B.C. and A.D. 1, the Roman poet Ovid, famous for his erotic works of love, wrote Ars Amatoria (&quot;The Art of Love&quot; ), vividly displaying his bald bias with the following: &quot;Ugly are hornless bulls, a field without grass is an eyesore, so is a tree without leaves, so is a head without hair.&quot; Even Julius Caesar was noted by historians to be uneasy about his baldness and tried to hide it by brushing his hair up and toward his face and willingly wore the honor of the laurel crown whenever possible because it hid his baldness. Later, around A.D. 800-900, even the character Scheherazade from The Arabian Nights asks, &quot;Is there anything more ugly in the world than a man beardless and bald as an artichoke?&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>The first hair systems were found in ancient Egypt</strong>
<br /><br />Because ornate wigs were first found in the tombs of the pharaohs, it was thought that wigs and toupees (a partial <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">hair replacement</a> usually worn on the top of the head) were worn only by the powerful, as a status symbol. But in a 1997 dig near the predynastic capital of Egypt called Hierakonpolis, an ancient working-class cemetery was discovered with a focus on hair. Of the three mummified women, one had gray hair colored with henna, another had hair woven with extensions and a third wore the earliest toupee (made from sheepskin) ever found, dating back to approximately 3200-3100 B.C. The ancient Egyptians also wore hairpieces attached with beeswax and resins to shield their shaved heads from the sun. Wigs were mainly found in ancient Western cultures, including those of the Greeks and Romans, but not in the Far East, where wigs were mainly part of costumes.
<br /><br />A photograph owned by the New York Public Library depicts another type of Egyptian wig and wig box found in an Egyptian tomb and believed to date back to the 18th dynasty, 1400 B.C. The wig is made of human hair and attached to netting, much the way it is done today. According to the TV show &quot;How It's Made,&quot; the oldest way of creating a hairpiece was to use goatskin to simulate the scalp and then hook hair into it using an embroidery needle.
<br /><br /><strong>The first wig-makers' guild was formed in 17th-century France</strong>
<br /><br />After the fall of the Roman Empire, wigs fell out of use for thousands of years until about the 16th century, when they were reintroduced for practical purposes aside from improving appearance. Because of the unhygienic conditions of the era, head lice was a problem, so people shaved their head and wore a wig, which was easily deloused. It was the royals who perpetuated the elaborate wig trend for men into a frenzy in the 17th century, hence the term &quot;big wig,&quot; as King Louis XIV of France (1638--1715) was depicted in paintings.
<br /><br />A wig-makers' guild of skilled professionals was established in France in 1665 because 17th-century wigs were increasingly long and showy and expensive to produce. They were made from natural human hair, but around the time of the plague, this caused uneasiness, as wearers wondered if the wig was made from the hair of someone dead from the plague! The hair of horses and goats was often used as a less expensive alternative.
<br /><br />During the 18th century, the trend in hairstyling for women, depicted in paintings of Marie Antoinette, included very high hair extended upward with artificial hairpieces, other objects, hair from animals and elaborate themes all held together with lard; the lard eventually became rancid and attracted vermin as the women slept, originating the term &quot;rat's nest.&quot;
<br /><br />The powdering of wigs began as delousing and evolved into a pure white coloring for men and a bluish-gray tint for women. Fancy powdered wigs on men and powdered natural hair with supplemental hairpieces on women were an essential part of full-dress occasions and were used until almost the end of the 18th century. In 1795, the British government levied a tax on hair powder, which effectively ruined the powdered-hair and -wig trend.
<br /><br /><strong>The 19th and 20th centuries and the demise of the word &quot;toupee&quot;</strong>
<br /><br />The wearing of wigs as a symbol of social status was largely abandoned in the newly created United States and in France at the beginning of the 19th century, although wigs continued to be worn in the military and the court system. Only the first five American presidents, from George Washington to James Monroe, wore the powdered wigs of 18th-century Europe. By the early 20th century, wigs fell out of fashion and were often worn mostly by old women who had lost their hair.
<br /><br />Most wigs are made by hooking hair one strand at a time into a fine lace or netting. Modern base materials for hand-tied human hairpieces usually consist of a combination of skinlike thin material such as polyester mesh, silk, monofilament, silicone or thin polyurethane. Because the hair is pulled through and knotted strand by strand, similar to rug hooking, the term &quot;wearing a rug&quot; became synonymous with wearing a toupee and was the butt of jokes in mainstream pop culture in the 20th century. Laurel and Hardy used slapstick toupee humor during the 1920s and '30s. Before that, Thaddeus Stevens, a 19th-century U.S. congressman known for his quick humor, once ripped off his toupee and handed it to a woman who had asked for a lock of his hair (collecting locks of hair was like collecting autographs).
<br /><br />According to the U.S. Patent Office, even the name has evolved: The first toupee patent was filed in 1921 and the first hairpiece patent was filed in 1956. Toupees are now referred to as hairpieces or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVN5c3RlbXMv" target="_blank">hair systems</a> to avoid the negative and humorous associations with the word &quot;toupee.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>20th-century hair systems become mainstream for men</strong>
<br /><br />By the 1950s, hairpiece manufacturers started to build credibility by successfully advertising hairpieces to men in major magazines and newspapers -- and even the Sears Catalog. The craftsmanship had also evolved, pioneered by Max Factor, the Hollywood makeup artist whose hairpieces were almost invisible, with each strand of hair sewed to a piece of fine flesh-colored lace.
<br /><br />By 1959, Time magazine estimated annual U.S. sales of toupees at $15 million. And by 1970, Time estimated that 2.5 million out of 17 to 20 million balding American men wore toupees, mostly because of improvements in toupee technology and craftsmanship and a desire to appear younger. The mid-1970s gave rise to the Hair Club for Men and founder Sy Sperling's famous tagline, &quot;I'm not only the Hair Club president, I'm also a client,&quot; to prove how well made and natural looking his hairpieces were using his &quot;Bio-Matrix Strand-by-Strand Technology.&quot;
<br /><br />It wasn't until 1998 that the adhesive cyanoacrylate was FDA approved as Derma Bond, a medical-grade adhesive, and embraced by the hair replacement industry as a long-lasting, better way to adhere a hair system to the head than traditional weaves, which caused traction alopecia (hair loss due to the pulling of the attachment) and irritation from other tapes and adhesives that were being used. This type of adhesive allows skin to breathe and hair to grow and was perfect for very active lifestyles and for a lower-maintenance, more permanent bond. Still, the hair system business was never geared toward women.
<br /><br /><strong>Fast-forward to 2011 and undetectable hair systems</strong>
<br /><br />With today's technology, non-surgical hair replacement procedures focus on the simulation of a realistic natural, undetectable hairline. Using a new thin, light and breathable material similar to that of a contact lens, hair replacements and custom solutions, using names such as SensiGraft and new technologies such as Folligraft, in which the hairs are directly applied to the scalp, have elevated the technology of hair replacement and hair systems.
<br /><br />Now there is an emphasis on solving women's hair loss and thinning issues, and because of the newest technologies women can now wear hair systems rather than full wigs if their hair loss is confined to the top and crown of their heads or integration units when thinning occurs all over the head or at the part line.

<br />Frequently Asked Questions About Hair Systems for Men
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_2388450_48938181.jpg" />
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVN5c3RlbXMv" target="_blank">Hair systems</a> for men have evolved far beyond the toupee. Learn how today's hair systems can give your hair back to you and change your life.
<br /><br />Q. Why should I get a non-surgical hair system instead of a hair transplant?</strong>
<br /><br />Men lose their hair in a predictable way, a pattern called male pattern baldness (or androgenic or androgenetic alopecia), but aging; stress; medications; poor grooming, sleeping and nutrition habits; and illnesses such as lupus, diabetes and heart disease can all speed up the hair loss process. A surgical hair transplant can replace hair in a bald spot but will not protect against future additional hair loss around the transplant. A non-surgical hair system is your best bet even if you are a candidate for a transplant, because you won't have to worry about future thinning or anything else.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. I'm afraid my hair system will fall off -- does that still happen?</strong>
<br /><br />No, your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVJlcGxhY2VtZW50Lw__" target="_blank">hair replacement</a> specialist will set a maintenance schedule so that your adhesive and attachments are performing optimally as well as to avoid any noticeable wear and tear on your hair system.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. I don't want anyone to laugh at me or know that I am wearing a hair system. How can that be avoided?</strong>
<br /><br />Today's hair systems are so technologically and artistically advanced that they are virtually undetectable. Manufacturers can even use a base material similar to what is in a contact lens that is so light and breathable it looks as if hair is growing right out of the scalp. Skilled hair replacement specialists can match any scalp color and hairline (from photos of you) and also determine a maintenance plan so that wear on the hair system never shows.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. How many hair systems do I need?</strong>
<br /><br />You may hear conflicting information about how many hair systems you will need. Your plan depends on the type of hair system you are wearing as well as your lifestyle. If you are very active, you may need more maintenance and more hair systems. Some hair replacement specialists may say that you need two to start out with so you can rotate them and wear a fresh one while another is being repaired and maintained. Many hair systems are made using such lightweight materials (the heavier the hair and cap, the less natural a hair system will look) that they are disposable, requiring a new one every time, about every eight weeks or so.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Why throw a hair system away when it looks perfectly fine?</strong>
<br /><br />You should replace a hair system before it shows any wear. Otherwise outsiders might be able to see a hair system's hair loss or cap fraying -- and you wouldn't want that!
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Does the hair system always have to have the same style over and over?</strong>
<br /><br />If you're adventurous and want to switch styles or colors, you can certainly work with the stylist to create different hair systems, or you can stick with one that represents &quot;your look&quot; time and time again.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Will my hair system change as I age?</strong>
<br /><br />Everyone should want their hair system to be as realistic and natural as possible, and if that includes shortening your style or showing some graying, your stylist will strive to make your hair system as age appropriate as you desire, matching it to your changing facial shape, hair color, hair texture and skin tone. For men, lessening the amount of hair to match any overall thinning or pattern baldness around the system also may be appropriate as you age.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. Can I have the kind of hair system that is removed at night, or does it have to be attached for a month or more at a time?</strong>
<br /><br />It is your choice how you want your hair system to be attached and also how much care you want to take with attaching it yourself. Your hair replacement specialist will work with your lifestyle considerations to determine the best method of attachment and schedule for removal and replacement.
<br /><br /><strong>Q. What is the difference between a custom-made hair system and an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; hair system?</strong>

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_6409212_49021513.jpg" />
<br /><br />Hair extensions can add length and thickness to your hair. Follow these tips to find the right hair extensions expert for you.</strong>
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLUV4dGVuc2lvbnMv" target="_blank">Hair extensions</a> can add volume and length to your hair, even if you are suffering from hair loss. Not all hairstylists are created equal, however -- some are much better than others. These suggestions can help you find a professional stylist with the qualifications and expertise necessary to provide you with high-quality, long-lasting, beautiful results.
<br /><br /><strong>Ask friends and relatives with hair extensions</strong>
<br /><br />The best resource is to ask someone you know with hair extensions. If you have friends, family members or acquaintances who wear extensions (and are satisfied with them), ask who does their hair and learn more about their experience. Find out what types of bonds are used, the approximate costs of the extensions and other details that are important to you.
<br /><br /><strong>Call reputable salons in your area</strong>
<br /><br />Sometimes cold calling is necessary to find a hair extensions expert. Make a list of the top salons in your area. Call and ask for their most experienced stylist working with hair extensions. Tell the person about the condition of your hair and any issues that you have with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20v" target="_blank">hair loss</a>.
<br /><br />Set up a consultation with two or three experts and meet them all before actually booking an appointment for your hair extensions.
<br /><br />&quot;And though you usually get what you pay for, the most expensive salon is not necessarily the best,&quot; says hair extensions stylist Jillian Montgomery of Los Angeles. &quot;The key is finding a stylist who is experienced with hair loss and also knowledgeable about a variety of different types of extensions.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>Ask the right questions of your hair extensions expert</strong>
<br /><br />At your consultations, arm yourself with a list of questions to help you make the right decision about your hair extensions.
<br /><br />What type of hair do they use?
<br />    What type of bond or attachment method do they use?
<br />    What type of training have they had?
<br />    How much experience do they have with hair extensions?
<br />    Are they certified in hair extensions?
<br />    Is hair loss their specialty?
<br />    Can they provide client references?
<br />    How long will it take to attach the extensions?
<br />    How much will the service cost in its entirety?
<br />    How long will the extensions last?
<br /><br />&quot;At your preliminary visit, be sure to ask the stylist to show you pictures of their past work,&quot; says Giovanni Mele, owner of Giovanni &amp; Pileggi salon in Philadelphia. Also, if they aren't able to provide client references, take your business elsewhere.
<br /><strong>
<br />Look online for reviews of hair extensions experts</strong>
<br /><br />Online you'll find a number of websites where you can read customer reviews of hair salons and hairstylists specializing in hair extensions. Check out general websites such as Yelp.com and Citysearch.com for local reviews, as well as sites that specialize in hair salon ratings, such as Salonratingz.com. These websites feature profiles of various salons and stylists, along with honest opinions from clients who have used the services in the past. On the Internet, you'll also find websites such as Hairextensionsnetwork.com, where you can search for hair extensions experts in your area.
<br /><br />The application of hair extensions is not a quick process. It's very important that you are comfortable with your stylist. During your initial consultation, make sure you have a connection and develop a rapport with this person. You will need to sit in his or her salon for several hours and possibly come back for future visits. You must be confident in the stylist's capabilities, as well as comfortable enough to ask questions, express your needs and voice your concerns. The decision to get hair extensions can be a wonderful one if you select the right expert for you.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_12243865_49021670.jpg" />
<br /><br />When first announced as cures for hair loss, both <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXJvZ2FpbmUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Rogaine</a> (minoxidil) and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXByb3BlY2lhLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Propecia</a> (finasteride) were hailed to be as important as the introduction of birth control pills and the Salk vaccine. Finally, going bald would be a choice, not an immutable verdict of nature.</strong>
<br /><br />Both have been available for a generation of use and proved to be helpful to men (both medications) and women (Rogaine only). But each comes with its own set of efficacy, side effects and costs. Following are the pros and cons of each, to help you decide if either is right for you.
<br /><br /><strong>Propecia &amp; Rogaine: External versus internal application</strong>
<br /><br />Rogaine is applied topically to the scalp (foam or lotion), and Propecia is taken internally as a pill. Rogaine must be applied twice daily without interruption to remain effective, and uninterrupted use is required of Propecia as well.
<br /><br />For many people something you apply directly to the skin will always be preferred over an internal medication. This is because some medications that pass through the digestive system and the liver can be detrimental to certain internal organs. There are no known serious detrimental effects on the liver or other internal organs from taking Propecia.
<br /><br /><strong>Propecia &amp; Rogaine: Effectiveness</strong>
<br /><br />Both Propecia and Rogaine are effective but in varying degrees with different types of individuals. Propecia, according to Merck &amp; Co., its manufacturer, halts hair loss in a majority of those taking it (86 percent) and helps regrow hair in almost half (48 percent) of patients. The product is not available for women. Rogaine is 30 to 40 percent effective in its regular (2 percent) formulation and between 50 and 60 percent with its extra-strength (5 percent) version. Dense regrowth of hair, however, is uncommon (8 percent of users), and actual gains in hair count are less frequent as well (30 percent). It is more effective for women than for men.
<br /><br />With both Propecia and Rogaine, earlier use in patients under 40 will yield the greatest results. And the baldness that is prevented or reversed tends to be on the crown of the head, not at the hairline (which will continue to recede over time).
<br /><br /><strong>Propecia &amp; Rogaine: Major and minor side effects</strong>
<br /><br />Rogaine can cause skin irritation, which includes burning, scaling, itchiness, dryness and flaking, at the point of application (crown of the head). Users are advised to limit sun exposure for this reason. Other, rarer side effects include lightheadedness, rapid heart rate, chest pain, swelling (stomach, face, hands or ankles), breathing difficulty and weight gain. Women who are or who could become pregnant are advised against using Rogaine.
<br /><br />Propecia is particularly problematic for women who may be pregnant (and, in particular, their male fetuses). Mere exposure to a broken pill, in contact with the skin, can lead to genital abnormalities in the male fetus. Men taking Propecia experience — at a rate of about 3.8 percent — adverse effects, which may include erectile dysfunction, decreased volume of ejaculate and decreased libido, as well as itchiness, hives, swelling of the lips and face and testicular pain.
<br /><br /><strong>Propecia &amp; Rogaine: Can they be combined?</strong>
<br /><br />The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) takes no official position on whether combination therapy, using both Rogaine and Propecia, is either dangerous or more effective, or both. Several online Web sites feature individuals who claim a synergistic effect of using both simultaneously.
<br /><br /><strong>Cost and prescription vs. over the counter</strong>
<br /><br />Rogaine in a 5 percent solution starts at about $19 for a three-month supply — generic brands are less expensive than the original brand, which can be priced at more than twice as much. It has been available without a prescription since 1998. Propecia ranges in cost via online suppliers from $28 to $71 for a monthly supply. It requires a prescription from a medical doctor.
<br /><br />So, has either Propecia or Rogaine lived up to its expectation? That seems to depend on the individual using them. Personal choices about cost, side effects and daily maintenance schedules are generally what drives individuals to try and continue to use these medications (or not).

<br /><br />Wigs, in one form or another, have been around as long as there have been people with hair loss. That's a long time.</strong>
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9XaWdzLw__" target="_blank">Wigs</a> have existed for centuries. Let's take a look at the evolution of wigs from ancient times to modern day.
<br /><br /><strong>Wigs in ancient times</strong>
<br /><br />Wigs have been around since the days of ancient Egypt. Egyptians would shave their heads because of the danger of lice and the area's hot climate. In public, however, they wanted to have hair, so they would wear wigs. Egyptian men and women wore wigs as part of their daily wardrobe. Women often embellished their wigs with ivory ornaments and gold accents. The size and stature of people's wigs would oftentimes indicate their social or political rank. The more fancy and elaborate the wigs, the higher their status.
<br /><br />Egyptians weren't the only ancient civilization to wear wigs. Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians and other cultures often donned wigs -- particularly the wealthy population. During this time period in ancient Japan and China, wigs were worn only by actors or performers. Wigs were made from both animal hair and human hair.
<br /><br /><strong>Wigs during the Renaissance</strong>
<br /><br />During the Middle Ages, wigs weren't important or popular, since beauty and fashion were not at the forefront; however in the Renaissance period wigs emerged again as women showed off their hairstyles. It was quite common for well-to-do women to have several wigs adorned with elaborate jewels and other embellishments.
<br /><br /><strong>Covering baldness</strong>
<br /><br />Although Louis XIII of France might not have been the first man to disguise his baldness with a wig, he may be the most famous of his time. After going prematurely bald, he amassed a collection of elaborate wigs that he would wear for every occasion. During the 17th century both men and women of nobility in France and across Europe wore wigs. It was soon customary for all people of any stature to wear exquisite hairpieces.
<br /><br /><strong>Powdered wigs</strong>
<br /><br />In the 18th century sky-high, white powdered wigs made of horsehair were commonplace. These wigs featured many curls and long ringlets. &quot;Big hair&quot; was definitely trendy for European men and women. Wig makers had begun to emerge from Paris and throughout Europe. And as more wigs were produced, they became more readily available to the general population, rather than just the privileged.
<br /><br />In colonial America as well, powdered wigs were popular. There the styles were shorter and simpler than for their European counterparts. These powdered bob wigs were worn by political figures as well as javascript://middle-class people. By the end of the 18th century, the popularity of wigs began to fade. Soon wigs were worn only by those in the court and some aristocracy.
<br /><br /><strong>Wigs in the 20th century</strong>
<br /><br />During the 20th century, because of advances in technology in wig making, wigs looked more like natural hairstyles. Both synthetic and human-hair wigs are now available almost everywhere in the world. Human-hair wigs are the most versatile, as they can be styled in every way imaginable; however, synthetic wigs are easier to maintain than natural-hair wigs and are generally less expensive.
<br /><br />Although wigs are not as common as they were in centuries gone by, many people wear them to hide <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS8_" target="_blank">hair loss</a> or to effortlessly change hairstyles. Some performers -- from Cher to Dolly Parton -- wear wigs on stage, and of course wigs are always popular as part of costumes on Halloween.
<br /><br /><strong>For those suffering from hair loss, wigs can be an essential part of your everyday wardrobe.</strong>
<br /><br />From the earliest of civilizations, wigs have been used by men and women for both practical and cosmetic reasons. Today, wigs have advanced to the point that there is a hairpiece to serve every conceivable niche.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_11502787_49076627.jpg" />
<br /><br />Choosing the right wig isn't a simple matter. Fortunately, we've done the research for you.</strong>
<br /><br />Whether you are experiencing a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3MtY29uZGl0aW9ucy5odG1s" target="_blank">hair loss condition</a> or you just desire a new look, a wig is a simple, affordable and fantastic option.
<br /><strong>
<br />The cost of a wig</strong>
<br /><br />The first thing you'll want to consider is your budget. High-end <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS93aWdz" target="_blank">wigs</a> can cost thousands of dollars. While they are worth the money, you may not have that type of cash to spend on a wig. If that's the case, you will be glad to know there are other options that offer cheaper solutions.
<br /><br />Wigs usually feature either synthetic hair or real human hair. Additionally, the wigs are either machine-made or handmade. The cheapest wigs use synthetic hair and are machine-made, while the most expensive wigs use 100 percent human hair and are handmade.
<br /><br /><strong>Real versus synthetic hair</strong>
<br /><br />Authentic human hair has one big advantage: It looks and acts natural. You can style it just like you would your own hair. Its versatility is a major selling point. For example, if you want to add curls, straighten it or change color, it's easy to do.
<br /><br />Even though synthetic hair isn't nearly as versatile, its durability is actually better than real human hair. If you lead an active lifestyle, synthetic could be a better option. Maintaining a wig that uses synthetic hair is a breeze, and the wig itself will last longer. Also remember that synthetic hair is much cheaper than human hair.
<br /><br /><strong>Handmade or machine-made wigs</strong>
<br /><br />When you are comparing wigs, you may notice that handmade wigs often look more natural than machine-made ones. Most handmade wigs are sewn one strand at a time, which adds a realistic appearance. That said, technology is rapidly advancing in this field, so modern machine-made wigs are looking better and better. You will need to compare the two options side by side to determine whether the increased cost of the handmade version is worth it to you.
<br /><br /><strong>A custom fit wig</strong>
<br /><br />Another big decision when you are shopping for a wig is whether you are going to order a custom wig. You may opt to purchase a premade wig, which will save you time and money. A custom wig could take months to construct and could be exponentially more expensive; however, the advantages are numerous. Not only will a custom wig fit perfectly, but also it can be made to blend with your current hair to create the hairstyle of your dreams.
<br /><br />When shopping for a premade wig, never make a purchase without trying it on. Ask a lot of questions so that you know exactly what you are buying. If you want real human hair, beware of wigs that claim to be human hair but are actually blended with synthetic hair. Look in the mirror from all angles and also make natural movements to ensure that the wig will stay in place.
<br /><br /><strong>Color me beautiful</strong>
<br /><br />Selecting the color of your wig is the real fun! Don't limit yourself to colors to which you are accustomed. Instead, consider going a few shades darker or lighter. Sometimes making a drastic change -- such as going from brunette to blonde -- can make your wig appear even more natural because the color change will stand out, not the fact that you are wearing a wig.
<br /><br />Unsure of the color and style of wig you want? You can find software online that allows you to upload your picture and digitally &quot;try on&quot; different hairstyles and colors with a few clicks of your mouse. Check out: TheHairStyler.com, Taaz.com and other virtual makeover Web sites. If you find a look that you love, print it out and take it with you when you go wig shopping.
<br /><br />The most important thing to remember is to be patient. Buying a quality wig is an investment; you will want the wig to last at least a few years. Shop around, look for stores that specialize in wigs and consider all your options.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_597756_49076704.jpg" />
<br /><br />While Propecia is the only FDA-approved oral prescription regimen to help halt hair loss in men, use of the medication can pose some sexual side effects, although not permanent, doctors say.</strong>
<br /><br />&quot;I call it vitamin P,&quot; says Dr. Sara Wasserbauer, a Walnut-Creek, California-based board-certified hair transplant surgeon, &quot;because taken daily, it strengthens follicles and keeps them growing, which is especially useful in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVRyYW5zcGxhbnQtU3VyZ2VyeS8_" target="_blank">hair transplant surgery</a> cases, where you want to halt any additional hair loss around the newly transplanted area.&quot; Dr. Laurence Kirwan, a plastic surgeon specializing in hair transplants, who recently had his own hair transplant, swears by Propecia. &quot;Propecia stops hair loss from increasing and helps the transplant grafts grow in strong and healthy, so I use it myself.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>Possible sexual side effects of Propecia in a small percentage of men</strong>
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXByb3BlY2lhLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Propecia</a> (generic, finasteride) is also heralded by young men who want to keep their follicles alive, but it doesn't come without some side effects, according to Propecia's own Web site. Although in clinical studies by Merck Research Laboratories, makers of Propecia, these side effects were minimal, they are an important consideration because they are sexual in nature. According to the drug' s Web site, sexual side effects of Propecia can include:
<br /><br />Diminished sexual desire
<br />    Erection difficulties
<br />    Decrease in semen count
<br />    Breast enlargement or tenderness
<br />    Nipple discharge
<br /><br />Kirwan continues, &quot;As for sexual side effects, I haven't had any, but if I did, I'd stop taking the medication immediately because the literature shows that the side effects are temporary and would resolve upon stopping Propecia permanently. I can see how men would be terrified, but the small percentage of men this happens to would most likely not be you.&quot;
<br /><br />In contrast, Wasserbauer explains that usually sexual side effects will subside once the body acclimates to the medication, so she suggests waiting it out for a few weeks. Since Propecia causes an increase in testosterone initially, when you begin taking it, your body responds by decreasing testosterone production, which can cause the sexual side effects. &quot;What most men don't realize, or don't want to wait for, is that the testosterone imbalance corrects itself after a few days and any sexual side effects will subside, so I advise my male patients to wait it out before discontinuing or giving up on Propecia.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong>Current studies on sexual side effects of Propecia: temporary or permanent?</strong>
<br /><br />According to Propecia's Web site, any sexual side effects reversed upon discontinuation of the medication, but recently, a new study, published in the December 2010 issue of Journal of Sexual Medicine, set out to define the sexual ramifications of Propecia use. &quot;Although the adverse side effects of these agents are thought to be minimal, the magnitude of adverse effects on sexual function, gynecomastia, depression, and quality of life remains ill-defined,&quot; states the study's objective. Following a review of all the literature and studies, the researchers found adverse persistent sexual side effects in a small subset of men.
<br /><br /><strong>Experiment with the correct dosing of Propecia for you</strong>
<br /><br />Dr. Robert Bernstein, hair transplant surgeon and hair loss specialist at Bernstein Medical Center for Hair Restoration in New York City, advises his male patients taking Propecia who experience any side effects that bother them to perform the following dosing evaluation:
<br /><br />Discontinue the Propecia until the side effects have gone
<br />    For 2 weeks, take one-quarter pill a day
<br />    If there are no side effects, take one-half pill per day for the next 2 weeks
<br />    If no side effects occur, return to full dose of 1 pill per day
<br />    If you experience side effects, go back to the level that you had no problem and stay at that level for at least 1-2 months before trying to increase the dose again
<br /><br />The bottom line, concludes Wasserbauer, is your own comfort level and paying attention to your body to outweigh any possible side effects against the benefits you are experiencing with Propecia to treat your hair loss.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_10669197_49076755.jpg" />
<br /><br />Your scalp is even more susceptible to burning than skin is because it directly faces the sun's rays at all times.</strong>
<br /><br />By virtue of the fact that it covers the scalp, hair provides protection from the sun's harmful rays. &quot;But if you notice your hair thinning or you have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS8_" target="_blank">hair loss</a> of any kind for any reason, it's important to protect your scalp from sun damage, precancer and skin cancer,&quot; says Dr. Eric Schweiger, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist and hair transplant surgeon at Bernstein Medical -- Center for Hair Restoration in New York City. That's because 100 percent of the surface area on top of your head directly faces the sun's burning rays when the sun is strongest, between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
<br /><br />&quot;In general, a mild sunburn on your scalp won't harm your hair follicles. But any exposure that causes blistering can cause scarring and precancer cells, which will harm hair follicles permanently, so you need to take special care of your scalp when exposed to the sun, even for only a few minutes,&quot; explains Schweiger.
<br /><br /><strong>What you must know about hair loss and scalp protection</strong>
<br /><br />Protect your scalp. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recognize six skin categories, from fair skin easily burned in a few minutes of overhead sun exposure to more olive and black skins.
<br /><br />Whatever type of skin you have generally is the same for your scalp. If you have hair loss and hair thinning, be sure to protect your scalp, specifically with sunscreen, when outside. The AAD recommends that regardless of skin type you use a broad-spectrum (protection from UVA and UVB rays), water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30 year-round.
<br /><br />You can burn in the shade. Even on a cloudy day, your scalp is at risk; up to 80 percent of the sun's ultraviolet rays can pass through the clouds. In addition, if you're active outdoors and spend time at the beach or on the slopes, keep in mind that sand reflects 25 percent of the sun's rays and snow reflects 80 percent of the sun's rays, according to the Global Solar UV Index, literature about sun safety from the World Health Organization.
<br /><br />Healing hair transplant? If you've had <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9IYWlyLVRyYW5zcGxhbnQtU3VyZ2VyeS8_" target="_blank">hair transplant surgery</a>, avoid the sun for at least a month after the procedure, and to do that, your best protection is wearing a hat, says Dr. Schweiger. Avoid sunscreen during this period, too, as the chemicals in sunscreens may irritate healing scalp and follicles; just after your hair transplant, your immune system may be a little overactive and you can have an allergic response to chemicals.
<br /><br />Spray-on sunscreens are great for the scalp. Sunscreens come in many forms, such as ointments, creams, gels, lotions, sprays and sticks, but the spray-on type can coat the scalp between hairs and reach down to the base of the hair shaft and fill crevices better than a greasy lotion can, advises Schweiger. A gel might also work for you because gel absorbs faster than other forms without leaving residue on hair and scalp, but you will need to be diligent about its application. A study published in the Archives of Dermatology in 2002 found that most people apply only 25 to 50 percent of the recommended amount of sunscreen, so to be sure of complete coverage, use a spray-on variety. The AAD recommends that sunscreens be applied to dry skin 15 to 30 minutes before heading outdoors.
<br /><br />Stay away from tanning beds, too. In spite of claims that tanning beds offer &quot;safe&quot; tanning, the artificial light sources used at tanning salons such as those for beds, lamps, bulbs and booths do emit UVA and UVB radiation. Because the amount of the radiation produced during indoor tanning is similar to the sun and in some cases may be even stronger, the AAD recommends against indoor tanning.

<br /><br /><strong>Under 60 points: </strong>&quot;You are your hair's worse enemy. Forgive yourself for not learning the proper way to treat your hair (We can't learn everything!) but stop abusing your hair and treat it with kindness.
<br /><br />Nick Arrojo, TV makeover hairstylist star of TLC's &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; gives us the straight talk on how to shampoo the right way.
<br /><br /><strong>1. False. </strong>Too much brushing causes breakage and split ends.
<br /><br /><strong>2. B.</strong> Hot water dries out your scalp and hair and cold water does not dissolve dirt as well.
<br /><br /><strong>3. True.</strong> A cool water rinse closes the cuticle (the outer most layer of each hair shaft) to keep hair smooth and shiny.
<br /><br /><strong>4. B.</strong> Shampoo belongs on the scalp to dissolve oil and dirt there. Hair length gets clean just by rinsing the shampoo out. Use a dime-sized dollop and rub the product in your hands first, then massage gently over scalp. Don't pile hair up or rub shampoo down through hair ends because both cause damage. A gentle finger-tip massage cleans scalp best without hair damage. Never use fingernails because they scratch and can cause infections!
<br /><br /><strong>5. False.</strong> 'Squeaky clean' means natural oils that keep hair shiny and healthy are stripped from your hair. 
<br /><br /><strong>6. True.</strong> Brushing stiff, sticky hair will cause breakage. Try to switch from sticky styling products that contain alcohol to crème-based styling products, to protect brittle or thin hair.
<br /><br /><strong>7. C.</strong> Press a towel over your head and hair starting at the top and working your way down to absorb the moisture, letting gravity work. Twisting or rubbing a towel on wet hair inflicts major damage.
<br /><br /><strong>8. False.</strong> Lather is just soap which dries hair out. Just a dime-sized dollop will get your scalp clean, and you never need to lather twice, no matter what shampoo bottles say! 
<br /><br /><strong>9. B. </strong>Always keep a wide-toothed comb in your shower to comb conditioner throughout hair and detangle hair afterwards.
<br /><br /><strong>10. False.</strong> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a very harsh detergent that causes thin hair to become even drier and more brittle. Look for shampoo formulations without this damaging ingredient.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_4025361_49167355.jpg" />
<br /><br />Minoxidil works as a hair loss treatment, but not as easily as people think it does.</strong>
<br /><br />The smart brand marketing of Rogaine (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLW1pbm94aWRpbC5odG1s" target="_blank">minoxidil</a>) when it was approved for over-the-counter sales led millions to expect to regain hair with ease. But 14 years later, have real experiences with the product lived up to hype?
<br /><br />Not for everyone. It works for only about 50 percent of patients who try it. Generally speaking, they are under the age of 40 and in an early phase of hair loss (i.e., thinning began less than five years ago). In other words, start using it as soon as you begin to notice a bald spot.
<br /><br />Note: the second pharmaceutical product available for hair loss treatment, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXByb3BlY2lhLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Propecia</a> (finasteride), is reviewed in separate articles on HairLoss.com.
<br /><br /><strong>Minoxidil works, but only to a certain extent</strong>
<br /><br />Minoxidil (brand names include Rogaine, Women's Rogaine, Rogaine for Men Extra Strength, Regaine, Apo-Gain, Gen-Minoxidol, Hairgro, Minox, Med Minoxidil, Hair Regrowth Treatment) works only on individuals, male and female, with androgenic alopecia (also known as male pattern baldness). For reasons unknown, minoxidil is slightly more effective for women than for men.
<br /><br />The location of where you are losing your hair seems to matter a lot as well. The crown of the head, the vertex, is much more responsive to minoxidil than is frontal or hairline loss. One study (D. S. Walsh, C. L. Dunn and W. D. James, &quot;Improvement in Androgenetic Alopecia (Stage V) Using Topical Minoxidil in a Retinoid Vehicle and Oral Finasteride&quot; [Arch Dermatol, 1995]) found that 36 percent of users experienced sufficient results over 30 months of use such that they felt compelled to spend time and money on the product. Of study participants, 32 percent said new hair growth was long enough that it had to be cut (often the regrowth is more of a peach fuzz than strands of hair).
<br /><br />Not so surprisingly, formula strength matters -- it's a situation where more is more. Regular Rogaine, a 2 percent concentration formula, and Rogaine for Men Extra Strength, a 5 percent solution, have been compared side by side in a couple of studies. One (V. H. Price and E. Menefee, &quot;Quantitative Estimation of Hair Growth: Comparative Changes in Weight and Hair Count with 5 percent and 2 percent Minoxidil, Placebo, and No Treatment&quot; [Elsevier, 1996]) compared hair mass, which is the weight of hair in a defined area of the scalp, in both products to find that the extra-strength formula indeed produced a 55 percent increase, compared with a 25 percent increase in the lower-concentration formula, after five months of use. Importantly, that mass-effect declined with both products after five years' use, to 25 percent and 15 percent increases, respectively.
<br /><br />The second study looked at actual hair counts, finding that the higher-strength formula does result in more hair shafts per square centimeter: 25 additional hair follicles per square centimeter from the 5 percent solution, versus 21 follicles in the 2 percent solution and 9 follicles in a placebo group, after a 48-week period (R. J. Trancik, &quot;Update on Topical Minoxidil in Hair Loss&quot; [Proceeding of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology, 1998]).
<br /><br />One effective application is for hair loss due to chemotherapy. Research sponsored by Rogaine's manufacturer, the Upjohn Company (now Pharmacia), on 22 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer found that the 2 percent topical solution decreased the duration of alopecia caused by chemotherapy, with no significant side effects (Duvic, Lemak et al., Division of Medicine, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1996).
<br /><br /><strong>How does minoxidil work?</strong>
<br /><br />How minoxidil reduces hair loss is actually a mystery, since it was discovered by accident when use of the anti-hypertension drug Loniten was found to increase and darken fine body hairs. One imagines the scientists working on this had their eureka moment within one or two nanoseconds of coming upon this fact.
<br /><br />But two decades later, no one knows for sure how it works. It may be due to the way the medication dilates blood vessels, which on the scalp might stimulate hair growth. Minoxidil is a potassium channel opener, which causes hyperpolarization of cell membranes, possibly another reason it works.
<br /><br />To stem hair loss, minoxidil is applied topically (as a cream or foam). In pill form the medication is in a higher concentration and only approved for treating hypertension.
<br /><br /><strong>There are side effects to minoxidil</strong>
<br /><br />For the person first using minoxidil, there is often an initial period of paradoxical increased hair loss. Disturbing as that may be, this seems to be the scalp's way of ridding itself of weaker hair follicles to make way for stronger shafts. Other known side effects and issues are:
<br /><br />•	Scalp irritation, likely because of the product's alcohol content
<br />•	Itchy scalp and dandruff
<br />•	Dizziness or rapid heartbeat (rare)
<br />•	Not recommended when the scalp is already irritated, injured or sunburned, which would allow the medication to be absorbed by the body at a higher and potentially dangerous level 
<br />•	Formulated for scalp application and not recommended for use elsewhere on the body
<br />•	Effects on a fetus in women who are pregnant are unknown; however, women who are nursing are warned to not use it
<br />•	Rogaine users with severe, refractory high blood pressure might experience hypertrichosis, which is hair growth on the face or other bodily areas. The incidence of this occurs in about 3-5 percent of women who use the 2 percent solution and higher among women using the 5 percent solution.
<br /><br /><em>Note that no animal or human studies indicate cause f or concern regarding cancer and minoxidil.</em>
<br /><br /><strong>Costs of minoxidil (and beware the snake oil salespeople)</strong>
<br /><br />According to online stores selling Rogaine, a three-month supply of the foam product is about $50, which is much lower than when the medication was first released (and protected by its original manufacturer by its patent, which expired in 1996).
<br /><br />But at least one company that operated clinics and treatment centers for hair loss, Avacor (Global Vision Product, Inc.), falsely claimed superior treatments that amounted to nothing more than a minoxidil solution repackaged as a shampoo (sold alongside herbal supplements that lacked clinical studies to support claims of efficacy). A class action lawsuit was successful in driving the clinics out of business. This case serves as a reminder that any medical solutions should be investigated closely for legitimacy -- and how hair regrowth charlatans are always looking to make money from people who are experiencing hair loss.
<br /><br /><strong>Minoxidil: The bottom line</strong>
<br /><br />To summarize, minoxidil will be most effective if you
<br /><br />•	Use it as soon as you start to notice a thinning 
<br />•	Are under age 40 
<br />•	Are a woman; women get better results than men 
<br />•	Use the stronger solution, as it will yield more results 
<br />•	Are attentive to potential side effects, particularly if your scalp is irritated by sun or the medication itself 
<br />•	Stay out of the sun or always wear a hat when outdoors
<br />•	Accept the fact the results in five years won't be as good as in one year
<br />•	Plan to continue using it to realize any beneficial effect

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_5773084_49167456.jpg" />
<br /><br />Propecia didn't start as a hair loss treatment, but for some, it is effective.</strong>
<br /><br />Like Rogaine (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLW1pbm94aWRpbC5odG1s" target="_blank">minoxidil</a>), Propecia -- also called &quot;finasteride&quot; -- is a drug that was developed for another purpose (shrinking noncancerous enlarged prostates) but, by accident, was found to be able to stimulate the growth of hair that had thinned from androgenic alopecia.
<br /><br />But if you are the kind of person who worries about medication side effects and unintended consequences, you need to consider those that come with Propecia.
<br /><br />The good news is it works for a majority of the people who try it -- about half stem further loss of hair, while the other half experience new growth. The bad news is women should not use it. In fact, women who could be pregnant should probably not be in the same house with it, owing to a specific and devastating side effect (see &quot;Side effects on women, fetuses and young children,&quot; below).
<br /><br /><strong>Propecia works for a majority of those who use it</strong>
<br /><br />Because the manufacturer of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLXByb3BlY2lhLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Propecia</a>, the first brand approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be marketed as a treatment for male pattern baldness, is Merck Pharmaceutical, the most extensive research on efficacy of finasteride is conducted by the company. Merck's five-year clinical tracking of 279 men on Propecia revealed the following:
<br /><br />•	42 percent visibly halted hair loss (according to blind assessments of photos by dermatologists)
<br />•	48 percent visibly regrew hair (according to blind assessments of photos by dermatologists)
<br />•	66 percent regrew hair, as measured by hair counts
<br /><br />As with minoxidil, use of Propecia needs to be consistent and continuous for it to be and remain effective. Also, its effects are only on hair follicles found on the crown (vertex) of the head, not the forehead or other areas.
<br /><br /><strong>How does Propecia work?</strong>
<br /><br />The mechanisms for how Propecia works at restoring hair growth are better understood than those for minoxidil. But there still is a bit of uncertainty because the exact mechanisms in hair loss itself are not fully established. Androgenic alopecia is probably caused by excess DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a metabolite of testosterone (i.e., testosterone typically is converted to DHT in some areas, including the scalp). Too much DHT is believed to shrink hair follicles to the point where hair is barely visible. Propecia reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT by 60-70 percent, which apparently reduces the negative impact of DHT on hair follicle health.
<br /><br />But a question lingers: How comfortable are you with ingesting a prescriptive medication, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood?
<br /><br /><strong>There are side effects to Propecia</strong>
<br /><br />Every action has a reaction, of course, particularly in the human endocrine system. By reducing the transformation of testosterone to something else, the guy taking Propecia is left with more testosterone.
<br /><br />That's a good thing, right? Maybe yes, maybe no or maybe it doesn't matter. As men age, testosterone levels naturally decline (more so with poor lifestyle habits such as overeating, inactivity and excessive consumption of alcohol), so a little extra testosterone might be beneficial. But too much testosterone is associated with impulsivity, aggression, irritability and depression. DHT conversion is important elsewhere in the body, and a deficiency can paradoxically lead to an overexpression of naturally present estrogen (all men have estrogen, in lower proportions than in women). In a small percentage of men, that means enlarged breasts (gynecomastia).
<br /><br />Other side effects seen in a small portion (less than 5 percent) of men using Propecia to address male pattern baldness are:
<br /><br />•	Hypersensitivity (itching and hives, swelling of the lips and face)
<br />•	Testicular pain
<br />•	Increased libido (10 percent in the first months of use)
<br />•	Decreased libido (1 percent throughout its use)
<br />•	Erectile dysfunction
<br />•	Decreased volume of ejaculate
<br /><br />Additionally, men who ask their doctor for a Propecia prescription need also to inform him or her if they have any of the following pre-existing conditions:
<br /><br />•	Liver disease or abnormal liver enzyme tests
<br />•	Prostate cancer
<br />•	Bladder muscle disorder
<br />•	Stricture of the urethra
<br />•	Restricted ability to urinate
<br /><br /><strong>Side effects of Propecia on women, fetuses and young children</strong>
<br /><br />The only clinical study of Propecia on women was on individuals who were postmenopausal, and the research indicated no beneficial effect from its use. It's possible to be critical of that finding, since older women may not realize the same results as younger woman with androgenic alopecia.
<br /><br />Why not test it on younger women? Propecia is a teratogen, which means it can cause birth defects. Specifically, exposure of even powder from a broken Propecia tablet to the skin of a pregnant woman can cause abnormalities of the external genitalia of a male fetus. There is further concern that young children similarly exposed may experience adverse affects as well.
<br /><br />Clearly, it's a risk to be taken seriously.
<br /><br /><strong>Can a guy combine Rogaine and Propecia for extra effectiveness?</strong>
<br /><br />Many Web sites -- particularly those selling hair loss prevention products that include Propecia and minoxidil -- advocate use of both products, a double-hit at the scalp from outside and in. The anecdotal claims are that the results are synergistic.
<br /><br />It should be noted that no data exist to support either efficacy or safety claims of this practice.
<br /><br /><strong>Cost of Propecia</strong>
<br /><br />A four-week supply of Propecia costs approximately $60. Most insurance plans would not cover the cost of this medication for hair loss applications.
<br /><br />To summarize, Propecia will be most effective if you:
<br /><br />•	Are male 
<br />•	Do not have certain pre-existing conditions such as problems with the liver, prostate or bladder
<br />•	Are comfortable taking oral medications that have a hormonal effect
<br />•	Are not in the presence of either a woman who is pregnant or younger children, or can assuredly keep the medication isolated from them
<br />•	Are comfortable with the lack of long-term use data (i.e., the product was first approved for marketing as a hair loss treatment in 1997; therefore, there is no research on adverse side effects over many years)

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/156310069_11999908_49167684.jpg" />
<br /><br />Laser hair therapy has been in use in Europe for decades but the FDA only recently vouched for this hair loss treatment's safety.</strong>
<br /><br />The application of low-level laser therapy (LLLT), or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9MYXNlci1IYWlyLVRoZXJhcHkv" target="_blank">laser hair therapy</a>, to address hair loss was first discovered by accident -- with laboratory mice. Researchers were testing laser on wounds, where the hair around the wound was shaved. What they noticed in the mice receiving LLLT versus those who weren't (the control group) was their hair grew back faster.
<br /><br />Since then, and for more than 30 years, researchers and hair restoration therapists have been using the technique on humans. Popular for decades throughout Europe, laser hair therapy received approval as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007. This approval is all about safety -- the FDA does not confirm or deny efficacy.
<br /><br /><strong>How laser hair therapy safely restores hair growth</strong>
<br /><br />To appreciate how LLLT is safe, it helps to understand how it works.
<br /><br />LLLT approaches the treatment of thinning hair from a noninvasive standpoint. Equipment varies somewhat, but between 110 and 116 laser diodes are directed at the scalp, typically applied in a head cap (it can also be administered with a handheld comb ). The light is in the 630- to 670-nanometer range, which is where the color red occurs on the light spectrum. The power of the light is at low wattage, which allows it to remain cool throughout the procedure.
<br /><br />The exposure of the scalp to these tiny beams of light is called photobiology, which causes reactions on both physical and chemical levels. Hair follicles, in particular the very tiny hairs on follicles where loss is progressing, absorb this light. The reaction happens on an intracellular level, where cytochrome c, an enzyme, sends photochemical signals throughout the hair follicle. The result is a decrease in apoptosis, or programmed cell death.
<br /><br />The actual efficacy (&quot;does it work?&quot; ) of laser hair therapy is subject to variations among individuals. Those variations are:
<br /><br />•	<strong>What type of hair loss is occurring?</strong> Primarily male and female patients with androgenetic (also called androgenic) alopecia can benefit from LLLT. That means it can benefit male pattern baldness and female pattern baldness, but other causes such as alopecia universalis or trichotillomania will not be affected by it. Some claim it can be used for alopecia areata and with individuals undergoing chemotherapy.
<br />•	<strong>Is the hair loss recent or long-standing?</strong> Laser hair therapy is probably most effective where hair is actively receding, not on hair lost a long time ago. There needs to be some life left in those follicles for it to receive the laser, translate it on an intracellular level and stimulate growth.
<br />•	<strong>Did the patient get regular treatment?</strong> Twice-weekly exposures to the light, continued for a full year, seems to be essential to achieve results. Almost all LLLT proponents discourage sporadic use of the technique.
<br /><br />All that said, there are no peer-reviewed scholarly journals reporting double-blind studies that scientifically prove effectiveness. Most results are self-reported. Painstaking measurements in higher-priced studios where laser hair therapy is administered show an increase in hair shafts and overall thickness of those shafts in those areas where hair growth has not fully ceased.
<br /><br />Note that LLLT is often used in combination with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYWlybG9zcy5jb20vaG9tZS9oYWlyLWxvc3Mtc29sdXRpb25zLW1pbm94aWRpbC5odG1s" target="_blank">minoxidil</a> (Rogaine and other brands), finasteride (Propecia) and hair transplant surgery, reportedly with good results in all such cases.
<br /><br /><strong>On your own with handheld laser hair therapy combs</strong>
<br /><br />Self-administered laser hair therapy with handheld combs is available. These devices are typically sold at a lower power (wattage). While that may be perceived as a safety advantage, it cannot overcome the &quot;more is more&quot; mentality. If someone chooses to overuse his or her comb -- spending hours every day, perhaps in a desperate attempt to regrow hair quickly -- the worst outcome is ineffectiveness. The body's reaction to the light can diminish with excessive and constant use. There are no reported cases of this actually happening. Because these are cool lasers, there is no concern about overexposure causing burns.
