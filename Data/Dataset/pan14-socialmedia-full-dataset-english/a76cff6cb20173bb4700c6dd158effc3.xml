<br />I MISSED THE BUS AND THERE´LL BE HELL TODAY, I´M LATE FOR WORK AGAIN.
<br />AND EVEN IF I´M THERE, THEY´LL ALL IMPLY THAT I MIGHT NOT LAST THE DAY.
<br />AND THEN YOU CALL ME AND IT´S NOT SO BAD, IT´S NOT SO BAD AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
<br />OH, JUST TO BE WITH YOU IS HAVING THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
<br />PUSH THE DOOR, I´M HOME AT LAST AND I´M SOAKING THROUGH AND THROUGH.
<br />THEN YOU HAND ME A TOWEL AND ALL I SEE IS YOU.
<br />AND EVEN IF MY HOUSE FALLS DOWN, I WOULDN´T HAVE A CLUE, BECAUSE YOU´RE NEAR ME. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE. OH, JUST TO BE WITH YOU IS HAVING THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
<br />OH, JUST TO BE WITH YOU IS HAVING THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE

If anyone, should ever write, my life story, for whatever reason there might be, you'd be there, between each line of pain and glory, because your the best thing that ever happened to me, Oh your the best thing that ever happened to me. There have been times, when times were hard, but always somehow I made it, I made it through, But for every moment that I've been hurting, there's been a moment, that I've spent..... Oh just loving you, If anyone should ever write my life story, for whatever, for whatever reason there might be, you'd be there, between each line of pain and glory, because your the best thing that ever happened to me, Oh your the best thing that ever happened to me, don't you know, your the best thing.... Oh that ever happened, to me
