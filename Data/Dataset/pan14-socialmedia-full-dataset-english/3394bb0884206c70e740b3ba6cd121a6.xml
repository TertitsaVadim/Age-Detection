<br /><br />Continental, a German company with its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., removed brake and steering controls in a Volkswagen Passat and replaced them with sensors and advanced technology to read the surroundings and drive accordingly.
<br /><br />To qualify for Nevada’s special license, Continental engineers have racked up and documented almost 10,000 miles of autonomous driving. That included a recent trip from Las Vegas to Brimley, Mich., near Sault Ste. Marie, where Continental has a development and testing center nestled in the forest.
<br /><br />More than 90% of the journey was without a hand on the wheel or a foot on a pedal, said Ibro Muharemovic, one of three engineers riding shotgun.
<br /><br />A final trip is being planned to hit the 10,000-mile mark in the next few weeks.
<br /><br />Most of the technology is already on the market as safety features to avoid accidents or mitigate their severity.
<br /><br />Google started the debate about autonomous driving when it took a Toyota Prius and attached sophisticated but expensive equipment so the car could drive itself.
<br /><br />Engineers at auto supplier Continental want to continue the conversation with a semiautonomous version that is a more affordable and shorter-term solution.
<br /><br />The team equipped a Volkswagen Passat with Continental technology, creating a car that pretty much drives itself in two of the most stressful and least satisfying driving conditions: stop-and-go traffic and boring stretches of highway.
<br /><br />Both companies are chasing the same goals: reduce accidents, congestion and fuel consumption. With driverless cars, the age and state of the driver doesn’t matter, and parking isn’t an issue when cars can drop off passengers and drive home.
<br /><br />“There is a strong business case for an autonomous car that can drop you off or a cab without the expense of a driver,” said Chief Executive Ravi Pandit of KPIT Cummins, a global IT and engineering company in Pune, India.
<br /><br />This is the future of the auto industry, and it is happening faster than consumers realize.
<br /><br />A semiautonomous car is still a couple of years from production, but much of the safety technology that makes it possible is on the market now.
<br /><br />Yet the idea of cars driving themselves raises questions about liability and regulation and whether the public is ready to accept them. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWxpYWJsZXRvcC5jb20vU3VwcGx5LWF1dG8tZGlhZ25vc3RpYy10b29sc19jMg__" target="_blank">Auto Diagnostic Tool</a>
<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will start studying aspects of autonomous driving in August with a one-year pilot project in Ann Arbor, Mich., to test 3,000 cars with equipment to communicate with one another to prevent accidents. Officials have expressed support for technology that addresses distracted driving and prevents accidents.

<br /><br />Althongh the car can drive by themselves , there are also come across lots of problems ,the car safty performance of the vehicle is become the key that the diagnostic equipment is more and more important. And today I will introduce you a useful tool,that is Original Launch X431 AUTOBOOK . It is in a good appearance, and book-shape makes hand hold convenient. It is with Wide coverage, almost all vehicles can be tested, including European, American and Asian cars. its main functions include read DTCs, clear DTCs, read data stream and read System information for engine, A/T, SRS and ABS, however, for highlighting its practicability and high quality with reasonable price, special diagnostic function is abandoned. AUTOBook is designed like a book which is more accordable with ergonomics, and this makes it delicate, portable and strong expansibility. It will definitely be accepted by auto mechanic.
<br />No metter how many problem it  has we can always deal with it and make our life more and more better. More information please refer to : <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWxpYWJsZXRvcC5jb20_" target="_blank">obd2 connector</a>

Brazil is enjoying an economic boom, in some sence due to the reasons discussed in this presentation. The prosperity is flowing down to the middle class. AP reports that Brazilian tourists spent $5.9 billion in the U.S. in 2010. Many would say that the Brazilians, bolstered by a strong currency, saved the retail industry in Miami the last 2-3 years.
<br /><br />In spite of the wide reaching economic prosperity in Brazil, there is one area that concerns me. Imports to Brazil have always been tightly controlled in order to protect local industries. This strategy may have been effective when Brazil was a struggling third world country, but today Brazil is emerging as an economic powerhouse with international political aspirations.
<br /><br />It is reported by Latin Business News that Brazil has requested that Mexico decrease auto exports to Brazil by 33% or $1.4 billion this year. If Brazil is going to aspire to a position of international leadership, it should be fostering more trade in LATAM. Such an approach to trade would increase its political clout. OBDMATE OM510  
<br /><br />If Brazil were to expand its political influence, especially in LATAM, such an approach would force the U.S. to pay more attention to LATAM. More attention from the U.S. would theoretically foster greater economic development in LATAM and benefit Brazilian exports.

Given the demand for all things SUV, and most things with a BMW badge on them, even a $35,000 crossover that’s slightly smaller than a Toyota Prius v should do brisk business.
<br /><br />For its American debut at the New York Auto Show, BMW freshened the exterior of the X1, matching the more up-to-date look of the new 3-Series, and gave the interior a minor touch-up. Under the hood, BMW will offer two turbocharged engines, a 240-hp four-cylinder and a 300-hp straight six, both tied to an automatic transmission and stop-start fuel savers. The base X1 can be bought as a rear-wheel-drive only setup with a base sticker price of $31,545, with the top all-wheel-drive version priced at $39,345 — when it is issued late this year. MemoScan VAG5053
<br /><br />BMW didn’t announce fuel economy figures, but for the moment the market for mini luxury SUVs consists of the X1, the upcoming Buick Encore and…Mini, whose Countryman comes close to the X1 in size and with some crossover in price. Don’t be surprised if a few more models arrive by next year.

<br /><br />Jaguar says that after 37 years it will build a spiritual successor to its iconic E-Type roadster called, logically enough, the F-Type. On the basic of the C-X16 concept shown last year, Jaguar says the new F-Type will be officially issued late this year and go on sale in 2013. The company also claims that the car will accelerate to 60 mph in less than 5 seconds and achieve a top speed of more than 180 mph.  To further whet our appetites, it provided a few shots showing an F-Type prototype hiding in plain sight.
<br /><br />1961 Jaguar E-Type convertibleThe long-nose E-Type ranks among the greatest cars ever built — one that not only won on racetracks around the world but set a style standard that Jaguar has reached for ever since. In 1996, the Museum of Modern Art in New York added an E-Type to its permanent collection. Benz AK400 key Programmer
<br /><br />Over the years the company has considered building other successors, even showing another F-Type concept in 2002, but years of financial trouble led Jaguar to focus on higher volume, higher profit models. With sales rising under ownership by India’s Tata Motors, Jaguar has enough capital to restore a classic.
