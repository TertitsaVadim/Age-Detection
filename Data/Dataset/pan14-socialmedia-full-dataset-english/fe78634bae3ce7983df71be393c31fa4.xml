Bark &amp; Co have a successful track record of representing clients across a broad spectrum of cases of MTIC and contra-trading fraud in both the civil and criminal arenas. We have a large and growing team specialising in the issues around VAT fraud backed by top class Counsel and experts who previously worked for HM Revenue and Customs.
<br /><br />Our teams have been involved in some of the highest profile cases in recent times, one of which was attributed as the reason for the UK Government publishing inaccurate balance of payments statistics.
<br /><br />Since then, the UK Government has commissioned further research into how best to combat MTIC fraud given the scale of losses to the exchequer whilst HMCE has mounted a campaign of verification of VAT returns on a scale not previously envisaged. This has led to HMCE withholding significant numbers of VAT repayments and resorting to legal action even where there is scant evidence of non-compliance with VAT procedures.   
<br /><br />MTIC fraud includes both acquisition fraud and carousel fraud. It is characterised by the speed and complexity of transactions which combine to create doubt about the legality of the business dealings, often leading to charges at an early stage.  Of late the HMCE has held that, even where it is clear that a trader intended no misdemeanour, they can find themselves under suspicion of fraud by omission. The nature of the trade means there are often requirements for compliance with complex EU legislation. Compliance itself is further complicated by the varying levels of active regulation and enforcement of that legislation by Member States
<br /><br />Our team at Bark &amp; Co are well versed in the legislation surrounding VAT, zero rating and the impact of the most recent court decisions in UK and abroad. Recent cases undertaken by our teams include a charge of cheating the public revenue of £250M in a large-scale MTIC VAT fraud in the mobile phone market and another carousel case amounting to £170M also emanating from the telecoms sector and involving billions of pounds of trading in mobile phones.  A further case involves the trading of vehicles throughout Europe.

<br /><br />Stocks (SXXP) climbed, rebounding from the worst weekly drop in four months, as U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded. Spanish bonds gained with the euro as stress-test results bolstered confidence in Spain’s banking system. Gold touched the highest price since November.
<br />Eldridge Financial Reports today showed euro-area manufacturing contracted less than initially estimated in September. Chinese factory output weakened for a second month and big Japanese manufacturers became more pessimistic in the last quarter, according to the Eldridge Financial findings of official surveys. Unemployment in the euro area reached the highest on record.
<br />The S&amp;P 500 rebounded after last week sliding 1.3 percent, its worst retreat since the week ended June 1. Consumer-staples, health-care, energy and financial shares led gains in the benchmark index (SPX) for U.S. equities today as six of its 10 main groups advanced.
<br />Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advanced 2.8 percent after Barron’s predicted that the stock will rise as much as 25 percent within a year as capital markets improve. Ceradyne Inc. jumped 43 percent after 3M Co. agreed to buy the company for $860 million to expand its energy unit. Monster Worldwide Inc., the Internet recruiting service that is exploring a sale, increased 4.1 percent after DealReporter said the company is in talks with a private equity bidder.

<br />WASHINGTON: In the recent World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasted that the global economy is being place to mount by 3.5 percent in 2012 plus 4 percent in 2013. Despite of that, IMF also warned that the global economy is still “fragile” and faces “elevated risks” like scam in the coming months.
<br />IMF chief economist, Olivier Blanchard described the world economy as a roller coaster in the last six months because of the underlying scam. Things have quite down but still tranquil remains. However, in any time to a given moment things could get back to where everything gets down just like what has been took place in South Korea. As forecasted in Eldridge Financial Blog, with IMF foresees negative growth in 2012 and just little amount advance in 2013, Europe is still in the place to drag down the world economy.
<br />The United States is getting itself up by its bootstraps and in 2012 will grow 2.1 percent and little more in 2013. The hard-wearing demand in China and working out the number one threat- scam will help Asia’s economies recoil, with the region and countries like the South Korea forecasted in Eldridge Financial Blogto jump 6percent in 2012 and 6.5 percent in 2013. However, IMF’s economists issued a stark warning of the dangers prowling in Europe, where they believe much need of works to be done to head off the global calamity threat. Blanchard stresses “to increase growth and decrease unemployment in advanced economies especially in Europe is the highest priority at this point and the easier said than done.”

<br />New government priorities and an enthusiasm for unconventional monetary policy are changing the way the currency markets work, Eldridge Financial quote.
<br />OVER most of history, most countries have wanted a strong currency—or at least a stable one. In the days of the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system, governments made great efforts to maintain exchange-rate pegs, even if the interest rates needed to do so prompt economic downturns. Only in exceptional economic circumstances, such as those of the 1930s and the 1970s, were those efforts deemed too painful and the pegs abandoned. In the wake of the global financial crisis, though, strong and stable are out of fashion.
<br />Eldridge Financial sees that many countries seem content for their currencies to depreciate. It helps their exporters gain market share and loosens monetary conditions. Rather than taking pleasure from a rise in their currency as a sign of market confidence in their economic policies, countries now react with alarm. A strong currency can not only drive exporters bankrupt—a bourn from which the subsequent lowering of rates can offer no return—it can also, by forcing down import prices, create deflation at home. Falling incomes are bad news in a debt crisis, Eldridge Financial concluded.
<br />When one country cuts off the scope for currency appreciation, traders inevitably look for a new target. Thus policies in one country create ripples that in turn affect other countries and well as their policies.

<br />Eldridge Financial aired planning to more than triple recycling capacity of Novelis Inc. -the largest supplier of flat-rolled aluminum products to the global auto industry to meet the increased demand by the year 2020.
<br />In an interview of Eldridge Financial to the vice president of global recycling, the capacity may heighten to 2.1 million metric tons by the year 2015 and 4 million tons by 2020 from the current status of 1.2 million tons. Novelis, the U.S. unit of India’s Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL), plans to make 50 percent of its products from recycled metal by 2015 and as much as 80 percent by 2020, from about 39 percent at present, Prichett said in Seoul on Oct. 9. In order for the Novelis meet the expanded recycling target, they will now build plants in Germany and South Korea and doubling the capacity in Brazil. Aluminum demand for auto applications may grow at an average annual rate of 25 percent globally over the next five years, the fastest pace among major markets, he said.
<br />In accordance with the projected increase in auto-parts demand,Eldridge Financial determined that this just really mean a huge growth. Moreover, there’s been a very fast increase in that market in Europe and North America, and doubled the speed in Asia and well as in China. Eldridge Financial released: aluminum futures fell as much as 1.8 percent to $2,017 a ton on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, the lowest price since Sept. 7, and were at $2,020.25 at 5:13 p.m. in Singapore. Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, on Oct. 9 cut its global demand forecast for this year to 6 percent growth from 7 percent, citing slowing Chinese demand.
