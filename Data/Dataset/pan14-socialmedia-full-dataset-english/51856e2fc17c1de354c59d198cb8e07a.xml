Dr. Henry Monroe says, &quot;every type of substance employed by man as food consists of sugar, starch, oil and glutinous matter mingled with each other in a variety of proportions. They are designed for the help with the animal frame. The glutinous concepts of food fibrine, albumen and casein are employed to create up the construction even though the oil, starch and sugar are chiefly utilised to generate heat inside the body&quot;. <br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wZW5ndWluamVyc2V5c2hvcC5jb20vc2lkbmV5LWNyb3NieS1qZXJzZXk_" target="_blank">Sidney Crosby Jersey</a> <br />Now it's clear that if alcohol  is actually a food, it will be found to include 1  or more of those substances. There must be in it either the nitrogenous elements found chiefly in meats, eggs, milk, vegetables and seeds, out of which animal tissue is constructed and waste repaired or the carbonaceous components found in  body fat, starch and sugar, inside the consumption of which heat and force are evolved. <br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaG9wYmxhY2toYXdramVyc2V5cy5jb20vcGF0cmljay1rYW5lLWplcnNleS1jLTI1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Patrick Kane Jersey</a> <br />&quot;The distinctness of those groups of foods,&quot; says Dr. Hunt,   &quot;and their relations towards the tissue-producing and heat-evolving capacities of man, are so definite and so confirmed by experiments on animals and by manifold tests of scientific, physiological and clinical knowledge, that no  try to discard the classification has prevailed. To draw so straight a line of demarcation as to restrict the 1 entirely to tissue or cell production and the other to heat and force production by way of ordinary combustion and to deny any power of interchangeability under particular demands or amid defective supply of one particular assortment is, certainly, untenable. This isn't going to inside the least invalidate the fact that we're ready to utilize these as ascertained landmarks&quot;. <br /><br />How these substances when taken to the entire body, are assimilated and how they produce force, are well recognized for the chemist and physiologist, who's ready, in the light of well-ascertained laws, to figure out whether or not alcohol does or doesn't possess a food value. For many years, the ablest men within the medical profession have offered this topic the most careful study, and have subjected alcohol to  every identified check and experiment, along with the outcome is that it has been, by frequent consent, excluded from the class of tissue-building foods. &quot;We have never,&quot; says Dr. Hunt, &quot;seen but a single suggestion that it could so act, and this a promiscuous guess. 1 author (Hammond) thinks it possible that it might 'somehow' enter into combination together with the goods of decay in tissues, and 'under selected conditions may yield their nitrogen for the construction of new tissues.' No parallel in organic chemistry, nor any evidence in animal chemistry, may be located to surround this guess with the areola of a doable hypothesis&quot;. <br /><br />Dr. Richardson says: &quot;Alcohol consists of no nitrogen; it has none from the characteristics of structure-building foods; it is incapable of getting  transformed into any of them; it's, consequently, not a meals in any sense of its staying a constructive agent in building up the physique.&quot; Dr. W.B. Carpenter says: &quot;Alcohol can't provide anything that's important towards the true nutrition with the tissues.&quot; Dr. Liebig says: &quot;Beer, wine, spirits, and so on., furnish no component capable of getting into into the composition from the blood, muscular fibre, or any component that is the seat from the principle of lifestyle.&quot; Dr. Hammond, in his Tribune Lectures, in which he advocates the use of alcohol in certain circumstances, says: &quot;It is just not demonstrable that alcohol undergoes conversion into tissue.&quot; Cameron, in his Manuel of Hygiene, says: &quot;There is practically nothing in alcohol with which any component from the physique could be nourished.&quot; Dr. E. Smith, F.R.S., says: &quot;Alcohol just isn't a true meals. It interferes with alimentation.&quot; Dr. T.K. Chambers says: &quot;It is clear that we need to cease to regard alcohol, as in any sense, a food&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Not detecting in this substance,&quot; says Dr. Hunt, &quot;any tissue-making components,  nor in its breaking up any combinations, this kind of as we are in a position to trace within the cell foods, nor any proof either within the knowledge of physiologists or the trials of alimentarians, it isn't fantastic that in it we must uncover neither the expectancy nor the realization of constructive power.&quot; <br /><br />Not obtaining in alcohol something out of which the entire body can be constructed up or its waste supplied, it's subsequent to become examined as to its heat-producing high quality. <br /><br />Production of heat.<br />------------------           <br /><br />&quot;The very first typical check for any force-producing meals,&quot; says Dr. Hunt, &quot;and that to which other foods of that class respond, could be the production of heat in the mixture of oxygen therewith. This heat implies essential force, and it is, in no little degree, a measure of the comparative worth in the so-called respiratory foods. If we examine the fats, the starches as well as the sugars, we are able to trace and estimate the processes by which they evolve heat and are changed into crucial force, and may weigh the capacities of various foods. We discover that the consumption of carbon by union with oxygen will be the law, that heat will be the product, and that the reputable outcome is force, even though the result from the union with the hydrogen from the foods with oxygen is water. If alcohol comes in any way beneath this class of foods, we rightly assume to locate several of the evidences which attach for the hydrocarbons.&quot; <br /><br />What, then, may be the result of experiments within this course' They have been carried out by way of lengthy periods and with the greatest care, by guys in the highest attainments in chemistry and physiology, and the end result is given in these handful of words, by Dr. H.R. Wood, Jr., in his Materia Medica. &quot;No one continues to be ready to detect within the blood any from the ordinary outcomes of its oxidation.&quot; Which is, nobody has been capable to discover that alcohol has undergone combustion, like fat, or starch, or sugar, and so given heat to the physique.  <br /><br />Alcohol and reduction of temperature.                   <br /><br />as an alternative of rising it; and it has even been used in fevers as an anti-pyretic. So uniform has been the testimony of physicians in Europe and America as towards the cooling effects of alcohol, that Dr. Wood says, in his Materia Medica, &quot;that it doesn't seem really worth even though to occupy space having a discussion of the topic.&quot; Liebermeister, one of many most realized contributors to Zeimssen's Cyclopaedia with the Practice of Medicine, 1875, says: &quot;I prolonged given that convinced myself, by direct experiments, that alcohol, even in comparatively big doses, will not elevate the temperature of the physique in either properly or sick folks.&quot; So effectively had this grow to be known to Arctic voyagers, that, even just before physiologists had demonstrated the fact that alcohol diminished, as a substitute of escalating, the temperature of the entire body, they had realized that spirits lessened their energy to withstand extreme cold. &quot;In the Northern areas,&quot; says Edward Smith, &quot;it was proved that the complete exclusion of spirits was required, to be able to retain heat underneath these unfavorable conditions.&quot; <br /><br />Alcohol doesn't make you sturdy.                 <br /><br />If alcohol doesn't include tissue-building material, nor give heat towards the body, it can not potentially add to its strength. &quot;Every sort of power an animal can make,&quot; says Dr. G. Budd, F.R.S., &quot;the mechanical power in the muscles, the chemical (or digestive) power from the abdomen, the intellectual energy in the brain accumulates via the nutrition from the organ on which it depends.&quot; Dr. F.R. Lees, of Edinburgh, right after discussing the query, and educing proof, remarks: &quot;From the very nature of issues, it's going to now be seen how not possible it's that alcohol could be strengthening meals of either kind. Since it cannot turn into a portion in the physique, it can not consequently contribute to its cohesive, natural strength, or fixed energy; and, since it comes out of the entire body just as it went in, it can not, by its decomposition, produce heat force.&quot; <br /><br />Sir Benjamin Brodie says: &quot;Stimulants don't develop nervous energy; they simply allow you, because it were, to  use up  that that is left, then they leave you more in need to have of rest than just before.&quot; <br /><br />Baron Liebig, so far back as 1843, in his &quot;Animal Chemistry,&quot; pointed out the fallacy of alcohol generating energy. He says: &quot;The circulation will seem accelerated at the cost of the force readily available for voluntary movement, but with out the production of a better amount of mechanical force.&quot; In his later on &quot;Letters,&quot; he once more says: &quot;Wine is fairly superfluous to man, it really is constantly followed from the expenditure of power&quot; whereas, the actual function of food is always to give energy. He adds: &quot;These drinks promote the adjust of matter within the physique, and are, consequently, attended by an inward loss of power, which ceases to become productive, simply because it's not employed in overcoming outward difficulties i.e., in operating.&quot; In other words, this fantastic chemist asserts that alcohol abstracts the energy with the system from performing helpful function within the area or workshop, in order to cleanse the house in the defilement of alcohol itself. <br /><br />The late Dr. W. Brinton, Doctor to St. Thomas', in his wonderful function on Dietetics, says: &quot;Careful observation leaves small doubt that a moderate dose of beer or wine would, in most cases, at as soon as diminish the optimum weight which a healthy particular person could lift. Psychological acuteness, accuracy of perception and delicacy of the senses are all so far opposed by alcohol, as that the maximum efforts of each and every are incompatible with the ingestion of any moderate quantity of fermented liquid. A single glass will frequently suffice to take the edge off each thoughts and body, and to reduce their capability to a thing beneath their perfection of perform.&quot; <br /><br />Dr. F.R. Lees, F.S.A., writing on the topic of alcohol like a meals, tends to make the following quotation from an essay on &quot;Stimulating Drinks,&quot; published by Dr. H.R. Madden, as prolonged ago as 1847: &quot;Alcohol is not the organic stimulus to any of our organs, and hence, functions performed in consequence of its application, tend to debilitate the organ acted on. <br /><br />Alcohol is incapable of becoming assimilated or converted into any natural proximate principle, and hence, can't be regarded nutritious. <br /><br />The strength knowledgeable soon after the use of alcohol just isn't new strength extra for the technique, but is manifested by calling into physical exercise the nervous energy pre-existing. <br /><br />The ultimate exhausting results of alcohol, owing to its stimulant properties, make an unnatural susceptibility to morbid action in all of the organs, and this, with all the plethora superinduced, becomes a fertile supply of disease. <br /><br />Someone who habitually exerts himself to this kind of an extent as to need the every day use of stimulants to ward off exhaustion, might be compared to a machine operating beneath higher pressure. He will turn out to be significantly much more obnoxious towards the causes of disease, and can definitely break down sooner than he would have performed underneath a lot more favorable circumstances. <br /><br />The a lot more regularly alcohol is had recourse to for the objective of overcoming emotions of debility, the far more it'll be needed, and by constant repetition a period is at length reached when it cannot be foregone, unless of course reaction is concurrently brought about by a temporary complete change with the habits of life. <br /><br />Driven towards the wall.<br /><br />Not locating that alcohol possesses any direct alimentary worth, the medical advocates of its use happen to be driven towards the assumption that it's a sort of secondary food, in that it has the energy to delay the metamorphosis of tissue. &quot;By the metamorphosis of tissue is meant,&quot; says Dr. Hunt, &quot;that transform which is constantly going on in the program which requires a continual disintegration of material; a breaking up and avoiding of that which can be no longer aliment, producing room for that new provide that's to sustain life.&quot; An additional medical writer, in referring to this metamorphosis, says: &quot;The relevance of this method for the servicing of lifestyle is readily shown from the injurious effects which comply with upon its disturbance. In the event the discharge from the excrementitious substances be in any way impeded or suspended, these substances accumulate both inside the blood or tissues, or each. In consequence of this retention and accumulation they grow to be poisonous, and rapidly generate a derangement from the crucial functions. Their influence is principally exerted on the nervous program, through which they make most regular irritability, disturbance in the special senses, delirium, insensibility, coma, and eventually, death.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;This description,&quot; remarks Dr. Hunt, &quot;seems practically meant for alcohol.&quot; He then says: &quot;To claim alcohol as a meals because it delays the metamorphosis of tissue, would be to claim that it in some way suspends the standard conduct from the laws of assimilation and nutrition, of waste and repair. A major advocate of alcohol (Hammond) therefore illustrates it: 'Alcohol retards the destruction with the tissues. By this destruction, force is generated, muscle tissues contract, thoughts are formulated, organs secrete and excrete.' In other words, alcohol interferes with all these. No wonder the writer 'is not clear' how it does this, and we are not clear how this kind of delayed metamorphosis recuperates.  <br /><br />Not an originator of important force.<br /><br />that's not recognized to possess any from the typical energy of foods, and use it on the double assumption that it delays metamorphosis of tissue, and that this kind of delay is conservative of health, would be to pass outdoors with the bounds of science in to the land of remote possibilities, and confer the title of adjuster upon an agent whose agency is itself doubtful.  <br /><br />Obtaining failed to identify alcohol like a nitrogenous or non-nitrogenous food, not getting located it amenable to any of the evidences by which the food-force of aliments is generally measured, it will not do for us to talk of advantage by delay of regressive metamorphosis unless of course this kind of procedure is accompanied with one thing evidential with the simple fact something scientifically descriptive of its mode of accomplishment in the situation at hand, and unless it really is shown to become practically desirable for alimentation. <br /><br />There might be no doubt that alcohol does lead to  defects  within the processes of elimination that are normal to the wholesome entire body and which even in disease are typically conservative of well being.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JvbmV0dG9jamVyc2V5MzIuamlnc3kuY29tL2VudHJpZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9hbGNvaG9sLWhhcy1uby1mb29kLXZhbHVl" target="_blank">ALCOHOL HAS NO  Meals Value. </a>
