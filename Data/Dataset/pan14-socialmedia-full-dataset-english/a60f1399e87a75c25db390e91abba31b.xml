<br />he went out drinking last nite, and when he came in.. say around 3am... he thought in his pissed state that it'd be a good idea to wake me up on numerous occassions... first he came to tell me that he had bought the cat a tin of kitty kat home, then to tell me my mum was still at work, then to tell me he was taking the dogs for a walk and finally he woke me up, getting out of bed to go throw his guts up <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />. as you can imagine i was not at all interested as i was half dead. but anyway, wen i finnally woke of my own accord this morning, i found that the cat food wasn't even kitty kat but felix, i promptly proceded in waking him up to tell him the cat was ginger, waited till he was asleep again and then woke him to tell him my mum had gone out and after that i made do with beating him with the pillow.lol.
<br />even funnier than that..... my mum go up this morning dying for a pee, as you do, she got in the bathroom and dicovered the toilet was covered in sick! deciding that she'd have peed herself by time she cleaned it, she tried to hover over the loo while peeing, and ended up peeing all over her legs and the floor, so ended up having to clean both the pee and the sick. lmfao

<br />well anyway, i just felt like tellin someone about it and now i have so...bye.

<br />well, my poor cat should be home tomorro, he has a big metal brace thingy on one leg, holding the pins in place, the poor thing's been on morphine n ketamine for the past 4 days, i hope he ain't drug dependent by the time he gets better. lol.
<br />well, my nob of a boyf is gonna get beats wen he gets home, he 'nipped' to his mums (a 10 min walk) about 4.30, leaving me with his phone as i was waitin on a call from the vets, he obviously thought he was bein smart, but then he didn't bank on his lil bro comin up n tellin me he'd left his mum's at 6, i think a serious rant followed by a bit of silent treatment is in order, at least just till he's beggin for mercy.....i think the spliffs kicking in now, i was angrier about this earlier than i am now. lol
<br />anyway thats about all i can think of for now so...tata <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
