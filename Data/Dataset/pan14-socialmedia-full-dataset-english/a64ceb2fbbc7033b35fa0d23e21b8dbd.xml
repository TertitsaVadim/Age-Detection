It's time to discard the idea, especially this season where suited style is taking a turn for the fun and exciting. What you have to see is that looking smart and dressed up never has to mean staid and dreary. Stock up on the season's new stuff and you'll be in for a very colorful ride.Bright Shirts Make Bold StatementsThe fashion education of every man starts with dad, who dons a white or sky blue shirt with a patterned tie each and every weekday morning. From that ritual comes a standard formula of style: plain shirt plus random tie equals office hours. The practice has been unraveling in the past few seasons, and a new trend is ripe for picking this spring.Make your own 21st century style statement with a bright shirt. Pass on the pastels and try a shirt with a more eye-catching color. Oranges and reds are particularly effective for this trend, but violets and greens work just as well. If you feel out of your depths with a too bright shade, look for a hue that's slightly more washed out. As long as you don't come too near to pastels, you keep yourself well away from Dad territory.Contrast is the secret ingredient that will make such an unusual piece work. Unless you want to achieve a Vegas-y effect, a strong and grounded necktie is the best complement to a vibrant shirt. Whether it's for the office or the after-five cocktail, a necktie must always, always stand out against the shirt and suit.Accessories Make the ManThere are times when a suited outfit isn't entirely about the suit. It's entirely possible for a single piece to upstage the two- or three-piece institution and take the limelight. In this case, it will be white shoes that will do the upstaging.Like with the solid neckties on bright shirts, it's the contrast that makes this combo seem so cool. Against the typical suit palette of somber grays, businesslike blacks and strict navy, white provides a cool and very spring-appropriate counterpoint. Wearing a pair of shoes in a non-formal material - bucks instead of leather wingtips, for example - is very nonconformist yet unfailingly stylish.Note that a pair of white shoes almost always results in a more relaxed looking outfit. It's a risky proposition for the office, so you may want to test it during Casual Friday first. If the boss and coworkers don't seem to mind, only then can you go the whole nine yards.Printed PleasantriesFew things say spring like a good print, a lighter mood from the heavy wools and tweeds from winter. There's more than one way to skin the printed cat, and any one of them would be a good idea to liven up your style this spring.A printed shirt would probably be the easiest way to pick up the trend. Plaids and checks, after all, have been in men's fashion since time immemorial. You can even get extra style points by choosing a bright and bold color incorporated in the pattern. The only caveat is that you have to keep the rest of your outfit simple: a simple necktie, suit and shoes. A print on your suit is a more daring and dandyish way of doing it. The rules are just the same: use a bold print, but keep the rest of your look understated.Printed ties are another option, especially now that lighter cotton ties are coming into the spotlight. A slimmer profile and the weightlessness create a lighter and more laid back feel that's just perfect for the season. The prints usually come in plaids or checks, and will work best when the ground is a dark color and the shirt is in some light pastel.fmwqy120106

There is a reason that these cuts and styles have been a main stay for decades. Through the years we have seen a lot of trends come and go, from the super slime details of the 50's to the extra wide lapels of the 70's and the big &quot;power&quot; shoulders of the 80's. Through it all the classics have remained constant and have always been a wise investment.Here are the top three reasons to go with a trad suit rather than the &quot;suit of the day&quot;.1. Trad does not go out of style. Yves Saint Laurent said it best- &quot; Fashions fade but style is eternal&quot; and when it comes to mens suits nothing is truer than this. The suit worn by Sean Connery in the original James Bond film is every bit as classic and timeless as the day he wore it 40+ years ago.2. Trad is both trendy and classic. Learning how to carry a Trad wardrobe can really make you look fashionable effortlessly. Fashion is the art of creating a stylish look with out trying. Classic is the art of wearing timeless looks. Trad is all that rolled up into one.3. Trad can make you look more powerful. Think about the last time you saw a very &quot;slick&quot; looking guy hold a position of power? That rarely happens. Leave fashion for the club kids and the bar scene and wear trad for the board room.Bottom line is if you are looking for a great suit that will carry into your career for years to come, classic traditional tailoring is a very sound investment that will pay dividends for many years. It may seem a little old fashioned but wear it consistently and it will create an air of stylishness that only great clothing can deliver.fmwqy120106

Every businessman in the corporate world understands the importance of looking good for the sake of the clients, and every career person knows that a matching suit and tie can give one a good break. Putting on the power suit For those going to a job interview, it's very important to keep your business suit formal but not too flashy. Dressing up in a suit with solid colours will tell the interviewer that you are serious about getting the job and that you're confident that you can get the job done. The power suit is an especially important piece of clothing for people trying to land a high-paying job. The power suit implies that you are to be taken seriously, that you take pride in your appearance--which goes the same for your work ethic--and that you are a very efficient person. These descriptions match the power suit, which is why many people get hired when they wear this. But what is a power suit, you may ask? Power suits are usually in dark shades of charcoal, blue, or a very dark shade of brown. Power suits have broad shoulders and sharp edges that really imply seriousness from the person wearing it. In fact, this attire can be intimidating, since it is often associated with demanding CEOs and managers. Matching a tie with the suit Most men still find it hard to get a tie that can match the suit they are wearing, but it's actually easy to find ties to match a power suit. Also, there are a few guidelines to keep in mind: Start with the suit, then work your way to the details. It's easier to start with the largest piece of your clothing then work your way down to the smallest instead of going the other way around. When you've chosen the suit and the shirt you want to wear, then it's time to look for a tie that will match. If your suit is a dark grey one, which is quite common for first-time users of the power suit, almost any color of a tie can be a match. A striped tie is also easy to match with these kinds of suits. A striped necktie can even out the sharp edges of a power suit so you won't look too intimidating. If you're looking for a good brand of necktie, there are a lot out there. Fendi, Vivienne Westwood, DKNY, and Paul Smith are just some of the brands that carry very exquisite ties, whether they are striped ties or solid-colored ones. Yellow ties are good for power suits. While yellow isn't usually such a good color to go with your pants, shoes or overall look, a yellow nectie can work wonders for power suits. In the movie &quot;The Kid,&quot; Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) arrived at his office one day with his secretary, Janet (Lily Tomlin), telling him on the cell phone what tie he was wearing before she even saw him. She said that he wanted to feel extra powerful today, so he must be wearing his yellow tie to exude that feeling. True enough, when he approached his secretary, he was wearing his yellow tie. So if you want to increase your chances of getting into the company that you want, take these nuggets of wisdom into consideration and apply them to your attire before you head out for a job interview or try to close that deal. If they worked for so many others, they can work for you too.fmwqy120106

Everything from high school graduation to church can be attended in pants with a coordinating button-down shirt and tie. However, once you've crossed over into the adult world, you will need a suit for job interviews, business functions, weddings, and funerals. If you are employed in an industry that does not expect daily dress-wear, a quintessential suit will serve for those few occasions where you'll need one. But what should you look for in a suit? Fit, quality, and accessories are all essential to choosing a smart suit.An ill-fitting suit is not only uncomfortable, but it looks unprofessional. Be sure that the shoulders of the jacket are padded to fit your frame and that the vents allow freedom of movement. Slender to average men may choose a single-breasted suit with one or two buttons, whereas a larger man may find a double-breasted suit more flattering. Avoid pleats in the trousers, as this has been out of fashion for quite some time. Finally make sure that both sleeve and pants cuffs are long enough. Nothing looks worse than exposed wrists or ankles.Quality is also important. Be sure to choose wool or a wool blend if you reside in a four-season climate. Gentlemen from the south may want to choose linen. In either case, do not purchase polyester, as the seat of the trousers and the back of the jacket quickly becomes shiny and will appear cheap.Additionally, accessories show attention to detail. Be sure that if you have tattoos, wear a t-shirt underneath your dress shirt to avoid them showing through. Make sure the cuffs of your shirt extend a quarter-inch below the cuffs of your jacket. If you wear cuff links, choose a simple, elegant design. Finally, avoid ties that clash or have overly-busy patterns.By following these simple guidelines, you will be able to choose a suit that meets your needs for special occasions. Keep fit, quality, and accessories in mind when making you selections, and your suit will last for years to come. Hopefully, these tips will come in handy the next time you're looking at suits for men. Happy shopping!fmwqy120201

There are different types of wet suits but if you want the perfect attire for water sports and swimming, go for surf-style wet suits. They will allow you to move freely and span through different water temperatures. Before you buy one, it is highly advised that you ask recommendations from your dive instructor.1. Study thickness. You need to understand the relationship between thickness and body warmth of the suits. The thickness is measured through millimeters. If youe used to diving to waters that about 50 to 60 degrees, pick a 4-3 full suit. Opt for 4 mm thickness to ensure utmost protection. If you wish to go to even lower temperature, pick a 5-mm hooded suit.2. Determine your needs. Before buying, it is very important that you determine the type of suit that you need. One with cut-off arms and legs allows you to move freely. On the other hand, if you plan to go through cold water, full suits extend to ankles and wrists will be your best choice. Paddlers and scuba divers opt for suits with full legs but no arms.3. Check the seams. If you want warmer suits, invest on pieces that have profound construction. Seams that have high quality feature edges that are carefully glued and sewn into place. Their material meet flush and they are also covered by a strip of cloth. Low quality seams may not be as costly but they have small humps and come with exposed stitching.4. Check out different brands. To get the best piece, try different brands sold locally and even internationally. Go for ones that come with a snug fit and do not constrict breathing and movement. Bear in mind that wet suits expand with use so avoid buying ones that are already loose at first try.5. Determine your budget. Your budget will have to depend on a wide range of factors. The biggest factor to consider is frequency of use. The cheapest suits can range between $60 to 100 while expensive ones can cost up to $350.Buying a wet suit may be quite hefty but if it helps you achieve the ltimate beach fun?that you need, then why restrain yourself from buying one?

The suit may be a readymade one or from the custom suits section, but it is needed in every man's clothing collection.

Her trousseau and her wardrobe is what everyone talked about. Her wedding gown, her make- up, her hair, her shoes and her jewelry were the talking point. But not anymore. Some points have to be kept in mind while deciding on the wedding suit for the groom.Fabric: When shopping for the wedding suit, or the fabric, in case you are planning to get it tailored, checking the material first is very important. Fabric of wool or wool finish is the ideal choice, and polyester and linen comes next. It is best to go for the wrinkle free varieties as you will be in that suit for almost the entire day and you do not want to look shaggy at the adies tailors party. Next, you should also consider the weather and the humidity of the location where the wedding is to take place, especially if you are planning to have an open air wedding, like on the beach. In that case, you will want the suit to have a higher percentage of cotton.Color: Next is the color, as it should of course match your complexion and for those who want to play it safe, basic black or Tailors UK is preferred. In case you want to experiment, then you should take into account the detailing of the theme of the wedding. You should also keep in mind if the wedding is taking place in daylight or at sunset, and it is best to go for lighter shades in the morning and darker shades are more appropriate for the evening. Styling: If you are having a traditional wedding, then you can go for a traditional wedding suit, complete with a double waist coast, and a bow tie. Or else, a well- fitted suit with a tie is just fine. It is best to have the color of the shirt in contrast to the suit for maximum effect. Lastly, the fit should be perfect, flattering the groom's body. A most well- cut and elegant suit will look shabby if not fitted properly. Accessories: The suit can be accessorized with cufflinks, tie- pins, an elegant watch, a good leather belt and an elegant pair of shoes. Swarovski embedded cufflinks and tie- pins are very popular with men now. Nowadays the groom gets equal attention and a lot of emphasis is laid on the groom's suit, almost similar to that of the bride's wedding gown. So it would be wrong to assume that just about any suit for the wedding will do.fmwqy120210

It was Charles 2 who set up a standard dress in 1666 for men appearing in the English court. They had to wear a long coat, a waistcoat, a cravat, a wig, knee breeches and a hat. This was considered a proper business dressing. From 1666 till date you can find a dramatic change in Men business suits style. Men suit coats and pants have experienced several variations in cuts, but the combination remains true. For formal occasions the standard business clothing includes jacket and pants. During World War 2 there were cloth shortages due to which men suits didn include vests. This trend was never fully picked back up after the war was over. There are several styles of men business suits. The most famous are Double-breasted, Single breasted, British suits, Italian, American and Contemporary suits. Double breasted suits have two rows of buttons while single breasted suits only have one row of button running down the front of the suit jacket. Italian suits only have padded shoulders and no vent and tapered sides. American suits have minimum tapered sides and one walking vent. The cuffs of most men? suits feature three or four buttons. When youe planning to buy a business suit remember certain things in mind. Choose the right fabric, cut and pieces when buying a suit. One of the key factors in selecting a suit is the fabric it is made up of. The color of your suit is also very important. Color is a key point when choosing your fabric and knowing your color ahead of time will help you narrows down your specific fabric choice. Standard navy suit is considered the most appropriate color for any occasion either social or formal. When choosing the fabric for your suit, go in for worsted wool. This is the best quality, and the most durable suit fabric. Wool fabric in suits is going to say on the label tweed, flannel or worsted wool. If the word twisted is printed on the label it simply refers to how many times the yarn or the wool was twisted. If wool is twisted higher number of times it indicates a higher quality fabric. The last thing you should do when examining your suit fabric is to crumple it. The fabric should bounce back and not wrinkle. Wool fabric is considered very expensive, so if it does not go well along with your budget, look for a wool blend to accommodate the price difference. Avoid buying polyester fabric as they give a cheap look and do not breathe well. If you see certain names on the label like micro fibers and Teflon try avoiding buying them. Cut also plays an important role when buying a Men? suit. There are three types of suit cuts. First being American cut, second one full cut and the last one being European cut. The key to your decisions regarding what pants you choose will be dependent entirely on what look you are going for. If you want something formal, go in for pleats in the front. If you want a thinner look, you can opt for a flat panel front. Whether or not you will have cuffs again depends on your look. Make sure that your pants should sit comfortably on the waist, and not on the hips. A two or three button jacket is good, and you always want to leave the bottom button undone. Budget and Body type also determines what suit you can buy. A double breasted suit is going to cost a little bit more, but is better for some body types than others. The only thing you need to worry about with this is to have a belt that is going to match the shoes you intend to wear. Leather is the preferred material here, and matching the colors is the key to good accessorizing. These are your suit buying basics. fmwqy120210

There seems to be a certain air of nostalgia to wearing them. We also do not have to mention the high-fashion masters who have added cotton suits to their collections. Being and getting along in a cotton mens suit is something not hard to love. The first best thing about cotton suits is that they are such cool substitutes to summer weight wools. Most of the shirts in a man's wardrobe blends with it; they can be worn with, say, a vintage print tee-shirt as well as a collared one. Round out this casual, urban look with a pair of elite-looking dress shoes or sneakers. What's good to know too is that the cotton suits available now are way hippier and better constructed. Mens suits now made of cotton are a lot more suited for the office or an evening out vis-a-vis what in years past. For the time being, if you are in the process of amassing a functional wardrobe, you can't go wrong in going for for suit fabrics like worsted wools. Those watching the industry concur how essential cotton suiting is as a necessity in a spring/ summer collection. From preppy to edgy, its at home in most mens trend themes. Clueless as to what to wear to a Sunday power brunch? Do try a khaki-colored, twill suit paired with a bright shirt, or if sallying forth downtown this evening, then you can bet on a slim-fit mens suit jacket with drainpipe-slim jeans and a T-shirt with a not too loud color. So what are good style pointers for handling cotton mens suits? Catch them in the cooler hues of blue and gray, as well as tan. Warm climes mean loosely woven fabrics, which leads us to wool fresco, mohair and wool blends. I believe the variety of suits that maximize temperature control with excellent durabilty are the so-called ten ounce versions. Though cooler to wear, they are however harder to come by. There are also some things about cotton mens suits that need to be avoided. A case in point are tropical weight cloth of 7-8 ounce fabric. Suits made from these lead to annoyances like wrinkling, reduced durability, and a warmer feeling due to a lack of loose weave which would have allowed air circulation. A further downside to tropical wool is its ubiquity, given that it is so inexpensive than heavier cloth of the same quality. The full lining that goes with a cotton suit is a short term comfort, since it actually does not help in air circulation. And now, a last word of caution on style. Do not fret so much if your cotton mens suit get wrinkly. Linen will really rumple, one way or another. Make the most out of it by not minding if you look like you slept in your suit.
