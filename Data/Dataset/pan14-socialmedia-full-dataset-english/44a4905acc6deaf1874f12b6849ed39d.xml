''I think I'll be more anxious than nervous. When you're anxious you can't wait to go succeed. You just gotta go out and play the game. It'll be an eye-opening experience and I look forward to it.''<br />The expectations are high for Griffin, for whom the Redskins (No. 25 in the AP Pro32) traded three first-round picks and a second-rounder to St. Louis to move up four spots and draft second overall in April.<br />Coach Mike Shanahan quickly anointed the 22-year-old Heisman Trophy winner from Baylor the starter and the face of the franchise, one that started 21 quarterbacks the past 19 seasons while only reaching the playoffs three times.<br />''I don't ever shy away from expectations or people trying to put pressure on me to be great,'' Griffin said.<br />Shanahan likes that confidence in his rookie quarterback.<br />''You want people to believe in themselves,'' said Shanahan, who won two Super Bowls in Denver with Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and another as San Francisco's offensive coordinator with Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young.<br />''You want them to have that air of arrogance that they are the best at what they do. Usually the great ones do have that confidence level.''<br />Similar to Griffin, Washington backup quarterback Rex Grossman was a first-round pick, but he was under a lot less pressure in his rookie summer of 2003 as Chicago's third-stringer.<br />''It's a different mindset for Robert,'' Grossman said. ''He's been through a lot more to this point than I had been when I was a rookie. He has a ton of reps. I wasn't getting many reps. I was in awe of where I was and I was very excited about it. He's very confident.<br />''I think he's going to have some nerves, but I think he feels pretty good about what's going to happen. It's not just another game. You're always going to remember your first preseason game just like you'll remember your first start, every single play, so enjoy it.''<br />Grossman and the Bears enjoyed a 20-18 victory over Indianapolis in his preseason debut.<br />However, Heath Shuler, the third overall choice in 1994 and the only quarterback besides Griffin whom the Redskins have chosen in the top 10 in decades, signed just four days before his preseason opener at Buffalo and completed just four of 10 passes with an interception in a 13-11 defeat.<br />''We had more of a West Coast offense in college and now I was running the seven-step drop,'' said Shuler, now a Democratic Congressman from North Carolina.<br />''It would be like putting Rex in the wishbone in terms of how big a change it was for me, but I never got that nervous before games so I wasn't that nervous for that game either. Robert will physically be able to do the things that he's always done, but it needs to become a reaction instead of him thinking, 'If I don't get my foot in the exact right place, when they watch film, they're gonna be all over me.' Just throw the ball from point A to point B.''<br />Notes: Griffin's task in Buffalo might have become more complicated when right guard Chris Chester suffered what was called a mild left ankle sprain during Monday's practice. Washington is already minus left guard Kory Lichtensteiger, who had his left knee scoped a week ago, and right tackle Jammal Brown, who's on the physically unable to perform list with a chronically ailing left hip. Fullback Darrel Young (hamstring) and receiver Lance Lewis (groin) remain sidelined. . Mark Rypien, who earned MVP honors in quarterbacking the Redskins to their most recent Super Bowl victory, attended Monday's walk-through.

An introductory news conference will be held once the contract is signed, but scheduling conflicts mean that is unlikely to happen this week.<br /><br />Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but there is no doubt that Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor had to dig deep into his billionaire pocketbook to land a coach who is eighth on the career victories list. The 65-year-old Adelman is 945-616 in 20 seasons as coach of the Trail Blazers, Kings, Warriors and Rockets.<br />Adelman and the Rockets parted ways in April after his four-year, $16. 25 million contract expired. It likely took quite a bit more to convince a coach who has led a team to the playoffs in 16 of his 20 seasons on the bench to take over a young group that is 32-132 in the past two years.<br /><br />In doing so, Taylor delivered an emphatic statement to any fans who may have doubted his commitment to getting things turned around in Minnesota, especially considering he still owes the fired Kurt Rambis $4 million over the final two years of his contract.<br /><br />Adelman led the Blazers to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992 and has gained a reputation over two decades in the league as a coach who gets the most out of the roster he’s given.<br /><br />He replaces Rambis, who was given just two years as president of basketball operations David Kahn’s first coaching hire.<br /><br />Kahn clashed with Rambis over the team’s pace of play, pushing for a faster, more free-flowing game while Rambis insisted that the players were too young to handle such responsibility.<br /><br />Now it will be up to Adelman to try to harness the energy of the youngest team in the league and get the players to focus on being more consistent and professional night-in and night-out.<br /><br />He has a promising nucleus to work with in All-Star forward Kevin Love, No. 2 overall draft choice Derrick Williams, Spanish import Ricky Rubio and gifted scorer Michael Beasley.<br /><br />So the question becomes, does Adelman have the patience to teach Rubio the NBA game, put up with Beasley’s hijinks both on and off the court and figure out a way to find enough playing time for Williams, Beasley, Wes Johnson<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGVyLWNoaW5hLmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLW5iYS1qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjVfOTkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a> and Martell Webster, all of whom have similar skill sets?<br /><br />Like most coaches, Adelman has enjoyed his greatest successes on veteran-laden teams. And at 65, conventional wisdom was that he would wait for a job that included a more experienced roster who was considered closer to contending for the championship that has eluded him all these years.<br /><br />But he has a good relationship with Love, the face of the franchise who played high school ball with Adelman’s son in Oregon. The versatile power forward seems to be an ideal fit for the high post in Adelman’s offense, which has utilized nifty-passing, sharp-shooting big men like Vlade Divac, Chris Webber and Jerome Kersey to great effect.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Adelman will press to add a veteran or two once the lockout is lifted-hard-nosed Houston forward Chuck Hayes, perhaps? -to show the young pups how to be pros.<br /><br />The Timberwolves are expected to have a decent amount of cap space to make that happen, depending on what the next collective bargaining agreement looks like.<br /><br />So that, combined with Taylor’s hard push, convinced Adelman to jump on board.

That's due to the fact I completely think they're the team greatest capable to take a tournament to the region the soonest. Nevertheless, to carry out that, these people really must be permitted to perform, as well as based on the newest post by means of Joseph Goodman of the Miami Herald, that's in increasingly more threat of not taking place quickly.<br /><br />As Goodman informs it, reviews are appearing, which includes this one in the New York Daily Reports, the NBA is placed to cancel matches through November. TWENTY-EIGHT due to the impasse in the speaks between the proprietors as well as gamers attempting to achieve a fresh Group Bargaining Contract (CBA).<br />With the lockout achieving its 117th day time on Tues, Oct. TWENTY-FIVE the NBA has named off the initial fourteen days of the 2011-12 period and it is seeking as though it is a carried out deal they will be eliminating 2 more weeks unless some thing surprising occurs quickly. Which means presently there defintely won't be numerous basketball enthusiasts who will genuinely have a lot to offer thanks for this forthcoming Thanksgiving; as well as I'm going to be among those grumbling over our poultry as well as padding.<br /><br />Exactly what the majority of enthusiasts wish to perform is things NBA commissioner David Stern as well as all the rest of the stars in this misfortune becoming performed out on the world stage into a cage and also have all of them proceed at it; teeth as well as toe nail. Nevertheless, we are trapped with passively sitting down on the sidelines viewing the melodrama perform out; understanding there is nothing we could do to impact any modifications ourself. In short; we're weak.<br /><br />Being a enthusiast of the Heat I'm especially hopeless, understanding as I carry out the Miami team composed of LeBron James<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZGlkYXNuaWtlc2hvZS5jb20vYWRpZGFzLWJhc2tldGJhbGwtYy0xODYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a>, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh yet others is ready to create another perform at the Finals as well as an NBA subject. Yet, regardless of exactly how gifted the Heat team is, if there are no matches to perform, there are no matches to earn.<br /><br />As Goodman further reviews, at concern in this entire clutter are 2 major issues. The first is the proprietors need these people get a 50-50 divided of all Basketball Related Income (BRI). The final CBA incorporated a divided of 57-43 favoring the gamers, as well as Stern as well as the proprietors have been determined they'll accept nothing less than 50 % on this occasion.<br /><br />Nevertheless, that's a non-starter in the discussions so far as union leader Billy Hunter as well as the gamers are worried. These people are not prepared to give that much of the cash they have been generating simply to placate the proprietors, who're utilizing phony statements of losing profits to strengthen their own demands. The gamers aren't silly, as well as they all are definitely conscious of the Times' reveal concerning the NBA's ridiculous statements of low income. To think they'd give hundreds of millions of bucks due to the fact the proprietors would like it is the height of foolishness.<br /><br />The other concern at perform here is the salary-cap. The proprietors desire a tough limit like the NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE, while the gamers wish to keep up with the soft limit currently in position. There are definitely methods to discover a middle ground on that concern, but once again, it is not actually likely to be talked about critically if the 50-50 divided of BRI continues to be the chief desire of Stern and the proprietors.<br /><br />I do not know how all of this will perform out ultimately. Nevertheless, I've the actual mistrust the gamers are likely to push the proprietors hands in this. In my opinion Stern and the proprietors, thinking they could prevail in their machinations simply by sustaining the lie long sufficient, will perhaps cancel the whole 2011-12 period, however that ultimately they will cave. I believe they will try this once they lastly recognize the gamers themselves will not give in to their crazy needs.<br /><br />These people might have been able to escape with the strategies as well as inaccurate measures previously due to the fact back then presently there was not a real prolific utilization of the web. Nevertheless, these days these people encounter an onslaught from those ready to reveal their deceit at every switch as well as submit tale following tale about it.<br /><br />I just desire Stern as well as his cronies might arrived at the conclusion they will shed this match soon enough, as well as capitulate on their own. For, until these people perform, I could just dream of viewing my favorite Miami Heat take to the hardwood; as well as there's nothing I'd like more right now.<br /><br />Match On!

Manning worked out for the Tennessee Titans on Saturday and it appears he will now choose between them, San francisco and the Denver Broncos.<br />Have the 49ers done enough already to entice him, and show they’re aiming for another shot at the Super Bowl this season?<br /><br />Agent Drew Rosenhaus confirmed Saturday night that Manningham, the former New york giants wideout, had reached a deal with the 49ers, who lost in  overtime of the NFC championship game to Manningham and the eventual Super Bowl champions at Candlestick Park on Jan. 22.<br /><br />Manningham caught a 17-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning with 8: 34 remaining in regulation of the NFC title game to help New york reach the Super  Bowl.<br /><br />He had five more receptions for 73 yards in the Giants’ 21-17 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots, including an over-the-shoulder 38-yard  catch between two defenders on which he managed to stay inbounds to start the game-winning, 88-yard touchdown drive.<br /><br />The 25-year-old Manningham had 39 catches for 523 yards and four touchdowns total last year in his fourth NFL season.<br /><br />Manningham will join an upgraded receiving corps that also includes Moss, who signed a one-year contract Monday, and Michael Crabtree, the team’s 10th  overall pick in the 2009 draft out of Texas Tech who had 72 receptions for 874 yards and four touchdowns in 2011.<br /><br />“It’s going down. Mario Manningham signs with 49ers. This is a sick WR squad. It’s going to be crazy on the Offensive side of the ball, ” tweeted  defensive lineman Ricky Jean Francois.<br /><br />The 49ers, who ended an eight-year playoff drought in Harbaugh’s first season of 2011, also will return their entire starting defensive 11 after  bringing back cornerback Carlos Rogers on a $31. 3 million, four-year deal this week. So, that too could be attractive to Peyton Manning, even though  there’s speculation he would prefer to stay in the AFC and not have to regularly face off with his younger brother.<br /><br />Smith had been expected to re-sign with the 49ers and acknowledged he was weighing a three-year contract offer—but that all might have changed in a  matter of a few days once Manning entered the 49ers’ picture. The San francisco Chronicle reported on its Web site Saturday, citing a league source,  that Smith was considering changing agents from Tom Condon, who also represents Manning.<br /><br />An e-mail to 49ers CEO Jed York, Smith and agents at CAA Sports went unreturned Saturday.

The Hawks shot 55 percent in the first quarter, with Johnson scoring 13 points.<br />“It was very important for us to get off to a good start and sustain it (because of the injuries), especially on the road, ” Johnson said. “I just tried to take what the defense gave me. ”<br /><br />Alonzo Gee matched a career high with 20 points to lead Cleveland, which has lost three straight. Rookie Kyrie Irving scored 19 points and had 10 assists for his first career double-double.<br /><br />Forward Vladimir Radmanovic missed the game with a back injury sustained in Friday’s win over Washington. Forward Marvin Williams (hip flexor), shooting guard Willie Green (hamstring) and point guard Jannero Pargo (stomach virus) were also out for the Hawks.<br /><br />Williams’ injury has forced coach Larry Drew to use a starting lineup that features Johnson, a six-time All-Star at shooting guard, playing small forward. Jeff Teague and Kirk Hinrich started in the backcourt to go with power forward Josh Smith, and center Zaza Pachulia.<br /><br />“Everything kind of happened for a reason, ” Johnson said. “You now have three guys that are playmakers, can handle the ball, and make things happen. ”<br /><br />At least for the short term, Atlanta’s new look is working. Teague added 18 points and Hinrich scored 14.<br /><br />“I’m glad we played as well as we played because, through the course of the game, I kept checking with the coaches to make sure we weren’t exposing ourselves with bad matchups, ” Drew said.<br /><br />Cleveland, playing its first game since trading guard Ramon Sessions to the Los angeles Lakers on Thursday, struggled on both ends of the floor. Atlanta shot 50. 6 percent from the field while Cleveland hit 39. 3 of its shots.<br /><br />“They came out and punched us in the mouth and I don’t think we ever really responded after that, ” Cavaliers coach Byron Scott said.<br /><br />Atlanta’s biggest lead came at 69-50 before the Cavaliers got back in the game with an 18-5 run that cut the lead to 74-68. Johnson scored at the end of the third quarter and started the fourth with another basket to begin an 8-0 run as the Hawks regained control.<br /><br />The fourth quarter began with Irving on the bench for some rest, a decision Scott didn’t regret. Sessions’ departure means Daniel Gibson will be the backup point guard.<br /><br />“He was pretty tired, playing that whole third quarter, ” Scott said of Irving, who played 37 minutes. “We still have to find a way when he comes out of the game to run our offense a little bit smoother. ”<br /><br />Johnson, who has battled a sore left knee most of the season, was 11 of 16 from the field, had five assists and four rebounds.<br /><br />Atlanta extended its winning streak over Cleveland to six games. Smith scored seven points, hitting 3 of 15 from the field, but had eight rebounds and a season-high nine assists.<br /><br />“It came down to how we started the game, ” Irving said. “At times we didn’t play with the sense of urgency we needed. To beat a good team, you have to be that much better on that day. ”<br /><br />Rookie Tristan Thompson, the No. 4 pick in the draft, made his first NBA start at center. Thompson is a natural power forward, but Scott hasn’t been pleased with the play of Ryan Hollins and Semih Erden at center. Thompson scored seven points and had six rebounds in 35 minutes.<br /><br />Antawn Jamison scored 17 points for the Cavaliers, but was 6 for 22 from the field.<br /><br />It’s unclear how many players will be available for the Hawks when they host Boston on Monday. Pargo was admitted to the Cleveland Clinic on Sunday because of his stomach virus and didn’t travel with the team to Atlanta.<br /><br />NOTES: Pachuila had a game-high 12 rebounds. … Jason Collins, who missed the previous 21 games with a sprained left elbow, played the final three minutes. … The Hawks play their next three games at home, including a rematch with the Cavaliers on Wednesday. Cleveland plays at New jersey on Monday. … Irving didn’t have much to say when asked about Duke’s loss to Lehigh in the NCAA Tournament. “Duke lost? ” he said. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. We were on vacation. ” … Scott said C Anderson Varejao (right wrist fracture) will be evaluated by the team’s medical staff this week. Varejao has been sidelined since Feb. 11. … F Luke Walton, acquired in the trade with the Lakers, dressed but didn’t play. He appeared in only nine games with Los angeles. Walton has been bothered by a back injury most of the season and has recently had gastroenteritis.

I can tell you that, ” Halladay said.<br /><br />“There’s a fine line between knowing what you need to accomplish and trying to prove a point or be too competitive or be caught up in it. That’s something you try and learn to be aware of. It bothers you, but ultimately, you’ve got to keep in mind what’s going on and ultimately what you’re trying to accomplish. ”<br /><br />Without star infielders Ryan Howard and Chase Utley, who are injured, the Phillies will have to become more dependent on their pitching.<br /><br />“We have enough good players.
