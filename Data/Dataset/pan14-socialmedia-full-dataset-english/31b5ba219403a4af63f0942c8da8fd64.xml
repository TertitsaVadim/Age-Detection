The demand for sheet prints for outdoor signage and banner advertisements, to say the least, is growing as a result of many advantages consumers perceive that polyester, cotton and more natural fabrics have over paper and vinyl since printing mediums. <br /><br />But when we speak of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXh0aWwtb25lLmRl" target="_blank">textildruck</a>, we do not just mean a single process by which printouts are made on fabrics. There are in least three techniques applied to creating printouts on materials, and each technique has advantages and drawbacks over the others. The three major techniques applied to textile printing using wide-format machines are discussed below. <br /><br />Dye Sublimation Send Printing <br /><br />Dye sublimation operates by transforming solid dye directly into gas, completely bypassing that liquid state. Heat is an essential factor in this process because it is the one that &quot;melts&quot; the solid ink and moves it into gas. <br /><br />In dye sublimation transfer stamping, the image is first printed out in reverse on a sheet involving transfer or carrier cardstock. Whatever is printed over the carrier paper is then used in the fabric with the use of roll-to-roll heat press.

The ink gas created in the sublimation process is forced directly onto the fabric so that it binds and solidifies with individual fibers to create the printout. <br /><br />The main advantage of direct dye sublimation printing is which it reduces the time needed to produce the printouts, simply because the step involving send paper is eliminated. Nonetheless, the process is still limited to polyester fabrics and the fabric itself needs to be coated so the ink would bind while using the fibers. Also, the resulting image is not as crisp as using dye sublimation transfer printing since ink tends to spread and blot in the fabric. <br /><br />Direct Digital Textile Printing <br /><br />Immediate digital  is popular the type of who do not prefer to be limited to polyester as soon as printing on fabric. This textile printing technique works together with the wide-format printer placing ink directly on the fabric and not having to transform it first from solid to gas. <br /><br />With this technique, however, the ink to use should be appropriate on the fabric to be printed upon in order to attain the best producing results. For example, reactive inks must be used for cotton while acid inks are utilized for wools and silks. This nonetheless results in brilliantly colored textile printouts. However, the process of finishing the printout may be tedious because after this printing, the fabric would need to be steamed, washed and then dried. <br /><br />There are three major ways to textile printing with a wide-format printer. Each technique has its best uses, its advantages and it is disadvantages.
