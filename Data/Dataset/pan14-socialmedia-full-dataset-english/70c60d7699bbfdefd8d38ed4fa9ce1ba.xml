However, is your pool extremely safe for swimming?<br /><br />Your swimming pool really needs to be the clean and the safe place because germs &amp; infections are lousy offsprings of dirty waters. Your pool water often get contaminated by a number of pollutants, such as dust, leaves, chemical wastes, pollen, spores, bacteria, etc. If not checked, these pollutants change your pool to a breeding place for germs and diseases.<br /><br />Your contaminated swimming pool can cause several illnesses such as skin, ear, upper respiratory infections, diarrhea etc. Often flus, grippers, or influenzas spread thru contaminated pool water.<br /><br />However, proper swimming pool maintenance and sanitation can help prevent most of your infections &amp; diseases. Your swimming pool pump &amp; filter plays vital role in cleaning pool water. The pump circulates water thru the filter to take out mud and other pollutants. Your pump should run at least 10 hrs a day. Your pool filter keeps the pool water clear.<br /><br />Your plumbing circuit may also contain an electric heater, solar panels, and chemical injector. You should keep checking this pool paraphernalia regularly.<br /><br />Your swimming pool chemistry is rather-rather important in pool sanitization. Sanitizers are the chemicals that you use to kill bacteria and control algae growth in your swimming pool. Some common sanitizers are chlorine and bromine compounds that must be added to the pool on a regular basis to avert bacterial growth.<br /><br />You can also make use of an algae inhibitor. You should do it before you have an algae problem. These are commonly available in a liquid form. You can pour it in near the skimmer and distributed to all the areas of the pool.<br /><br />You should regularly check the chemistry of your pool i.e. the pH level, which is the relative acidity or baseness of your pool water. The standard pH levels should be between 7.2 and 7.6. The water turns acidic, if the pH level is too low. If the pH level is too high, you will notice scale buildup on your tiles. You should use a good swimming pool calculator to check and adjust the quantity of chemicals in your swimming pool.<br /><br />You require several cleaning and servicing tools for cleaning and sanitizing your swimming pool. Your cleaning tools include telepoles, skimmer, wall and floor brush, vacuum head and hose, leaf vacuum and garden hose, tile brush and soap, acid spotter, and water testing kits. You can clean and sanitize your swimming pool bottom and walls, emptying your swimming pool.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaWlnby5jb20vdXNlci90b2RkbWF0dGhld3M1MTI/ZG9tYWluPXN3eWhhbHB5b25kYWdhcmxvaXNjay5qYW1lbmRvLm5ldA__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaWlnby5jb20vdXNlci90b2RkbWF0dGhld3M1MTI_" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3llbWxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC93aW5kZXJtZXJlLXBvb2wtc2VydmljZXMtMjgv" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>

A pool pump running 8 hours a day consumes, on average, around $1000 in electricity a year. The reason it is so expensive to run is that it runs at full speed from the minute it turns on until the minute it turns off (imagine getting in your car, flooring the accelerator for 8 hours straight and doing that every single day). Pool pump motors run hot and noisy and, as a result of their tough life, they typically do not last long.<br /><br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8px9MIXeMPI%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/embed/8px9MIXeMPI&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br /><br />Not any more………..<br /><br />As of March 15th 2012 the law in Florida changes. From that date replacement pool motors must be either 2 speed or multi-speed. California has already adopted this same law change and, as a result, the products to meet the changes are already available. 2 speed pumps cost, on average, $600 a year to run (a saving of $400), while variable speed pumps cost just $200 (saving $800). <br /><br />A variable speed pump running at its lowest speed 24 hours a day consumes around as much electricity as a one speed pump running just one hour a day!<br /><br />The law change is good for the environment but, just as important, this change benefits consumers as significant energy savings will be achieved.<br /><br />Your options can be summarized as follows;-<br /><br />Replace motor with same style<br /><br />·	Pool motor technology not changed for years<br />·	One speed pool motors run at 100% capacity all the time<br />·	Running at 100% capacity shortens motor life<br />·	Only has one seal between wet end and electronics<br />·	Motor runs hot and noisy<br />·	Failure to prime often results in premature motor failure<br />·	Law changes 3/15/2012 - warranty motors may be harder to find<br />·	Costs around $350 - $550 depending on horsepower<br /><br />Install energy efficient pump<br /><br />·	Latest technology<br />·	Programmable to run when you want<br />·	No separate timer<br />·	Two seals between wet end and electronics<br />·	Priming protection system shuts off pump if no water flow at start up<br />·	Energy savings of 60% - 80%<br />·	Motor runs much cooler and quieter<br />·	Compliance with new pool motor code effective 3/15/2012<br />·	Costs around $1500<br /><br />Pays for itself within 1 - 2 years due to significant energy saving!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi5zb3VwLmlvL3Bvc3QvMjMzOTQ0MDQzL1dpbmRlcm1lcmUtUG9vbC1NYWludGVuYW5jZQ__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTYyNzA5" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi53ZWJzaXRld2l6YXJkLmNvbS93aW5kZXJtZXJlLXBvb2wtc2VydmljZTk3Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Service</a>

Yet, while the sun and water is delightful, maintaining a pool can be less than enjoyable - and mighty expensive. In addition to chemicals and cleaning supplies, there is the expense of heating the pool in the cooler months and the hassle of dealing with debris falling into the pool. After all, who doesn't dread the prospect of fishing leaves out of the pool in the fall and the murkiness of muddy waters after a hard rain?<br /><br />Thankfully, there have been great advances in pool maintenance, most notably in low profile swimming pool enclosures. Instead of the labor-intensive and messy process of covering and uncovering the pool with a traditional pool cover, an increasing number of pool owners are turning to swimming pool enclosures that are easy to install and maintain. A telescopic pool enclosure, for example, encloses the pool like a dome but is easily pushed back for full accessibility.<br /><br />When it comes to a telescopic pool enclosure, there are two basic types: one is installed on tracks laid on either side of the pool, and the other is trackless. In either case, the dome is tall enough (ranging from about 105cm to 185cm) so that you can open the hinged door and enjoy swimming even in inclement weather. Because it is built like a telescope, it's a breeze to push back the enclosure on sunny days.<br /><br />These kinds of swimming pool enclosures offer more than aesthetic value, however. Your heating bill will be reduced, since the enclosures absorb and retain the sun's heat. You'll also spend less for chemicals, since there will be less water evaporation. One of the most significant benefits is that a telescopic pool enclosure has a child safety lock, which ensures that your pool is safe even when you're not using it. Chances are, though, that you'll be using your pool much more frequently, since the covering and warmth retention make the water inviting even when the weather's bad.<br /><br />Depending upon the size and type of the enclosure you choose, it takes two people anywhere from about five hours to about fourteen hours to install. When selecting a company that meets the needs for your swimming pool enclosures, choose one that will give you a head start in the installation process. The price of the enclosure should include all of the tools you'll need, perhaps with the exception of an electric drill. You should also receive a complete parts list and comprehensive, step-by-step illustrations of the installation process. The best companies will also provide you with a DVD that demonstrates the key stages of assembly.<br /><br />There's little doubt that swimming pool enclosures pay for themselves many times over, in terms of actual money saved and in terms of the increased opportunities you'll have to enjoy your pool. So dive right in and explore enclosure solutions that are right for you!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mb2xrZC5jb20vZGV0YWlsL3d3dy5mb2xrZC5jb20lMkZkZXRhaWwlMkZ3d3cudGhpc25leHQuY29tJTI1MkZwaWNrJTI1MkZuZXclMjUyRnN1Ym1pdCUyNTJGdXJs" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Service</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaWlnby5jb20vdXNlci90b2RkbWF0dGhld3M1MTI/ZG9tYWluPWJnbS5tZQ__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3llbWxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC93aW5kZXJtZXJlLXBvb2wtLW1haW50ZW5hbmNlLTIv" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Service</a>

Your pool water often get contaminated by a number of pollutants, such as dust, leaves, chemical wastes, pollen, spores, bacteria, etc. If not checked, these pollutants change your pool to a breeding place for germs and diseases.<br /><br />Your contaminated swimming pool can cause several illnesses such as skin, ear, upper respiratory infections, diarrhea etc. Often flus, grippers, or influenzas spread thru contaminated pool water.<br /><br />However, proper swimming pool maintenance and sanitation can help prevent most of your infections &amp; diseases. Your swimming pool pump &amp; filter plays vital role in cleaning pool water. The pump circulates water thru the filter to take out mud and other pollutants. Your pump should run at least 10 hrs a day. Your pool filter keeps the pool water clear.<br /><br />Your plumbing circuit may also contain an electric heater, solar panels, and chemical injector. You should keep checking this pool paraphernalia regularly.<br /><br />Your swimming pool chemistry is rather-rather important in pool sanitization. Sanitizers are the chemicals that you use to kill bacteria and control algae growth in your swimming pool. Some common sanitizers are chlorine and bromine compounds that must be added to the pool on a regular basis to avert bacterial growth.<br /><br />You can also make use of an algae inhibitor. You should do it before you have an algae problem. These are commonly available in a liquid form. You can pour it in near the skimmer and distributed to all the areas of the pool.<br /><br />You should regularly check the chemistry of your pool i.e. the pH level, which is the relative acidity or baseness of your pool water. The standard pH levels should be between 7.2 and 7.6. The water turns acidic, if the pH level is too low. If the pH level is too high, you will notice scale buildup on your tiles. You should use a good swimming pool calculator to check and adjust the quantity of chemicals in your swimming pool.<br /><br />You require several cleaning and servicing tools for cleaning and sanitizing your swimming pool. Your cleaning tools include telepoles, skimmer, wall and floor brush, vacuum head and hose, leaf vacuum and garden hose, tile brush and soap, acid spotter, and water testing kits. You can clean and sanitize your swimming pool bottom and walls, emptying your swimming pool.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWViZXJiaWJlci5jb20vcGVvcGxlL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMg__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Service</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGlzbmV4dC5jb20vcGljay9uZXcvc3VibWl0L3VybC8_" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3llbWxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC93aW5kZXJtZXJlLXBvb2wtc2VydmljZXMtMjgv" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>

		<document id="78e8cb85dc4011f15d0d08dd8e753ab5" url=""><![CDATA[Windermere Pool Services<br/><br/>Pool pumps are very inefficient energy consumers and pool pump technology has not changed much over the years. A pool pump running 8 hours a day consumes, on average, around $1000 in electricity a year. The reason it is so expensive to run is that it runs at full speed from the minute it turns on until the minute it turns off (imagine getting in your car, flooring the accelerator for 8 hours straight and doing that every single day). Pool pump motors run hot and noisy and, as a result of their tough life, they typically do not last long.<br /><br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8px9MIXeMPI%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/embed/8px9MIXeMPI&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br /><br />Not any more………..<br /><br />As of March 15th 2012 the law in Florida changes. From that date replacement pool motors must be either 2 speed or multi-speed. California has already adopted this same law change and, as a result, the products to meet the changes are already available. 2 speed pumps cost, on average, $600 a year to run (a saving of $400), while variable speed pumps cost just $200 (saving $800). <br /><br />A variable speed pump running at its lowest speed 24 hours a day consumes around as much electricity as a one speed pump running just one hour a day!<br /><br />The law change is good for the environment but, just as important, this change benefits consumers as significant energy savings will be achieved.<br /><br />Your options can be summarized as follows;-<br /><br />Replace motor with same style<br /><br />·	Pool motor technology not changed for years<br />·	One speed pool motors run at 100% capacity all the time<br />·	Running at 100% capacity shortens motor life<br />·	Only has one seal between wet end and electronics<br />·	Motor runs hot and noisy<br />·	Failure to prime often results in premature motor failure<br />·	Law changes 3/15/2012 - warranty motors may be harder to find<br />·	Costs around $350 - $550 depending on horsepower<br /><br />Install energy efficient pump<br /><br />·	Latest technology<br />·	Programmable to run when you want<br />·	No separate timer<br />·	Two seals between wet end and electronics<br />·	Priming protection system shuts off pump if no water flow at start up<br />·	Energy savings of 60% - 80%<br />·	Motor runs much cooler and quieter<br />·	Compliance with new pool motor code effective 3/15/2012<br />·	Costs around $1500<br /><br />Pays for itself within 1 - 2 years due to significant energy saving!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi5vYm9sb2cuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi5zaXRlcnVuLmV1L2h0dHA6Ly95ZW1sZS5jb20vc3BvcnQvd2luZGVybWVyZS1wb29sLS1tYWludGVuYW5jZS00Lw__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool  Maintenance</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMi5zaXRlcnVuLmV1L2luZGV4LnBocD9wZz0xMzUwNjQ_" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Service</a>

Yet, while the sun and water is delightful, maintaining a pool can be less than enjoyable - and mighty expensive. In addition to chemicals and cleaning supplies, there is the expense of heating the pool in the cooler months and the hassle of dealing with debris falling into the pool. After all, who doesn't dread the prospect of fishing leaves out of the pool in the fall and the murkiness of muddy waters after a hard rain?<br /><br />Thankfully, there have been great advances in pool maintenance, most notably in low profile swimming pool enclosures. Instead of the labor-intensive and messy process of covering and uncovering the pool with a traditional pool cover, an increasing number of pool owners are turning to swimming pool enclosures that are easy to install and maintain. A telescopic pool enclosure, for example, encloses the pool like a dome but is easily pushed back for full accessibility.<br /><br />When it comes to a telescopic pool enclosure, there are two basic types: one is installed on tracks laid on either side of the pool, and the other is trackless. In either case, the dome is tall enough (ranging from about 105cm to 185cm) so that you can open the hinged door and enjoy swimming even in inclement weather. Because it is built like a telescope, it's a breeze to push back the enclosure on sunny days.<br /><br />These kinds of swimming pool enclosures offer more than aesthetic value, however. Your heating bill will be reduced, since the enclosures absorb and retain the sun's heat. You'll also spend less for chemicals, since there will be less water evaporation. One of the most significant benefits is that a telescopic pool enclosure has a child safety lock, which ensures that your pool is safe even when you're not using it. Chances are, though, that you'll be using your pool much more frequently, since the covering and warmth retention make the water inviting even when the weather's bad.<br /><br />Depending upon the size and type of the enclosure you choose, it takes two people anywhere from about five hours to about fourteen hours to install. When selecting a company that meets the needs for your swimming pool enclosures, choose one that will give you a head start in the installation process. The price of the enclosure should include all of the tools you'll need, perhaps with the exception of an electric drill. You should also receive a complete parts list and comprehensive, step-by-step illustrations of the installation process. The best companies will also provide you with a DVD that demonstrates the key stages of assembly.<br /><br />There's little doubt that swimming pool enclosures pay for themselves many times over, in terms of actual money saved and in terms of the increased opportunities you'll have to enjoy your pool. So dive right in and explore enclosure solutions that are right for you!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGlzbmV4dC5jb20vcGljay9uZXcvc3VibWl0L3VybC8_" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saWViZXJiaWJlci5jb20vcGVvcGxlL3RvZGRtYXR0aGV3czUxMg__" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3llbWxlLmNvbS9zcG9ydC93aW5kZXJtZXJlLXBvb2wtc2VydmljZXMtMTkv" target="_blank">Windermere Pool Services</a>

It was designed with children in mind; thus the title of kiddie pool. These popular pools come in a wide variety of different shapes, sizes, and styles. Despite the different designs, most kiddie pools do not average more than two feet of water. In fact, many are designed to hold less than that amount. As previously mentioned, kiddie pools are designed for families with small children; however, anyone can own them. They are also popular among teens and adults, especially those that live in a home or an apartment with a small backyard.<br /><br />Since most kiddie pools are small in size, many believe that they do not need pool accessories. While your kiddie pool may not need pool accessories for you to enjoy it, you may want to consider purchasing some. The size of a kiddie pool may limit the number of pool toys or pool accessories that you can have, but there are still many products that you may find available for purchase. These products may include kiddie pool cleaning supplies, lifesaving devices, and pool toys<br /><br />Although the depth of most kiddie pools is only around two feet, you may still want to protect your child. The best available lifesaving device is a lifejacket; however, many are difficult or impossible to use in a kiddie pool. If you want to equip your child with something that may help them stay afloat, you may want to examine arm floaties. Once inflated, arm floaties will slip on to a child’s arm. What is nice about most arm floaties is that they can be purchased for a low price. Many discount stores, department stores, and even dollar stores carry arm floaties.<br /><br />While it is nice to protect your child while they are swimming, you will also want them to have fun. This can be done with the purchase of pool toys. As with most aboveground and in-ground pool toys, you will find that there are a wide variety of different pool toys that are safe to use in a kiddie pool. These items may include, but should not be limited to, beach balls, swim rings, and small floating toys. Similar to, the above mentioned arm floaties, many of these pool toys can be purchased for a low price.<br /><br />In addition to pool toys and lifesaving devices, you may also want to examine other pool accessories. These other accessories may include pool cleaning supplies or maintenance supplies. Despite the fact that many kiddie pools are easy to drain and refill, not everyone may be able do this. If you are unable to regularly change the water in your kiddie pool, you may be able to benefit from purchasing a few pool cleaning supplies. A pool skimmer makes it easy to remove debris from all pools, including kiddie pools.<br /><br />Since most kiddie pools are inflatable, you may want to have repair kits on hands.
