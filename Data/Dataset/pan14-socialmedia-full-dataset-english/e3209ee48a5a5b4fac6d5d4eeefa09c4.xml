None of them had graduated high school. I really noticed how my father hated his job and my mother never worked. We lived pay check to pay check. It was hard for them just to pay the bills, let alone buy what we needed. They never really did make us, or tell us we had to go to school. My sister missed a lot of days and so didn't my bother. I was the only one that was into my school and my education. I remember thinking to my self that it wasn't right. I needed and wanted them to tell us what we had to do and make sure we did it. I wanted them to be our parents like they where suppose to be. But that never happen. I was so good at school, I got all kinds of rewards from, student of the month and year, to awards for having the highesr grades out of the entire grade I was in. All I wanted was for them to be proud of all my accomplishments, but they never was. I was all a lone and had only myself to be there for me.
<br /><br />I graduated high school, it was so bitter sweet though cause there was no one there to see me graduate.
<br /><br />I remember everyone asking me where my family was. I tried to lie about them at first, but then the pain from it all got to me and I lost it. ?My friends and teachers all cried to, then everyone that was there for their children all started cring . I felt so bad, like I made a what was suppose to be a happy moment turn sad. But everyone was cring because they never knew what I was going though and that I was all alone. They were so upset and mad at theirselves for never noing or paying attention to what was going on. Some of them were even upset, but more hurt that I never did tell any of then or my friends. I never let it show, not even my pain. It was hard not to, but I didn't want people to feel sorry for me, I just wanted them to like me for who I was and since they didn't know they did. One thing great came out of that bitter sweet day though, from that day on I have never been alone since then.

<br /><br />I love to write specially when it comes from my heart, and everything that I do write does. I just want to find someone that will be here with me, not just for me. I am trying to do all I can to find that special someone, but I don't want to come off as I can not find anyone, I can just not the right one yet.
<br /><br />I just wonder sometimes if I should just give up and let it happen if it's going to. Not !!! I have to much love to give to someone.All I want to do is to make someone laugh or just smile, to make someone happy, that's what truely makes me happy. So my question is, Why is it so hard to find that someone?
<br /><br />I guess he is out there somewhere, just have not found him yet, but I not giving up, I've been through to much too.

<br /><br />I was the only one in his life, or so I thought. He was my frist love and it felt so great. I remember when we would go out he was so proud to be with me, and he told his friends about me all the time. I never once ever thought it would end, specially the way it did. I was at my father's house one day, like always, I thought he was at work. He was always there before, but not this time.
<br /><br />I finally decided it was time for me to go home, leave my dads. I went to the store on my way home and did what you would normally do on any given day. I was driving down our road whem I noticed his truck was in the drive way and so wasn't my sister's car. I wasn't suppose to go home that day, I was going to stay at my dads, but decided to go home for odd reason. I had always stayed at my dads cause he worked nights, but there was something telling to go home, actually I was feeling like something bad had hapen and didn't know why.
<br /><br />I pulled into the drive way really slow, I wanted to surprise him by me coming home that early and I never for once ever thought there was something going on between him and my sister. Anyway, I got out of the car went up to the front door and open it up just like any other time before.
<br /><br />When the door opened i allmost couldn't breath and I passed out from the shock of what I seen. There was my sister and our friend with my old man, in my livingroom, having a threesome. I have never felt that much before in my life. It was so bad, I thought I had a heart atack or stroke. 
<br /><br />All I could do was stand there, I couldn't move, It was like I was dead, I was in shock so bad that I had to go to the hospital. On the way there I couldn't move, talk, or even feel anything, nothing, it was like I was dead. For the next year after that I was allways walking around like I was lost, and I was. I didn't know anything, didn't feel anything, I was dead.
<br /><br />It's been a few years since then and I still sometimes go into a sate of mind where I really not here or any where at that matter. I am stil going in out out of shock for all the pain. I seen him the other day and all he could is look at me and not even say a word, He had hurt himsele just as bad as they did me.
<br /><br />I left him that day I caught them, I could never be with him again, cause every time I seen either one of them, all my mind would do is start playing it over and over in my head. 
<br /><br />I am doing so much better now. I just can't trust anyone. But i know someday I will again, I just can't give up on that wish.

<br />twisting metal, fiberglass. 
<br />The scene is set it all goes black, 
<br />The curtain raised the final act. 
<br />Sirens raging in the night, 
<br />sounds of horror, gasps of fright. 
<br />Intense pain, the smell of blood 
<br />tearing eyes begin to flood. 
<br />They pull out our bodies one by one, 
<br />What is going on, we were only having fun! 
<br />One of my friends is missing, what did I do? 
<br />Her scattered belongings everywhere, 
<br />in the road there lies her shoe. 
<br />A man is leaning over me and looking in my eyes, 
<br />&amp;quot;What were you thinking, son&amp;quot;? 
<br />&amp;quot;Did you really think that you could drive?&amp;quot; 
<br />He pulled up the sheet still looking in my eyes, 
<br />&amp;quot;If you'd only called your Mom or Dad, you'd still be alive!&amp;quot; 
<br />I started to scream, I started to yell; 
<br />But no one could hear me, no one could tell. 
<br />They put me in an ambulance; they took me away. 
<br />The doctor at the hospital exclaimed, &amp;quot;DOA!&amp;quot; 
<br />My father's in shock, my mother in tears, 
<br />she collapses in grief, overcome by the fear. 
<br />They take me to this house and place me in this box. 
<br />I keep asking what is happening, 
<br />But I cant make it stop. 
<br />Everyone is crying, my family is so sad. 
<br />I wish someone would answer me, 
<br />I'm starting to get mad. 
<br />My mother leans over me and kisses me good-bye, 
<br />My father pulling her away, she is screaming, &amp;quot;WHY&amp;quot;? 
<br />They lower my body into a dirt grave, 
<br />It feels so very cold, I yell to be saved. 
<br />Then I see an angel; I begin to cry. 
<br />Can you tell me what is happening? 
<br />she replies &amp;quot;YOU DIED.&amp;quot; 
<br />I can't be dead; I'm still so young! 
<br />I want to do so many things - like sing, and dance, and run. 
<br />What about college or graduation day? 
<br />what about a wedding? Please - I want to stay. 
<br />The angel looked upon me, and with a saddened voice, 
<br />&amp;quot;It didn't have to end like this; you knew you had a choice.&amp;quot; 
<br />&amp;quot;I'm sorry it's too late now; time I can't turn back.&amp;quot; 
<br />&amp;quot;Your life is finished; that, my son, is a fact!&amp;quot; 
<br />Why did this happen? I didn't want to die! 
<br />The angel, she embraced me and with her words she sighed, 
<br />&amp;quot;Son, this is the consequence you paid to drink and drive. 
<br />I wish you made a better choice, If you did you would be alive. 
<br />It doesn't matter if you beg me, or plead on bended knee, There is 
<br />nothing I can do, you have to come with me.&amp;quot; 
<br />Looking down at my family, I said my last good-bye. 
<br />&amp;quot;I'm sorry I disappointed you, Dad. 
<br />Mommy, please don't cry, 
<br />I didn't mean to hurt you, or cause you any pain. 
<br />I'm sorry all you're left with is a grave that bears my name. 
<br />I'm sorry all your dreams for me have all been ripped away; 
<br />the plans for my future all gathered in a grave. 
<br />It was such a stupid thing I did, I wish I could take it back; 
<br />But the curtain is being lowered. 
<br />SO ENDS THE FINAL ACT...
<br /><br />PLEASE DON&amp;quot;T DRINK AND DRIVE...

<br />With your bitter, twisted lies, 
<br />You may trod me in the very dirt 
<br />But still, like dust, I'll rise. 
<br /><br />Does my sassiness upset you? 
<br />Why are you beset with gloom? 
<br />'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells 
<br />Pumping in my living room. 
<br /><br />Just like moons and like suns, 
<br />With the certainty of tides, 
<br />Just like hopes springing high, 
<br />Still I'll rise. 
<br /><br />Did you want to see me broken? 
<br />Bowed head and lowered eyes? 
<br />Shoulders falling down like teardrops. 
<br />Weakened by my soulful cries. 
<br /><br />Does my haughtiness offend you? 
<br />Don't you take it awful hard 
<br />'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines 
<br />Diggin' in my own back yard. 
<br /><br />You may shoot me with your words, 
<br />You may cut me with your eyes, 
<br />You may kill me with your hatefulness, 
<br />But still, like air, I'll rise. 
<br /><br />Does my sexiness upset you? 
<br />Does it come as a surprise 
<br />That I dance like I've got diamonds 
<br />At the meeting of my thighs? 
<br /><br />Out of the huts of history's shame 
<br />I rise 
<br />Up from a past that's rooted in pain 
<br />I rise 
<br />I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, 
<br />Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. 
<br />Leaving behind nights of terror and fear 
<br />I rise 
<br />Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear 
<br />I rise 
<br />Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, 
<br />I am the dream and the hope of the slave. 
<br />I rise 
<br />I rise 
<br />I rise...

<br />Then the puddles in the streets are but reflections of our pain; 
<br />Yet rain is the cleansing, that falls from the sky, 
<br />So much like a tear, which comes from a persons eye; 
<br />Such as love is to hate, and the feelings of joy and rage, 
<br />Each an emotional pull, in life's book, written on a different page; 
<br />They are things that we must feel, as we live out each day, 
<br />Like the winds of change, we also feel the influence and sway; 
<br />Then there is the mortar, holding our emotions together, a thing called fear, 
<br />But when we weigh this feeling, to our eye, our fears aren¡¦t all that clear; 
<br />We fear all things in life, such as our success or even to lose, 
<br />However, our life is filled with this, and we the players must chose; 
<br />We are drawn into relationships, one after another, times untold, 
<br />And we enter into these, sometimes timidly, while other so bold; 
<br />For it is our position in life, to experience, all that life can give, 
<br />Feeling joy and pain, otherwise, how would we know that we live; 
<br />So the puddles we see are not reflecting pain, a thing of shame, 
<br />But only puddles of rainwater, which has fallen in life's game; 
<br />So we must wipe the tear from our eye, and face each tomorrow, 
<br />Looking for the sunshine after the rain, not held back by personal sorrow...

<br /><br />A special world for you and me
<br />A special bond one cannot see
<br />It wraps us up in its cocoon
<br />And holds us fiercely in its womb.
<br /><br />Its fingers spread like fine spun gold
<br />Gently nestling us to the fold
<br />Like silken thread it holds us fast
<br />Bonds like this are meant to last.
<br /><br />And though at times a thread may break
<br />A new one forms in its wake
<br />To bind us closer and keep us strong
<br />In a special world, where we belong.

<br />I love the way you kiss me,
<br />Your lips so soft and smooth.

<br />I'd like you to think back to the very first time we met,
<br />How you felt around me? The memories we shared,
<br />And just remember that once upon a time, you really cared.
<br /><br />Now think about how we parted, and how much I cried,
<br />But please don't speak, remember that I never ever lied,
<br />That I told you the honest truth about why we were to split,
<br />But now I'd like you to know that my heart broke bit by bit.
<br /><br />The pain was deep, unbearable and painful, for so many years,
<br />I'll never forget all the sadness, all the uncontrollable tears,
<br />Slowly I am rebuilding my life, I am content with what I've got,
<br />And although it is hard I am beginning to forget what I have not.
<br /><br />You were a special part of my life that I will never forget, 
<br />A part of my life that broke my heart, but that I don't regret,
<br />You gave me some happy memories that I'll keep in my heart,
<br />Although sometimes I wish that you and I didn't have to part.
<br /><br />You were my first love and my true love, that will always be so,
<br />After all of the heartache, sadness and never ending pain, I know,
<br />You and I had something special and that will never change,
<br />Because I love you and loving someone else will always seem strange.
<br /><br />Would you just listen and please don't say a word, not ever,
<br />I'd like you to remember that once upon a time, we said forever,
<br />That I had hopes and dreams, that I was the one who threw them away,
<br />And this is something I will always regret until my dying day.

<br />I got lost in their depth
<br />A glance into the future
<br />Revealing the secrets she kept
<br /><br />For so many years she cared too
<br />Yet we were both afraid to say
<br />We avoided each other completely...
<br />Every time, simply another day
<br /><br />She cried to me one night.
<br />~Please help, I don't know what to do~
<br />I wrapped my arms around her body.
<br />~It is okay now, I'm here with you~
<br /><br />She told me about her boyfriend,
<br />He cheated, and hurt her bad...
<br />I told her not to worry...
<br />But in the inside I was getting mad.
<br /><br />I held back my anger...
<br />And I comforted her instead.
<br />Playing with her hair,
<br />She lay still on my bed.
<br /><br />I leaned over to kiss her cheek,
<br />She smiled and turned to me.
<br />~Thank you for being there...
<br />I Have finally learned to see~
<br /><br />With that she drifted off,
<br />I left her quietly sleeping.
<br />~How could anyone want to hurt her? ~
<br />I ran through thoughts, my heart leaping.
<br /><br />I met up with her boyfriend,
<br />Swung out of pure love and rage.
<br />A knife stabbed through my stomach..
<br />~God where were you today?~
<br /><br />My head smacking onto the pavement,
<br />My breath getting thin...
<br />My vision blurred and fading slowly...
<br />This was a battle I could never win.
<br /><br />As this darkness consumes me...
<br />Light fills my eyes...
<br />I am proud to have lost my life,
<br />If it meant ending her cries...
