<br /><br />I'd like to share it with you all...tnx for Your time <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />_____________________________________
<br /><br />During one of our seminars, a woman asked a common question. She said, &quot;How do I know if I married the right person?&quot; 
<br /><br />I noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so I said, &quot;It depends. Is that your husband?&quot;
<br /><br />In all seriousness, she answered &quot;How do you know?&quot;
<br /><br />Let me answer this question because the chances are good that it's weighing on your mind.
<br /><br />Here's the answer.
<br /><br />EVERY relationship has a cycle. In the beginning, you fell in love with your spouse. You anticipated their call, wanted their touch, and liked their idiosyncrasies. 
<br /><br />Falling in love with your spouse wasn't hard. In fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You didn't have to DO anything. That's why it's called &quot;falling&quot; in love... because it's happening TO YOU. 
<br /><br />People in love sometimes say, &quot;I was swept of my feet.&quot; Think about the imagery of that ___expression. It implies that you were just standing there; doing nothing, and then something came along and happened TO YOU. 
<br /><br />Falling in love is easy. It's a passive and spontaneous experience.
<br /><br />But after a few years of marriage, the euphoria of love fades. It's the natural cycle of EVERY relationship. Slowly but surely, phone calls become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome (when it happens), and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead of being cute, drive you nuts.
<br /><br />The symptoms of this stage vary with every relationship, but if you think about your marriage, you will notice a dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and a much duller or even angry subsequent stage. 
<br /><br />At this point, you and/or your spouse might start asking, &quot;Did I marry the right person?&quot; And as you and your spouse reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had, you may begin to desire that experience with someone else. This is when marriages breakdown. People blame their spouse for their unhappiness and look outside their marriage for fulfillment.
<br /><br />Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes and sizes. Infidelity is the most obvious. But sometimes people turn to work, church, a hobby, a friendship, excessive TV, or abusive substances.
<br /><br />But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your marriage. It lies within it.
<br /><br />I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in love with someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better. But you'd be in the same situation a few years later. Because (listen carefully to this):
<br /><br />THE KEY TO SUCCEEDING IN MARRIAGE IS NOT FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON; IT'S LEARNING TO LOVE THE PERSON YOU FOUND. 
<br /><br />SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience. It'll NEVER just happen to you. You can't &quot;find&quot; LASTING love. You have to &quot;make&quot; it day in and day out. That's why we have the expression &quot;the labor of love.&quot; 
<br />Because it takes time, effort, and energy. And most importantly, it takes WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make your marriage work. 
<br /><br />Make no mistake about it. Love is NOT a mystery. There are specific things you can do (with or without your spouse) to succeed with your marriage.
<br /><br />Just as there are physical laws of the universe (such as gravity), there are also laws for relationships. Just as the right diet and exercise program makes you physically stronger, certain habits in your relationship WILL make your marriage stronger. It's a direct cause and effect. If you know and apply the laws, the results are predictable. .. you can &quot;make&quot; love.
<br /><br />Love in marriage is indeed a &quot;decision&quot;.. . not just a feeling

<br /><br />Human beings crave intimacy, need to love and be loved. Yet people have much trouble doing so. It’s clear from the many letters I get that lots of folks have no idea what a healthy relationship even looks like. Because I care about these things, and care about the environments children grow in, I’m using this space as an attempt to remedy the problem -- again. From many sources and many experts, I have culled some basic rules of relationships. This is by no means an exhaustive list. But it’s a start. Print them out and pin them up on your refrigerator door. I won’t test you on them -- but life will. 
<br />•  Choose a partner wisely and well. We are attracted to people for all kinds of reasons. They remind us of someone from our past. They shower us with gifts and make us feel important. Evaluate a potential partner as you would a friend; look at their character, personality, values, their generosity of spirit, the relationship between their words and actions, their relationships with others.
<br />•  Know your partner’s beliefs about relationships. Different people have different and often conflicting beliefs about relationships. You don’t want to fall in love with someone who expects lots of dishonesty in relationships; they’ll create it where it doesn’t exist. 
<br />•  Don’t confuse sex with love. Especially in the beginning of a relationship, attraction and pleasure in sex are often mistaken for love. 
<br />•  Know your needs and speak up for them clearly. A relationship is not a guessing game. Many people, men as well as women, fear stating their needs and, as a result, camouflage them. The result is disappointment at not getting what they want and anger at a partner for not having met their (unstated) needs. Closeness cannot occur without honesty. Your partner is not a mind reader. 
<br />•  Respect, respect, respect. Inside and outside the relationship, act in ways so that your partner always maintains respect for you. Mutual respect is essential to a good relationship. 
<br />•  View yourselves as a team, which means you are two unique individuals bringing different perspectives and strengths. That is the value of a team -- your differences. 
<br />•  Know how to manage differences; it’s the key to success in a relationship. Disagreements don’t sink relationships. Name-calling does. Learn how to handle the negative feelings that are the unavoidable byproduct of the differences between two people. Stonewalling or avoiding conflicts is NOT managing them.
<br />•  If you don’t understand or like something your partner is doing, ask about it and why he or she is doing it. Talk and explore, don’t assume. 
<br />•  Solve problems as they arise. Don’t let resentments simmer. Most of what goes wrong in relationships can be traced to hurt feelings, leading partners to erect defenses against one another and to become strangers. Or enemies. 
<br />•  Learn to negotiate. Modern relationships no longer rely on roles cast by the culture. Couples create their own roles, so that virtually every act requires negotiation. It works best when good will prevails. Because people’s needs are fluid and change over time, and life’s demands change, too, good relationships are negotiated and renegotiated all the time. 
<br />•  Listen, truly listen, to your partner’s concerns and complaints without judgment. Much of the time, just having someone listen is all we need for solving problems. Plus it opens the door to confiding. And empathy is crucial. Look at things from your partner’s perspective as well as your own.
<br />•  Work hard at maintaining closeness. Closeness doesn’t happen by itself. In its absence, people drift apart and are susceptible to affairs. A good relationship isn’t an end goal; it’s a lifelong process maintained through regular attention. 
<br />•  Take a long-range view. A marriage is an agreement to spend a future together. Check out your dreams with each other regularly to make sure you’re both on the same path. Update your dreams regularly. 
<br />•  Never underestimate the power of good grooming. 
<br />•  Sex is good. Pillow talk is better. Sex is easy, intimacy is difficult. It requires honesty, openness, self-disclosure, confiding concerns, fears, sadnesses as well as hopes and dreams. 
<br />•  Never go to sleep angry. Try a little tenderness. 
<br />•  Apologize, apologize, apologize. Anyone can make a mistake. Repair attempts are crucial -- highly predictive of marital happiness. They can be clumsy or funny, even sarcastic -- but willingness to make up after an argument is central to every happy marriage. 
<br />•  Some dependency is good, but complete dependency on a partner for all one’s needs is an invitation to unhappiness for both partners. We’re all dependent to a degree -- on friends, mentors, spouses. This is true of men as well as women. 
<br />•  Maintain self-respect and self-esteem. It’s easier for someone to like you and to be around you when you like yourself. Research has shown that the more roles people fill, the more sources of self-esteem they have. Meaningful work -- paid or volunteer -- has long been one of the most important ways to exercise and fortify a sense of self.
<br />•  Enrich your relationship by bringing into it new interests from outside the relationship. The more passions in life that you have and share, the richer your relationship will be. It is unrealistic to expect one person to meet all of your needs in life. 
<br />•  Cooperate, cooperate, cooperate. Share responsibilities. Relationships work ONLY when they are two-way streets, with much give and take. 
<br />•  Stay open to spontaneity. 
<br />•  Maintain your energy. Stay healthy. 
<br />•  Recognize that all relationships have their ups and downs and do not ride at a continuous high all the time. Working together through the hard times will make the relationship stronger. 
<br />•  Make good sense of a bad relationship by examining it as a reflection of your beliefs about yourself. Don’t just run away from a bad relationship; you’ll only repeat it with the next partner. Use it as a mirror to look at yourself, to understand what in you is creating this relationship. Change yourself before you change your relationship.
<br />Understand that love is not an absolute, not a limited commodity that you’re in of or out of. It’s a feeling that ebbs and flows depending on how you treat each other. If you learn new ways to interact, the feelings can come flowing back, often stronger than before.

<br /><br />1. Whatever  you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do. 
<br /><br />2. Don't cheat on them. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they will find out and you will be mud. 
<br /><br />3. Beware of every single male relatives and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your ass at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat. 
<br /><br />4. Never miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful. 
<br /><br />5. Don't refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous. 
<br /><br />6. If they slap you hard, you deserved it. 
<br /><br />7. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms. 
<br /><br />8. If you don't sleep with them, do not tell your friends that you did. 
<br /><br />9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it... 
<br /><br />10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales. 
<br /><br />11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your
<br />girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy. 
<br /><br />12. Every girl should eventually get two things from her boyfriend- one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring (Even if it's not a serious relationship). 
<br /><br />13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely. 
<br /><br />14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to kick the crap out of him. 
<br /><br />15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer. 
<br /><br />16. Never, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, &quot;Oh, you're so dumb&quot; or something, never make any gestures back. 
<br /><br />17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went. 
<br /><br />18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals. 
<br /><br />19. Don't flirt with their moms or friends...that's just freaky. 
<br /><br />20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like crap, so be understanding. 
<br /><br />21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it. 
<br /><br />22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend. 
<br /><br />23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you. 
<br /><br />24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked. 
<br /><br />25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle. 
<br /><br />26. Memorize their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life. 
<br /><br />27. Don't marinade the cologne. 
<br /><br />28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice. 
<br /><br />29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out. 
<br /><br />30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond. 
<br /><br />31.Don't ever do anything wrong (well not anything). girls remember things for life and anything you did wrong will be brought back in every argument that you will have in the future

<br />would have wished. It is the content of 
<br />the encounter that is more important than
<br />its form. May you not become too
<br />concerned with material matters, but
<br />instead place immeasurable value on the 
<br />goodness in your heart. Find time in 
<br />each day to see beauty and love in the 
<br />world around you. Realize that each
<br />person has limitless abilities, but each
<br />of us is different in our own way. What
<br />you may feel you lavk in one regard may
<br />be more than compensated for in another.
<br />What you feel you lack in the present may
<br />become one of your strengths in the 
<br />future. May you see your future as one
<br />filled with promise and possibility. 
<br />Learn to view everything as a worthwhile
<br />experience. May you find enough inner
<br />strength to determine your own worth by
<br />yourself, and not be dependent on
<br />another's judgment of your accomplishments.
<br />May you always feel loved. -Sandra Sturtz

<br />Updated: March 21, 2007
<br /><br />For decades, statistics have contended that up to 80 percent of American men will cheat at some point during their marriage. 
<br />But lately I've noticed an emerging trend, one that I recently discussed on the Today Show, that will shock many women: Sure guys still cheat for the sex, but for many men the sex is no longer an end unto itself, but a means to an end: genuine communication and intimacy. 
<br />More and more of those men who cheat say that they do it for an emotional connection that's no longer present in their marriage, rather than out of a sexual need. Men are cheating from the heart because their emotional needs are not being met at home. 
<br />It’s always been taken as a given that men can more easily compartmentalize between sex and emotion than women but today, more and more men are increasingly less inclined to do so. Ironically, we live in an age where women not only enjoy the same economic independence as men, but also want to enjoy sex like men, and more and more married women are cheating as men always have.
<br />Meanwhile, men are increasingly cheating to have sex like women: as part of a broader emotional experience. 
<br />While most of the latest buzz has focused on the rise of female infidelity, and why women are cheating in droves, what's not being discussed is that men are cheating for the very same reasons: They see themselves as victims of desireless, sex-starved relationships that have become routine, over-stressed and devoid of genuine emotional intimacy. 
<br />While the feminist sexual revolution of the last 30 years has increasingly leveled the playing field between the sexes and empowered women to have sex like men, its cultural by-product has been the incessant chastising of men to “get in touch with their feelings” and become more sensitive. 
<br />Ironically, now that those men are in touch with their feelings, those emotional needs are not being met; hence, the emotional cheater. 
<br />At the same time, many women are fed up with relationships at home that are devoid of intimacy, and are finding that they receive the attention they desire at work. Hence, workplace flirtations are more than ever turning into full-blown affairs. Being “just friends” has become dangerous territory. 
<br />Both men and women are hungering for an emotional bond; in a culture where most divorces occur within the first four years of marriage, we’re more likely to declare our marriages broken than work on fixing them. 
<br />But female cheaters are more isolated than ever. While there’s a culture of forgiveness for the male cheater -- all one needs do is open the pages of Cosmo for a story on how to forgive and move on -- the female cheater is often demonized. The truth is that many men would like to forgive but don’t know how and have nowhere to turn.
<br /><br />While one out of two marriages end in divorce, with infidelity often being the catalyst, what’s more interesting is that most people end up remarrying only to divorce once again, with infidelity again being the catalyst. Our hearts are in the right place, but we keep making the same mistakes. 
<br />Why do we cheat? Out of sexual boredom? For the excitement of something new? Because we can get away with it? All that and more. Today’s Wonder Woman and Wonder Man are making time for everything but their relationships. Once we move past the infatuation stage of a relationship, sex has to keep growing as part of a broader emotional attachment. 
<br />But if we’re not nurturing each other emotionally, then the sex becomes routine and hollow, a dead end rather than an ongoing path, and we search for the sparks of desire through infidelity.

<br />Reviewer: Little Oracle
<br /><br />DON'T BE A DOORMAT
<br /><br />Basically, the author explains that women have been taught to be nurturers; A woman finds a man worth loving, showers everything and anything on them and *surprise!* they're abandoned. Why does this happen? Because women expect men to give back what they're giving them and it just doesn't work that way -- at least not in the beginning of any relationship -- it has to be built to that point (my parents were like this after years of marriage.) This extreme generosity on womens' parts comes across as if they're strictly living for their man's happiness (sometimes that's true, too, unfortunately) and unfortunately that tells the man that they're doormats. Plain and simple. 
<br />The book explains that men want an independent woman. They don't want a mother, a babysitter or a slave -- they lose interest in them way too fast and the mystery is gone. Sounds easy enough to understand but if you read the examples and follow a few tips you'll be very surprised with the results. 
<br />For example, the old telephone bit. DON'T wait by the telephone for the guy you're seeing. Go out, have a life outside of him and call back when it fits YOUR schedule, not his. Don't rearrange your plans around him and most of all don't leave all decisions up to him. I've had friends I'm with that when the phone rings, they ignore all their guests to go suck up to the guy they're after on the phone. Wrong. You make time for your man when you have the time -- not stopping your life. 
<br />The two things I was surprised to discover is: 1.) Women have been taught in the past that appearance is everything they need to find a man -- and nothing else matters. No wonder women have been treated like doormats! If personality and ambition are ignored there's nothing left but appearance and 2.) Women need to be taught to have a life outside of their boyfriends/mates/husbands. Women have been taught by society that they need a man to complete their lives SO MUCH that they end up desperate and it shows to the man they're dating. Plus, it's the reason you feel that emptiness in a relationship -- you've lived so much for him that you forgot about yourself. It's really sad when you realize how passive society has made women unconsciously or consciously and you need to take that back. 
<br />I'll give you an example I used: A guy who asked me out called me up and said: &quot;Well, you can drive over here since I'm closer to where we're going.&quot; The passive/old me who was desperate would say: &quot;Okay! Anything to make you happy because God forbid, I don't want to lose you -- that's how desperate I am.&quot; What I said instead was: &quot;No, you asked me out so come pick me up.&quot; Lo and behold what did he do? He picked me up. Don't be afraid to put your foot down -- of course, be cool about it, not nasty and it ALWAYS works. 
<br />Making plans? Don't drop them because he asked you out, plan around him. I have a friend who lives for her boyfriend and really could use this book but she's so far gone that I've given up hope. I can't tell you how many times she's cancelled on me at the last second because he decided he wanted to go out at that time. Wrong. You hate when your friends do that to you and you're disgusted with them for their attitudes -- so why on earth would you do it? Besides, he's more likely to call back when you don't offer everything on a platter at once -- including your heart; You lose mystery with him when you do that and he loses interest. 
<br />Then we come to a very important chapter: If he knows you're not putting him in a cage -- he'll try and put you in one. This is where the mother/babysitter aspect comes in. He calls the shots -- with everything. What movies you watch, where you go, how you live your life and quite frankly this is where women get into relationships and suddenly realize they're unhappy -- but don't know why. It's because they've made themselves become little slaves to their men's happiness and they're not getting it back. In my opinion, if you're in this kind of a relationship it's hardly fixable but there are ways around that. Another example in the book was one woman let a man do his wash at her place and he ended up expecting her to do it all the time. He would just bring it over and not even ask. So, one time she dropped a pair of red panties in with his whites and when everything came out pink she said: &quot;Oh, I'm just not good at this kind of thing.&quot; What was the result? He said: &quot;You are NEVER doing my wash again.&quot; Problem solved. 
<br />In fact, I gave this to my mother (who is a widow dating) and she was very surprised to realize how much advantage her boyfriend was taking over her. He would plan parties at HER HOUSE and she would do all the cooking and he never helped her pay for any of it. When she began to protest, he fought her on it. What ended up happening is she booted him out the door. In some instances, like I said, it's not fixable. But, was he worth keeping? She decided &quot;No&quot; and she has told me she is much happier. 
<br />Have a guy tell you that he wants to see you and other people? Don't get on the floor and beg for him -- tell him: &quot;Don't let the door hit you on the ***. I had one guy do that to me. We went out and he told me that he was going to see this girl he knew at work. So, when we were driving back to my place I said: &quot;I understand about your needs to see other people,&quot; and he nodded and got this smile on his face. Then I said: &quot;So since you're going to see someone else on Saturday I just wanted you to know that I have a date, too.&quot; That smile melted off his face so fast I could have died laughing. What ended up happening? He was so distracted by the fact that I was going out on a date that he didn't enjoy his at all. The VERY next morning he called immediately and asked if I wanted to go out. I hemmed and hawed and said: &quot;Well, I'm pretty tired from last night, so no, but I can go out Monday evening.&quot; I was showered with attention Monday. Trust me - it works. 
<br />Now, in defense of some of the male postings here (which make me laugh of course) NOT ALL MEN ARE LIKE THIS. But unfortunately, there are guys out there who are. Think of this book as a great guideline to weed those out. If guys like this are playing games, the best thing to do is to play YOUR WAY. You may not end up with the right guy if you have to but your self esteem won't be shot in the end when it's over and that little player will have learned something. Real men DON'T play these games, but do love independence in women. 
<br />The only chapter I don't agree with would be the one on faking an orgasm once you get to an intimate point in the relationship. If you can't be honest with your lover and are more worried about his ego then you're setting a trap for yourself. Healthy, sexual relationships are all about honesty -- each of you telling each other what you want. Neither one of you are going to figure it out eventually. That never happens. I got this info from &quot;Mars and Venus in the Bedroom&quot; which you can find on Amazon.com. Explain what works, what doesn't, don't be harsh about it and it will all fall into place. Trust me on this one. 
<br />So get this book if you've had your heart broken too many times. Remember, not all guys are like this but you can figure out which ones are (and... have a little fun with them in the meantime *devil grin here*) Real men don't play games with women and you'll figure out the real men from the weasels with this book. A MUST READ for you women out there sick of the games -- play them your own way! And trust me, it works!
<br /><br />A MAN'S PERSPECTIVE ON THIS BOOK
<br />Reviewer: A reader
<br /><br />As a man who read this book, I have a new understanding of how and why my last girlfriend acted the way she did. She must have read this book! 
<br />I have to say, I chased after her, just like the book says a man will do if you follow the rules it describes. But, (and this is a big BUT), eventually, I got tired of chasing her. Eventually I came to the huge realization that I didn't want to live the rest of my life this way, under her thumb, with her making all the rules for our relationship. 
<br />Women have put up with men that act this way, and it drives you crazy, doesn't it? Don't you hate it when a guy doesn't call and acts like other things are more important than you are? This book could just as well have been written for men, and been titled, &quot;Why Women Love Jerks.&quot; 
<br />As I read this book, I thought that if everyone, men and women alike, followed the rules contained in it, this world would be full of a lot of single people. Mainly because it's all about one person in the relationship (in this case, women) acting aloof, not chasing men, and not showing men that they're afraid to lose them. If both sexes acted this way, no one would get in a relationship because both would never chase the other. (In the hopes that the other one will first. It's not going to happen!) 
<br />All in all, this book seems to be written for women who have been hurt badly in the past and don't want to be hurt (or at least show that they're hurt) again. Anyone who has ever had the good fortune to have been in a GOOD relationship would never think of treating their mate like Sherry Argov suggests. 
<br />I gave this book 2 stars, because what's in it WILL work. But if you have to use &quot;trickery&quot; like this to get a man to chase you, you'll get a relationship to match. It's better to be honest with one another. If it doesn't work out, then move on until you find that NICE person who will treat you right, &quot;games&quot; or not!
