<br /><br />RTA:<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Halloween is a celebration of Anglo-Saxon culture that is celebrated on the night of October 31.
<br />Its origins date back to the Celts over 2500 years ago, when the Celtic year ended in late summer, on October 31 on our calendar (Samhain). The cattle were brought from the pastures to the stables for the winter. That last day, it was assumed that the spirits could leave the cemetery and take over the bodies of living to rise, asking food and cursing. They were victims of spells if they agreed to their demands: give me something or do something naughty, which is the translation of &quot;Trick or Treat (Trick or Treat).
<br /><br />To avoid this, the Celtic villages and houses littered the &quot;decorated&quot; with bones, skulls and other unpleasant things, so that the dead spend long scared. Hence the tradition of decorating houses with sinister motives in the current eve of All Saints and costumes. It is therefore a party associated with the coming of the pagan gods to life.
<br />The church of Rome decided to convert to Catholicism holiday. Was instituted on 1 November as All Saints Day, which in England is called &quot;All Hallows 'Day&quot;, and the night before &quot;All Hallows' Eve&quot; which later led to &quot;Halloween.&quot;
<br /><br />The party was exported to the United States by European immigrants in the nineteenth century, around 1846. However, no mass was first celebrated in 1921. That year was the first Halloween parade in Minnesota and then was followed by other states. The internationalization of Halloween came in the late '70s and early '80s thanks to movies and television series.
<br /><br />At present, children dress for the occasion and walk through the streets trick or treating from door to door. After knocking on the door children uttered the phrase &quot;Trick or treat.&quot; If adults give them candy, money or any other type of reward, is interpreted to have accepted the deal. If instead they refuse, the boys spend a little joke.
<br /><br />Halloween is a party based on fear, death, undead, black magic and mystical monsters. The &quot;characters&quot; that are usually associated with Halloween include ghosts, witches, black cats, goblins, the banshees, zombies and demons as well as certain literary figures such as Dracula and Frankenstein's monster.
<br />The Celts used to dress in animal skins on October 31 and thus avoid detection by the spirits, they say, comes alive that night. Hence the current practice of dressing up that day. The traditional colors of Halloween are black of night and the orange of the first light of day. Halloween symbols also include elements such as pumpkins and autumn scarecrows.

<br /><br />Tell me what you dress up and tell you what you get
<br /><br />If the children's game is, as Margaret Lowenfeld, author of the &quot;Bibles&quot; of kindergartens, &quot;the expression of the child's relationship with the totality of life, dramatic play is one of the most direct routes . Just dress &quot;as a mom or dad&quot; to talk like them, challenge as they move like them.

<br /><br />Monkey:
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/es/p/oo/130296463_6595246_41369870.jpg" />
<br /><br />With a weight of one hundred and fifty and two hundred kilos in males is a stunning animal females are very promiscuous throughout the year and are in no stable relationship with males. Breeding chronology is very similar to humans, and after eight and half months of pregnancy give birth to a single calf, after a period of learning, and enjoy a relative independence within the clan.
<br /><br />The gorilla when it is struck, made ??a series of intimidatory gestures and attitudes that rarely pass over.
<br /><br />Their cries of defiance and beat their chests are just a way to release your stress. It really is not very aggressive.
<br /><br />Panels composed of a variable number of individuals wander through the jungle under the command of an adult male while eating or playing, and when night build a bedridden, more or less elaborate, where they will rest until the next day. Like many other primates.
<br /><br />Chamaleon:
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/es/p/oo/130296463_11634138_41370179.jpg" />
<br /><br />There are numerous species, some 160 or so, but all known for their ability to change color, not all species have this feature, independent eye movements and how to catch insects with its tongue. Are distributed almost everywhere but where to and may be more species in Africa in the south of the Sahara.
<br /><br />We will look at the top in size, range from 5cm. as Brookesia family, up to 60cm. as Calumna family. They may have different traits between species, with horns like jacksonii having three or yemen of the head with a helmet, but explain the general features.
<br /><br />Legs have two fingers arranged in a clamp fastened to the branches, each clip has 5 nails or claws arranged in groups of three and two, most of the species, if males have a sort of spur above yy clip on the back of the leg, lack of them females.
<br /><br />Snake:
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/es/p/oo/130296463_1145480_41370299.jpg" />
<br /><br />Yeah, well there are different species of snakes must say that they meet with similar characteristics and to keep in mind that they are all related to each other.
<br />Even many of the characteristics of snakes can come to resemble some reptiles that have nothing to do with them, such is the case of iguanas, where the scaly skin, and tongue, along with some capabilities developed senses . However, the physical structure of these animals is the characteristic of the snakes of all kinds, sizes and colors and to keep in mind that all have the same physical abilities, however, when habitat is the same here we find some differences, taking into account the preferences of each species.
<br /><br />Sea turtle:
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/es/p/oo/130296463_12320048_41370584.jpg" />
<br /><br />Sea turtles are reptiles with shells that have existed for more than 150 million years and survived all the changes the world.
<br />Originated on Earth, but gradually evolved and adapted to the marine environment, differing from other reptiles.
<br />There are eight species of sea turtles grouped into two families, and those of Cheloniidae Dermochelyidae and usually live in warm temperate seas. Of these species, five are located in Brazil. In the Andalusian coast are examples of two species, the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) and loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). The remaining species are the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, ridley, olive and Flatback turtle.
