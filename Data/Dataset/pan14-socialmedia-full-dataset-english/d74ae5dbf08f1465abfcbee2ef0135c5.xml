<br /><br />Mommy.. Johnny brought a gun to school,
<br />He told his friends that it was cool,
<br />And when he pulled the trigger back,
<br />It shot with a great crack.
<br />Mommy, I was a good girl, I did What I was told,
<br />I went to school, I got straight A's, I even got the gold!
<br />But Mommy, when I went to school that day,
<br />I never said good-bye,
<br />I'm sorry Mommy, I had to go, But Mommy, please don't cry.
<br />When Johnny shot the gun, He hit me and another,
<br />And all because Johnny, Got the gun from his older brother.
<br />Mommy, please tell Daddy; That I love him very much,
<br />And please tell Zack; my boyfriend; That it wasn't just a crush.
<br />And tell my little sister; That she is the only one now,
<br />And tell my dear sweet grandmother; I'll be waiting for her now,
<br />And tell my wonderful friends; That they always were the best;
<br />Mommy, I'm not the first, I'm no better than the rest.
<br />Mommy, tell my teachers; I won't show up for class,
<br />And never to forget this, And please don't let this pass.
<br />Mommy, why'd it have to be me? No one deserves this,
<br />Mommy, warn the others, Mommy I left without a kiss.
<br />And Mommy tell the doctors; I know they really did try,
<br />I think I even saw a doctor, Trying not to cry.
<br />Mommy, I'm slowly dying, With a bullet in my chest,
<br />But Mommy please remember, I'm in heaven with the rest;
<br />Mommy I ran as fast as I could,
<br />When I heard that crack, Mommy, listen to me if you would,
<br />I wanted to go to college, I wanted to try things that were new,
<br />I guess I'm not going with Daddy, On that trip to the new zoo.
<br />I wanted to get married, I wanted to have a kid,
<br />I wanted to be an actress, Mommy, I wanted to live.
<br />But Mommy I must go now, The time is getting late,
<br />Mommy, tell my Zack, I'm sorry but I had to cancel the date.
<br />I love you Mommy, I always have, I know; you know it's true,
<br />And Mommy all I say is, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />In Memory of The Columbine &amp; Virginia Tech Students Who Were Lost
<br /><br />Please if you would, Don't smash this on the ground. If you pass this on, Maybe people will cry, Just keep this in your heart, For the people who didn't get to say &quot;Good-bye&quot;.

<br /><br />I was born in 1989 but grew up in the 90's how great wer they!!!!!
<br />If you are under the age of 13...you should not read this
<br />and if you do, you should not repost this.
<br /><br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid.
<br /><br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons. I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it.
<br /><br />You're a 90's kid if:
<br /><br />You can finish this [ice ice _ _ _ _ ] 
<br /><br />You remember watching:
<br />-Doug
<br />-Ren &amp; Stimpy
<br />-Pinky and the Brain
<br /><br />You've ever ended a sentence with the word &quot;PSYCHE!&quot;
<br /><br />You just cant resist finishing this . . . &quot;Iiiiiiin west philidelphia born and raised . . .&quot; *sings*
<br /><br />You remember:
<br />-Dinosaurs,
<br />-Boy Meets World,

<br />on a Saturday to watch cartoons.
<br /><br />supermarket sweep.
<br /><br />You remember reading &quot;Goosebumps&quot;
<br /><br />You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school. 
<br /><br />You still get the urge to say &quot;NOT&quot; after (almost) every sentence . . . not
<br /><br />when everyhting was settled by:
<br />-rock paper scissors.
<br />-turn around, tutch the ground...
<br />-ip dip doo the cats got the flu...
<br /><br />when playing 'house' was a daily activity.
<br /><br />when we played Hide and seek/kiss catch until our legs grew numb.
<br /><br />when we used to obey our parents
<br /><br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time.
<br /><br />Captain Planet. He's a Hero. 
<br /><br />You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the green ranger, were meant to be together. ???
<br /><br />when daytime t.v was all learning stuff for kids, that your parents made you watch if you stayed off school.
<br /><br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genisis became popular.
<br /><br />You always wanted to send in a tape to britain's Funniest Home Videos . . . but never taped anything funny.
<br /><br />You remember watching Home Alone 1, 2 , and 3 . . . and tried to pull the pranks on &quot;intruders&quot;
<br /><br />You remember watching:
<br />-The Magic roundabout
<br />-kipper the dog
<br />-button moon

<br />-Aladdin
<br />-Ninja Turtles
<br />-3 Ninjas movies.
<br /><br />when starburst were called opalfruits.
<br /><br />If you remember when every thing was &quot;da BOMB!&quot;
<br /><br />When they made the new lunchables so that you could make pizza AND tacos.
<br /><br />...and even the boys loved steps and spice girls.
<br /><br />You remember boom boxes vs. cd players.
<br /><br />Making those little paper fortune cookie things, and then predicting your life with them.
<br /><br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot; 
<br /><br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere.
<br /><br />. . . Furbies. 
<br /><br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the internet.
<br /><br />And Windows 95 was the best.
<br /><br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, and Ninja Turtles.
<br /><br />Michael Jordan was a king.
<br /><br />YIKES pencils and erasers were the stuff!
<br /><br />You remember when the new Beanie Babies and Talking Elmo were always sold out
<br /><br />You collected those Beanie Babies.
<br /><br />Carebears.
<br /><br />Gap was the coolest stuff invented.
<br /><br />You had a pair of popper trackies.
<br /><br />Jellybean shoes.
<br /><br />Everything was inflatable from bags, chairs, sofas, aliens...
<br /><br />Coats were puffy and aluminous.
<br /><br />You could by everything with £1.
<br /><br />The old, old £20
<br /><br />oasis was the 'new' thing.
<br /><br />You collected all the Troll dolls
<br /><br />If you even know what an original walkman is.
<br /><br />You remember wanting to sit on the orange Nickelodeon couch.
<br /><br />You've gotten creeped out by &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;
<br /><br />You know the Macarena by heart. 
<br /><br />&quot;Talk to the hand&quot; . . . enough said
<br /><br />You always said, &quot;Then why don't you marry it!&quot;
<br /><br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace.
<br /><br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground.
<br /><br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . .
<br /><br />Before the Internet &amp; text messaging . . .
<br /><br />Before creatives &amp; iPods . . .
<br /><br />Before emos and chavs. . . :S
<br /><br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . .
<br /><br />Before Spongebob . . .
<br /><br />Back when you put off the 5 hours of homework you had every night.
<br /><br />When light up trainers were cool.
<br /><br />When everyone wore visors.
<br /><br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs.
<br /><br />Caller ID was a new thing.
<br /><br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs.
<br /><br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkman.
<br /><br />When checking out drawing books and that one book about the rainbow fish from the library was THE cool thing to do.
<br /><br />You had slap braclets!
<br /><br />Way back.
<br /><br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear.
<br /><br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!
<br /><br />Post this in your bulletin if you remember these days . . . .

<br />15 minutes ago 
<br />Guy: &quot;Can we have sex right now?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school (which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care
