Subjects that used interval training had better results. They lost more fat. You can't argue with that.<br /><br />And second, interval training causes metabolic turbulence - also<br />&lt;br&gt;known as boost in your metabolism. Due to the high-intensity nature of intervals, there is more &quot;turbulence&quot; applied to the muscle. That means more muscle breakdown and more adaptations in the muscle.<br /><br />Now I know that sounds very technical, but all you need to<br />&lt;br&gt;understand is that when all this extra activity goes on at the<br />&lt;br&gt;muscle level, it requires a lot more energy to return your muscle back to normal (i.e. to get out of turbulence and back to a normal resting state).<br /><br />And when your body uses more energy, it means, in laymen's terms, that you are burning more calories.<br /><br />So it's important for men and women not too get hung up on the<br />&lt;br&gt;calorie counters in the gym. First, because the calorie count of<br />&lt;br&gt;the workout is not the only factor in determining fat loss<br />&lt;br&gt;(intervals burn far more calories after the workout - more on that later).<br /><br />And second, a report on CBS showed that the calorie counters on some machines are often significantly inaccurate.<br /><br />Doesn't that boil your blood when you think back to all those times you did slow, boring cardio and patiently watched the calorie counter creep up to your goal of 250, 300, or even 400 calories? And who knows if that was even accurate?<br /><br />With intervals, you can forget about the calories on the machine.<br />&lt;br&gt;Just work hard, do the intervals, then leave the gym and let your muscles continue burning calories on its own while it recovers from exercise.<br /><br />OK, time is up, so I'm going to leave off here for Part 1.<br /><br />I apologize, you don't have your Master's of Science Degree in<br />&lt;br&gt;Interval Training yet, but you will after Part 2.<br /><br />So your homework between now and next week's class is to start incorporating interval training into your fat loss program. For beginners, see the outline above. Make sure to include a 5-minute specific warm-up and cool-down.<br /><br />And if you truly did just peel yourself off the couch last week and you have not exercised in years, I insist that you see a doctor before you take up any exercise program. Believe me, you'll thank yourself for it.<br /><br />For more advanced fitness levels, let's start with 60 second<br />&lt;br&gt;intervals.<br /><br />Do a 5-minute specific warm-up, then exercise for 60 seconds at a slightly harder than normal cardio pace.<br /><br />Follow that with 90 seconds of exercise at a very easy pace. (Don't exercise too hard in the recovery period - that is one of the biggest mistakes people make with interval training!). <br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Beginners, intermediate, and Advanced User Guides.<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; FLF Grocery List and Recipes eBook.<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; A fool-proof guide to achieve your goals in losing weight and shaping up.<br /><br />In conclusion, Fat Loss Factor Program is the no-frill system that helps you achieve your definition of ideal body weight and size through a combined exercise and eating regimen that are based on logical premises.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NsYXJlbmNlbGF3czI0LmJyYXZlam91cm5hbC5jb20vZW50cnkvOTExMTY_" target="_blank">weight loss</a>, [url=]muscle gain[/url], <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211c2NsZWdhaW41Ni53ZXRwYWludC5jb20vcGFnZS9EcitNaWNoYWVsK0FsbGVuJTI3cytGYXQrTG9zcytGYWN0b3IrUmV2aWV3Ky0rQ291bGQrSXQrQmUrQStHaW1taWNrJTNG" target="_blank">Dr Michael Allen's Fat Loss Factor Review - Could It Be A Gimmick?</a>

Personally, I believe intervals are<br />&lt;br&gt;far superior. And there is no denying that intervals allow you to<br />&lt;br&gt;get your workouts done a lot faster than slow, boring cardio<br />&lt;br&gt;workouts.<br /><br />2) I have to admit, there is no best interval training program for<br />&lt;br&gt;fat loss. But that is a good thing, because there are so many waysv that you can change your interval training to keep your fat loss results coming week in and week out.<br /><br />By changing your training program every three to four weeks, you are using one of the key principles of Turbulence Training - variety. It is essential to change your workouts this frequently, otherwise you might suffer from a dreaded fat loss plateau.<br /><br />And if that is the case for you now, I'll show you dozens of<br />&lt;br&gt;alternative interval training workouts you can use to kick-start<br />&lt;br&gt;your metabolism and fat loss.<br /><br />Now what many people don't know, or perhaps just fail to recognize, is that interval training is not just for advanced fitness superstars. No way. In fact, intervals are an effective and perhaps even the most effective method for beginners to get fit and lose fat.<br /><br />First you have to understand that interval training is based on<br />&lt;br&gt;relative performance. While my intervals would be much too hard for a beginner, my intervals would be a joke for Lance Armstrong.<br /><br />So even for those men and women that are just dipping their toe<br />&lt;br&gt;into the fitness waters for the first time in months, years, or<br />&lt;br&gt;dare I say, decades, they too can do interval training.<br /><br />If you are a beginner and you can walk at 3.3mph for 20 minutes, then your intervals will start at a walk at 3.6mph for 30 seconds to a minute. That is interval training.<br /><br />It doesn't have to be high-intensity, sprint-to-the-death activity.<br /><br />Instead, just increase the intensity slightly more than you can<br />&lt;br&gt;normally handle, and do so for a short time, and intersperse that<br />&lt;br&gt;with periods of easier exercise for twice the duration.<br /><br />So if you did 1 minute at 3.6mph, drop down to 3.0mph for 2<br />&lt;br&gt;minutes. Do that up to 6 times, and you've had yourself an interval session.<br /><br />Now for those of you that have been doing only slow, traditional<br />&lt;br&gt;cardio, switching over to interval training 2-3 times per week is<br />&lt;br&gt;going to be the fat loss equivalent of throwing a lit, gasoline<br />&lt;br&gt;soaked rag on a pile of dry kindling.<br /><br />Here's why...research has given us a lot of evidence that intervals are superior to traditional cardio. First, a study from Laval University in 1994 compared interval training to aerobic training - straight up - over a 12 week training period. Subjects that used interval training had better results. If you do all these four, then you are sure to have a flat and fabulous belly that is ready for a belly ring accessory.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdWtlYm94YWxpdmUuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2Jsb2dfaWQ9ODM0NTMzMw__" target="_blank">weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JhZGlvanV2ZW50dXNkb25ib3Njby5jb20vMjAxMi8wNC8xMC90aGUtYmVzdC1jYXJkaW8tZm9yLWZhdC1sb3NzLw__" target="_blank">Push Button &amp;quot;Fat Loss&amp;quot;</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NvZG1nLmNvbS9tZW1iZXIvY2xhcmVuY2VsYXdzMjQvYmxvZy81MzAyNy9UaGUtRmF0LUxvc3MtRmFjdG9yLVJldmlldy0tLVByb3MtJTI2YW1wJTNCLUNvbnMtT2YtRHItTWljaGFlbC1BbGxlbiUyN3MtUHJvZ3JhbQ__" target="_blank">The Fat Loss Factor Review - Pros &amp;amp; Cons Of Dr Michael Allen's Program</a>

This way, your meat will not be filled with so much oil or in other words fats. The next thing will be to decide how many servings you should eat for every viand or snack meal. By the way, one serving of meat is not anymore one matchbox but the size of an average man's palm. Before you decide how many servings, you should be able to know how many calories are there in every meal. (Knowing how many calories you eat will help you become more conscious of what you're eating. It means you have a mindset of eating less.) The recommended caloric restriction in a day to lose weight should be 500 to 1000 calories less than your recommended daily calories. With everything planned, all you have to do is stick with it.<br /><br />To get that extra kick of losing that fat:<br /><br />To boost your weight loss efforts, you do should do exercises like biking, swimming, aerobics, and sports like tennis, basketball, soccer and many others.

The results show that although diet alone can result to weight loss, it is incomparably less efficient than the combination of diet and exercise. It takes longer to lose weight if only diet is used. Diet and exercise should be combined in order to get results fast.<br /><br />Having said all that, a word of advice for you is to stick with this abdominal fat loss diet plan and you are sure to achieve your sought-after weight objective.<br /><br />Fat Loss Factor Program has gained quite a huge following, and has been very successful among people who want to lose weight.

Dr. Allan himself had struggled with his weight before discovering a solution based from a principle that dates back to the 1950s.

He has helped a lot of people in achieving their dream body weight and shape through his intensive program.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Why is Fat Loss Factor an Effective Weight Loss Program?&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Having a fatty liver is the main reason why people are obese.

Today, you're going to<br />&lt;br&gt;leave this email with a graduate degree in interval training for<br />&lt;br&gt;fat loss.<br /><br />I'll answer both questions upfront before the lesson begins, and<br />&lt;br&gt;I'll give more details on each as we go along:<br /><br />1) Conservatively, intervals are at least as effective as regular<br />&lt;br&gt;aerobic training for fat loss. Personally, I believe intervals are<br />&lt;br&gt;far superior. You need to make big changes to your lifestyle and incorporate some type of physical activity. Losing weight is not just about dieting but also making time for some form of exercise, whether it's walking, jogging or heavy lifting.<br /><br />When you first look at the food lovers fat loss system, the program can can seem a little unrealistic. The system says you can eat all of your favorites foods and still lose all of your weight. This seems like the total opposite of what we've learned in the past. Dieting is always associated with starving ourselves or taking drastic measures and eating foods we dislike.<br /><br />When you look at the food lovers Fat Loss System more closely, it's more than your typical lose weight program. This system teaches you how to eat better and make smart choices to your lifestyle. The program does not revolve around making unrealistic goals, or depriving yourself of certain foods. You don't have to take diet pills or resort to fasting.<br /><br />It's about making simple tweaks to the foods that you currently eat now in a way that helps lower your blood sugar and put your body into a fat burning mode. Each day you learn one NEW technique about eating better and about your metabolism, like the difference between slow carbs and fast carbs and and how to kick-start your metabolism into a fat burning machine.<br /><br />Remember, that losing weight is a two step process. Once you lose the weight, you have to really strive to keep the weight off. Find a system that works for you, stay committed and make it happen!<br /><br />That eye-grabbing headline was so tempting I couldn't resist. It just dragged me into the copy.<br /><br />So how was the article.<br /><br />A complete waste of time. But it sure left me thinking...<br /><br />...&quot;Is there really such a thing as PUSH BUTTON FAT LOSS?<br /><br />Or was that headline simply too good to be true?&quot;<br /><br />The answer is, it all depends on your definition of &quot;Push Button&quot;.<br /><br />If your definition is simply swallowing some diet pill and watching your disgusting stomach fat magically melt away in a single day, then I'm afraid the answer is no. (At least I haven't found anything like that yet. If you are consuming a lot of the wrong foods then you might not have much success with this technique.<br /><br />But who knows, this little gem of a secret just may give you the fat loss you're looking for.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MjMzMjk1MCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03MjAyNDczJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9Y2xhcmVuY2VsYXdzMjQmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzIwMjQ3MyZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9Y2xhcmVuY2VsYXdzMjQ_" target="_blank">weight loss</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5hdG9tLmNvbS9Qb3N0L0JlbGx5LUZhdC1Mb3NzLWZvci1NZW4tRWZmZWN0aXZlLVRpcHMvMDNFRkJGRkZGMDI3OTI3QTUwMDA4MDE5QkI5NDc_" target="_blank">muscle gain</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NsYXJlbmNlbGF3czI0LnhhbmdhLmNvbS83NjEyMjI1ODQvZmF0LWxvc3Mv" target="_blank">fat loss</a>

A simple removal of one item from your diet over the next few weeks.<br /><br />And chances are that item accounts for a rather large percentage of your daily caloric intake.<br /><br />So what is it?<br /><br />Bread.<br /><br />The vast majority of your excess fat can be attributed to relatively few things that you are consuming.<br /><br />What I found is that bread was one of those &quot;few things&quot; for me. I was consuming a lot of bread throughout the day (toast, sandwiches... etc.) and this was providing my body with such and over-abundance of starchy carbs that it was making fat loss very difficult.<br /><br />Here's exactly what I did:<br /><br />I simply stopped eating bread and left the rest of my diet the same. Within two weeks I was noticing a substantial reduction in body fat.<br /><br />Now, I certainly don't claim that this will work for everyone.<br /><br />Especially for those who believe that the most effective way to lose weight is by eliminating all carbohydrates (They are their own worst enemies.).<br /><br />And please note, my diet was already pretty good.
