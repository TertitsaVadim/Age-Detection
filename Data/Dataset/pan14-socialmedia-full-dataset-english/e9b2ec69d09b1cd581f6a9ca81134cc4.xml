Whether it is a costume for you, your kids or any member of the family, you won't be left without any selection.<br /><br />Masks are one of the favorite costume options for everyone. The reason is that they are relatively cheap, easy to use and there is always such a great selection of masks to choose from. You can opt for the most frightening Halloween costume ideas such as the Walking Dead Decayed Head Piece mask (new for 2011) or a less scary option like the Sarah Palin mask. A Halloween mask is an easy option if you have been dreaming of looking like a movie character you have fallen in love with. Masks imitating characters from X-Men, The Lord of the Rings and Batman are just some of the choices you have.<br /><br />You may choose to buy a full outfit if you desire a more dramatic result. A few of your choices are the vampire, skeleton and sorcerer costumes. There are also several lines of costumes especially for babies and kids to wear for this holiday. Infants would look scary in a Scout the Scarecrow and Witch costume, among others. You will also be delighted to know that your pet won't need to miss out with there also being plenty of costume options for pets this Halloween. Examples of these are Dracula Dog costume, The Frankenstein Monster and The Wolf Man Pet costumes.<br /><br />Don't forget the numerous accessories that can be bought from online shops. Halloween hats or wigs abound on internet sites this year. If you are hosting the party, don't forget to buy party supplies and games specifically made for Halloween. The key is searching for the right seller to buy from.<br /><br />Try to look for a retailer that has wide selection, great prices and terms and the best customer service. Remember that you can only get to celebrate Halloween once a year, so you should give it plenty of thought and consideration when researching the best costume to wear.<br /><br />It is never too early to start thinking about what your kids or you yourself will be wearing for Halloween. That is the one time of year where you can be anything or anyone you want, and no one will think you are too weird. Checking out the best Halloween costumes for 2011 brings some old and some new favorites together for all ages to enjoy.<br /><br />The one theme that has been so popular recently is vampires. Everywhere you look, you see a movie, a TV show, or a new book about vampires out. It is no wonder that the majority of popular costumes are centered around vampires then. The best thing is how they have evolved. Not only do you have your traditional vampire but you also have the Gothic and elite styles to choose from for all ages.<br /><br />Kids Halloween costumes always come in a selection from their favorite cartoon characters to firefighters to superheroes. Despite the vampires taking over, witches will also have a part in kid's outfits this year. This really stands out and makes a great impression at a party as it's pretty original.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FTripView.aspx%3FTripID%3D106525"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogabond.com/TripView.aspx?TripID=106525</a>

For authenticity, consider shopping at a second hand store or consignment shop, as a number of hipsters often shop at these locations. When in doubt of what to wear, Google's image search, and YouTube videos should provide references.<br /><br />Want to be sexy this Halloween? Whether you're looking to be someone other than yourself, or you're looking to flaunt what you do daily, sexy costumes are wildly popular. And, they should be. Sex sells, and sex appeal is a big part of our economy. So why not be sexy for Halloween?<br /><br />If you're looking for a sexy costume, a pre made costume, purchasable costume is ideal. In fact, you can get a great costume for fairly inexpensive these days, thanks to the internet. Once you've decided on a costume, just go to Google and type in &quot;sexy costume&quot; with costume being what you want. You'll get lots of options, including websites that can showcase some of the best costumes, and give the benefits and drawbacks of each.<br /><br />Still not sure what kind of costume you want? Check out the three options we present below, and see if one strikes your fancy. Remember, there's a lot of costumes out there, and we're only showcasing a few of the sexiest.<br /><br />1. French Maid. French Maids are sexy, largely because they're considered a fetish. Playboy had French maid comics, there's French Maid TV, and it's a costume showcased in adult stores. There's something about that black and white outfit. You don't see a lot of French maids, so it's a sexy costume option that isn't overdone. Make sure to find yourself a pair of shorts to wear under your costume, and complete the outfit with a feather duster and the highest heels you can manage. The duster might be a prop, but if anyone has doubts about what you were, it cinches it. And heels always help any sexy costume.<br /><br />2. Can Can Dancer. A Can Can Dancer, or a Saloon girl, is another costume you almost never see, but is a great sexy choice. They're beautiful dresses, made of shiny materials in bright colours, and usually trimmed with lace, making them feminine and sexy. And, they usually have the added bonus of a longer skirt in back, so if you're worried about the state of your rear, your costume has you covered. Literally. Plus,they often have cute headpieces with saucy feathers. Just make sure to practice a couple kicks, because once people see the costume, they're going to want you to perform for them.<br /><br />3. Little Red Riding Hood. Remember the fairy tale? Red Riding Hood takes her grandmother a basket, only to end up meeting the Big Bad Wolf in the guise of grandma? Well, when lil Red's all grown up, that outfits begs to be made sexy. And it can be. Short red skirts and capes paired with thigh highs and heels will have the wolf begging to eat you. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogabond.com%2FTripView.aspx%3FTripID%3D106525"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogabond.com/TripView.aspx?TripID=106525</a>

This year men will find that the Scream ensemble is back to create a little party terror. But they will also find pirate and superhero outfits filling the racks. Captain America is making his comeback, and many men will enjoy being their favorite superhero for a night.<br /><br />When it comes to women's Halloween costumes, they range from the modest to the uber sexy today. Two popular outfits already eyed up by many are the Alice in Wonderland, modest and sexy version, and the Queen of Hearts ensemble. With the return of Wonder Woman to the limelight, many women will gravitate to a powerful, yet sexy look during the witching season. For those that like to show it off, the sexy nurse, pirate, and French maid will have a new addition added to their lineup: the sexy sailor.<br /><br />Time flies and before you know it, summer is over, and it is time to think about who you want to pretend to be this autumn. Now is the time to start planning and thinking about whether you are vampire or superhero material. Whatever you decide, Halloween costumes for 2011 are going to be exciting and fun for adults and kids alike.<br /><br />It might feel like we just ended Christmas and you might still be hungover from a raucous New Year's Eve celebration, but for the elves working hard at Plum Drama, it's never too early to start planning your Halloween costumes for 2011.  We just introduced this new category to our website a few months ago, but we are already seeing a great deal of interest from our web visitors in this category and with thousands of costumes to choose from, all in stock and ready to ship, we envision 2011 to be the year that costumes from Plum Drama really took hold.  To that end, we put together this buyer's guide on tips to consider when selecting your Halloween costumes for 2011.<br /><br />Pick the right size.  I can already see the no-duh meter hitting an all time high with this suggestion, but oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best.  When it comes to deciding on your Halloween costumes for 2011, don't forget about fit.  If you come up with the best, most original or entertaining idea, but it's not avaialable in your size, forget about it and move on.  I've heard too many horror stories about kids who trip over their costumes all night long, or grown-ups who buy something so tight, they can't eat at the Halloween party they're attending.  Don't be one of the many who report a nightmare story like this and make sure you order a size that actually fits.  Believe me, the trade off between a Halloween costume that fits correctly and one that's just a great idea, but in totally the wrong size, always err toward the correct size.<br />   Determine if you'll be inside or outside.  Again.  Another basic one. This really stands out and makes a great impression at a party as it's pretty original.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloweencostumes.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FHalloween_-_Cool_Candy_Treats"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloweencostumes.wikia.com/wiki/Halloween_-_Cool_Candy_Treats</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D567719%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dhalloween42costu22%26amp%3Bpassword%3D31033135U3ej7pu8Q99255.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dblog"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=567719&amp;sitename=halloween42costu22&amp;password=31033135U3ej7pu8Q99255.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=blog</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getjealous.com%2Fhalloween42costu%2Fjournal%2F2003233%2Fhalloween-fancy-dress-costumes-2010.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.getjealous.com/halloween42costu/journal/2003233/halloween-fancy-dress-costumes-2010.html</a>

		<document id="2963fbf7a160c44c20bf4b6e9bfeda51" url=""><![CDATA[Cool Halloween Costume Ideas For Looking Hip<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsdale wrote award winning poetry and short stories, she won two awards. Nicolas Cage, and Barrack Obama are admitted comic book nerds. With all the famous nerds out there, you'll be in good company if you choose this for your Halloween costume.<br /><br />When it comes down to selecting your nerd Halloween costume, if you want to avoid the hassle of creating your own costume, you can easily find what you're looking for online. You can select a simple costume like Harry Potter, Where's Waldo or Ugly Betty, or opt for a generic one and add your own flair to the nerd costume. Whatever you choose, it is sure to be a hit because Halloween is the time where everyone loves a nerd.<br /><br />So, you want a killer costume for Halloween or another event, but you're not very crafty? Trying for something people will talk about, but don't have a very big budget, or a lot of time? I can relate. Some of my favorite costumes were cobbled together using what I had at home, or a quick trip to a second hand store for a few items.<br /><br />So, to help you out, since I'm so nice, I've cobbled together five quick and easy costumes that even those who aren't very crafty can make. They don't cost much, and they can be put together pretty quickly.<br /><br />1. Doctor or Surgeon. Hit up the second hand store and look for either a set scrubs, or a white lab coat. If you manage a white lab coat, check around and see if you can find a real or toy stethoscope at the second hand store. If not, hit up your local big box and look for one in the toy section. If you managed to score scrubs, head to your local big box store, and pick up a disposable paper mask, and some rubber gloves. Now you have a quick costume that's not uncomfortable.<br /><br />2. Flasher: Visit the second hand store and pick up an inexpensive overcoat, something that falls to your knees or lower. Then, depending on how detailed you want to get, you can either wear underwear only, and flash people, or wear shorts and a t shirt underneath. Bonus option: find a flesh coloured leotard (second hand stores usually have them) and find a speedo or some other form of underwear. It'll give your friends a real shock when you flash them.<br /><br />3. Cereal Killer. Either buy a pack of those little cereal boxes, or grab a couple big boxes from home. Find some plastic knives, and stick at least one knife into each cereal box. Use some red paint, and paint drips down the boxes and is on the knives. Attach them to your clothes, big safety pins will work. Consider taking the bags of cereal out of the boxes before attaching, they can weigh your costume down.<br /><br />4. Mario. Why not choose Mario from Super Mario Brothers? Buy overalls, a red turtleneck, white gloves, and a red baseball cap or trucker hat at a second hand store. Paint a white circle with a red M on the hat. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloweencostumes.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FHalloween_-_Cool_Candy_Treats"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloweencostumes.wikia.com/wiki/Halloween_-_Cool_Candy_Treats</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getjealous.com%2Fhalloween42costu%2Fjournal%2F2003233%2Fhalloween-fancy-dress-costumes-2010.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.getjealous.com/halloween42costu/journal/2003233/halloween-fancy-dress-costumes-2010.html</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogbud.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Findex.pl%3Fpoemnumber%3D567719%26amp%3Bsitename%3Dhalloween42costu22%26amp%3Bpassword%3D31033135U3ej7pu8Q99255.3103%26amp%3Bpoemoffset%3D0%26amp%3Bdisplaypoem%3Dt%26amp%3Bitem%3Dblog"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blogbud.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=567719&amp;sitename=halloween42costu22&amp;password=31033135U3ej7pu8Q99255.3103&amp;poemoffset=0&amp;displaypoem=t&amp;item=blog</a>

Find a ring with a huge fake diamond on it, and a small trophy. Put the trophy on a ribbon or chain about your neck, and smile widely at everyone as you hang off your husband's arm, flashing your ring.<br /><br />He may not be the biggest, bloodiest, or most intimidating horror movie villain, but Chucky the doll has still traumatized millions of movie-goers with just a few words.<br /><br />&quot;Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?&quot;<br /><br />Two decades of children have lived in fear of those words. Two decades have seen him slice through everything from movies to haunted houses to Halloween outfits.<br /><br />With red hair, blue overalls, and tiny little sneakers, Chucky could be a remnant from any toy chest, a piece of history from any childhood playtime, only games have always been the last thing on his agenda.<br /><br />Originally released in 1988, &quot;Child's Play&quot; was conceived as a psychological thriller rather than a slasher flick. Writer/director Don Mancini wanted to examine the effects of advertising and commercialism on young children, with Chucky - a young boy's doll - serving as a focal point for the world's wicked ways.<br /><br />In the film, Chucky is gifted to Andy, a lonely six year old. Then Andy's caretakers start dying one by one. Despite Chucky's bloody legacy, the first film plays coy with his true nature; he isn't seen killing anyone until well into the movie, leading audiences to wonder if Andy himself is the culprit.<br /><br />These days, of course, the idea that Chucky is &quot;just a doll&quot; is laughable. More than a character or a message, he's a brand in his own right. &quot;Child's Play&quot; has spawned countless sequels, spinoffs, games, toys, and Halloween outfits, each bloodier and more memorable than the last. Chucky stands at the helm of his own empire.<br /><br />Ironically, Macini's warning against consumerism has become a consumer's dream.<br /><br />So what can you take from mens Halloween costumes built around Chucky? For one, you won't have to worry about being recognized. Chucky is one of the most iconic figures of his time, still famous after twenty years and a half-dozen sequels. You'll also be drawing on nostalgia - everyone has childhood memories (and nightmares) of Chucky.<br /><br />Most importantly, Chucky is scary. He's a twisted horror of what should be untouchable - a corruption of youth and innocence that goes beyond Hollywood movie magic. By choosing to have one of your Halloween outfits as Chucky, yo will be striking at deeper fear than just ghosts and spooky masks.<br /><br />Chucky also makes a great choice for mens Halloween costumes. well... child's play.<br /><br />Finding your Halloween costume doesn't have to be a frustrating event. If you're bored of the traditional costumes found at the local retail outlets, you can find some good costumes on-line. A nerd Halloween costume is one that never fails to be a success. It is a unisex costume that has the advantage of not requiring make up, masks or cumbersome parts. You can wear comfortable clothing, and it doesn't take much work to assemble the costume. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/kpMoorefielhcdClaudi/blog/blogid=4532757" target="_blank">http://en.pan.netcom/kpMoorefielhcdClaudi/blog/...</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5Post%253a4f597f40-df9e-47e1-b98f-b2aed4ce3f02%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a2e6e14e3beac498eae6f1ca99c6d51a5Post%3a4f597f40-df9e-47e1-b98f-b2aed4ce3f02&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

The special effects are spectacular and all the usual characters are reprised so that fans aren't disappointed.<br /><br />However, before the smash hit movies, the Transformers started out as a kids cartoon. They are a form of Anime or Japanese cartoons and started life as a Japanese cartoon series. When the series was brought over to the US it proved to be a quirky but popular show for kids and adults alike.<br /><br />Before you knew it, more cartoons were being made and all sorts of other merchandising could be purchased.  Principally, this meant toys, after all they were a kids show.<br /><br />As the name suggests, Transformers are disguised as ordinary objects when everything is normal - they could be a car or a truck or some other vehicle. But when they sense danger is a foot, they transform into these towering robots that have great abilities.<br /><br />Some Great Transformers Outfits To Wear This Halloween Season<br /><br />Most of the Halloween costumes out this year are based on the third movie - &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot;.<br /><br />You can get various versions of the main Autobots and even the dastardly Decepticon Megatron.<br /><br />There is the popular Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. There are outfits for all level of fan from the simple T-shirt costume to the fully 3D costume. The 3D costume looks like a suit of armor and is truly impressive. There are also versions for women and toddlers.<br /><br />Before you know it, Halloween will be on us and everyone will be on the hunt for that perfect outfit for the party or other festivities. Or maybe you have to get the kids a few outfits and you want them to look the part as they go trick or treating. You don't want you or your family to look like everybody else, therefore check out these excellent costume suggestions for Halloween 2011. These are some of the newest outfits to come out so that you will be certain to have that original look. Before we get underway, I should add that all the outfits follow a bit of a theme, notably the Ancient Egyptian and Pharaoh costume motif. So let's go.<br /><br />A bit of detail on the Ancient Egyptian theme<br /><br />Ancient Egypt was one of the first major ancient civilizations, especially in the middle east and occidental parts of the world. And it's sense of style and culture has stayed with us even in contemporary times. Perhaps it is their monuments to eternity - the Pyramids - that most fascinate us. They are a constant and rather large reminder of the ancient civilization and this rightly fascinates people.<br /><br />We are intrigued by how the people lived and what they looked like. We are even intrigued by what they looked like when they were dead. The civilization has inspired lurid horror tales about all powerful mummies terrorizing people and also soaring love stories like Antony and Cleopatra (which may even have been true!)<br /><br />And these tales from the ancient times have inspired great costume ideas. The first to consider is the mummy costume. This really stands out and makes a great impression at a party as it's pretty original.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloween34costu.jaiku.com%2Fpresence%2F4e0a01b631ff4c13b3bde8a35da9d0c0"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloween34costu.jaiku.com/presence/4e0a01b631ff4c13b3bde8a35da9d0c0</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FHalloween--The-History-of-Halloween%2F03EFBFFFF0241E4AB00080157B29B%3Fref_title%3Dhalloween99costu%26amp%3Bref_url%3Dhttp%253a%252f%252fcommunity.atom.com%252fprofile%252f0ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB%252fContent%252fPost%252fMyPosts2.aspx%26amp%3Bref_ucid%3DABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Halloween--The-History-of-Halloween/03EFBFFFF0241E4AB00080157B29B?ref_title=halloween99costu&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.atom.com%2fprofile%2f0ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB%2fContent%2fPost%2fMyPosts2.aspx&amp;ref_ucid=ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ziki.com%2Fen%2Ftheodore-coleman-1%2B228256%2Fpost%2FHalloween%3A-History-And-Origin%2B12779770"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziki.com/en/theodore-coleman-1+228256/post/Halloween:-History-And-Origin+12779770</a>

		<document id="8683d1c519fcc07712529ddd9cefdb70" url=""><![CDATA[Cool Halloween Costume Ideas For Married Couples<br/><br/>In the early 1950s, Bing Crosby, the Mills Brothers, and Frank Sinatra were all still popular.<br /><br />Married couples have two choices when dressing up for costume parties: they can each dress to their choices, or they can dress as a couple. Most couples don't decide to dress in complimenting outfits. It's probably because there are only so many fork and spoon, or plug and socket costumes one can see before the idea is old. So, consider these three usual couples costume choices, and see if they can encourage you to think outside the box for your next party.<br /><br />Chess King and Queen. This costume can be easily done with a pair of black or white robes, and matching black or white masks. To differentiate between you, you'll want king and queen hats. There are 2 ways to make your own easily: First, buy 2 headbands and a chess set. Glue the king to the center of one, choosing the color of the robes you have. Then, use the pawns (or other chess pieces) to fill out the headband.<br /><br />The other option for a hat would be to make the crowns for the king and queen. If you can find existing crowns that would work, great, otherwise you might want to use cardboard, and trace and cut out the shape, and paint it the appropriate colour. For an added touch, paint your masks in a black and white chessboard pattern.<br /><br />Cheating wife and husband. If you want to confuse people, consider dressing up as the cheating wife and husband. For the husband, wear pants that are rumpled, a belt that's twisted, untied shoes, and a button down shirt. Make sure the shirt's not buttoned correctly, and place lipstick marks on the collar. For the wife, tuck a skirt into pantyhose, mess up your hair, smudge your lipstick, and mismatch the buttons on y our shirt. For added fun, wear a lacy bra on the outside of your shirt.<br /><br />This costume might not go over well with some people. If you're attending a party where you know someone may have been on the other end of a cheating spouse, you may want to exercise discretion and avoid bringing up bad memories with this outfit.<br /><br />Trophy Wife with Husband. For the husband, this outfit is easy. Wear either a nice suit, or a polo shirt, khakis, and a sweater tied over the shoulders. Bonus points for a fake tan and sparkling white teeth. For the wife, style your hair elaborately, or purchase a wig (blonde is popular). Slather on the makeup, and dress in something low cut. If you're not large chested, stuff a bra to enormous proportions and wear it under the shirt. Find a ring with a huge fake diamond on it, and a small trophy. Put the trophy on a ribbon or chain about your neck, and smile widely at everyone as you hang off your husband's arm, flashing your ring.<br /><br />He may not be the biggest, bloodiest, or most intimidating horror movie villain, but Chucky the doll has still traumatized millions of movie-goers with just a few words.<br /><br />&quot;Hi, I'm Chucky. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloweencostumesfor201167.wikispaces.com%2F5%2BExcellent%2BHalloween%2BCostume%2BIdeas%2BFor%2BKids%2BIn%2B2011"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloweencostumesfor201167.wikispaces.com/5+Excellent+Halloween+Costume+Ideas+For+Kids+In+2011</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloween34costu.jaiku.com%2Fpresence%2F4e0a01b631ff4c13b3bde8a35da9d0c0"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloween34costu.jaiku.com/presence/4e0a01b631ff4c13b3bde8a35da9d0c0</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FHalloween--The-History-of-Halloween%2F03EFBFFFF0241E4AB00080157B29B%3Fref_title%3Dhalloween99costu%26amp%3Bref_url%3Dhttp%253a%252f%252fcommunity.atom.com%252fprofile%252f0ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB%252fContent%252fPost%252fMyPosts2.aspx%26amp%3Bref_ucid%3DABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Halloween--The-History-of-Halloween/03EFBFFFF0241E4AB00080157B29B?ref_title=halloween99costu&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.atom.com%2fprofile%2f0ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB%2fContent%2fPost%2fMyPosts2.aspx&amp;ref_ucid=ABE441020241E4AB00010241E4AB</a>

When it comes to deciding on your Halloween costumes for 2011, don't forget about fit.  If you come up with the best, most original or entertaining idea, but it's not avaialable in your size, forget about it and move on.  I've heard too many horror stories about kids who trip over their costumes all night long, or grown-ups who buy something so tight, they can't eat at the Halloween party they're attending.  Don't be one of the many who report a nightmare story like this and make sure you order a size that actually fits.  Believe me, the trade off between a Halloween costume that fits correctly and one that's just a great idea, but in totally the wrong size, always err toward the correct size.<br />   Determine if you'll be inside or outside.  Again.  Another basic one.  But the type of Halloween costume you purchase for your child to go trick or treating on a cool, dark October evening is very different from the costume a grown-up might wear to an indoor party. You will be the hit of the party when they see how great you look and how fabulously you fight crime in any number of green lantern costumes. These new for Costumes are a great addition to your next costumed event. With all the fun and excitement that is in this movie your friends will expect you to bring home and you will be able to and then some with a Green Lantern Costume. Just think how great you will look and the mayhem you can keep at bay when you transform into a superhero for the night.<br /><br />Maybe the Green Lantern isn't for you but you are still looking for a super hero costume for your big event. Why not look to 2011 Captain America Halloween Costumes for the perfect costume piece. Fight for the American way all night long with one of these fabulous new Captain America Costumes. Just think of the compliments you will receive and how great it will feel to show your patriotism and your true devotion to the USA. Captain America lends himself nicely to costumes because of his color and spunk. Don't let anyone threaten your homeland with Halloween; step out and save the country with any number of fun costumes from the Captain America movie.<br /><br />Though superheroes have a lot of fun they don't have all the fun and another rowdy movie that inspires costumes is Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirate Costumes are always a great choice for your Halloween attire but what is even better is true Pirates of the Caribbean Costume. These costumes will have you swashbuckling and treasure hunting all night long. Step on the wrong side of the law for a night that you won't soon forget. Enter the party as Captain Jack himself or one of his crazy crew. These movies are so much fun they can't just be contained to the big screen. This really stands out and makes a great impression at a party as it's pretty original.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloweencustomesfor201135.wetpaint.com%2Fpage%2FHalloween%253A%2BHistory%2BAnd%2BOrigin%2B%252888%2529"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloweencustomesfor201135.wetpaint.com/page/Halloween%3A+History+And+Origin+%2888%29</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fquizilla.teennick.com%2Fstories%2F20624577%2Fcool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-looking-sexy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/20624577/cool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-looking-sexy</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloween-customes-for-201135.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F9239785373%2Fcool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-people-who-are-not"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloween-customes-for-201135.tumblr.com/post/9239785373/cool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-people-who-are-not</a>

		<document id="7f5e2f19a140ce0fef922bc37e7980b3" url=""><![CDATA[Cool Halloween Costume Ideas For Looking Sexy<br/><br/>She's known for a short haircut, almost boyishly short and combed to one side, and lots of eyelashes. So, once you've taken a look at her photos, hit up your local second hand store, and comb through their vintage fashions until you find something you like. Pair it with go go boots, or heels, fake lashes, and style your hair, or wear a short wig. Now you have a costume that won't be like everyone else's.<br /><br />For skinny men, you could always go as Luigi, the often forgotten half of the Mario brothers. Hit up your local second hand store and pick up a green turtleneck, overalls, white gloves, and a green trucker hat or baseball cap. Paint a white circle on your hat, with a green L in the center. Also, pick up a fake mustache, either in the Halloween section of a store, or go to the kid's section and see if they have a fake one. The bushier and more outrageous, the better.<br /><br />Another option, although not completely for skinny guys, is to go as a Twister game. Go buy a copy of Twister, and staple some ribbon or twine to the edges of the spinner board, so you can tie it on your head like a hat. Cut a hole in the game board so it will slip over your head like a poncho. Wear your normal clothes under the ensemble, or dress in all black. You can get a rise out of people if you're at a party by suggesting the put right hand blue, or other twister positions, to see what they will do.<br /><br />Hip Costumes. Everyone wants their costume to be cool, but hip is more than cool. That fabulous super hero costume you spent months putting together doesn't mean much if you're one of ten people with the same costume idea. To be hip, you need to think outside the box. And we're here to help. Here are four tips to help make your costume more than cool.<br /><br />1. Think outside the box. Super heroes, vampires, and pirates are all common costumes. Common isn't hip, so consider something unusual. When in doubt, visit your favorite online costume site, and browse their costumes. Often, you can find a costume, or partial costume, that you could turn into something unusual. Also consider a second hand store, as there are many great vintage clothing options that could be turned into costumes.<br /><br />2. Less is more. You don't need an elaborate costume, full face makeup, and a wig to be totally decked out for Halloween. Sometimes, a few props are all you need to give the impression of what you're trying to be. If you're going as a silent movie star, for example, you might carry a cigarette in a holder, or wear a faux fur wrap. You don't need both items, and a purse, and several other things.<br /><br />3. Make your own costume. Store bought costumes are nice enough, but a really cool, hip costume is handmade. If you can't sew, consider simple, no sew options, or try and commission someone to help you out. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloween-customes-for-201135.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F9239785373%2Fcool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-people-who-are-not"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloween-customes-for-201135.tumblr.com/post/9239785373/cool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-people-who-are-not</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fquizilla.teennick.com%2Fstories%2F20624577%2Fcool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-looking-sexy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/20624577/cool-halloween-costume-ideas-for-looking-sexy</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloweencustomesfor201135.wetpaint.com%2Fpage%2FHalloween%253A%2BHistory%2BAnd%2BOrigin%2B%252888%2529"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloweencustomesfor201135.wetpaint.com/page/Halloween%3A+History+And+Origin+%2888%29</a>

Those sorts of costumes can often be made without a lot of work or money, and they're great for busy people, or those who don't consider themselves all that crafty.<br /><br />5. She was invited to speak to a class at Columbia on terrorism and anti-terrorism. Kate Beckinsdale wrote award winning poetry and short stories, she won two awards. Nicolas Cage, and Barrack Obama are admitted comic book nerds. With all the famous nerds out there, you'll be in good company if you choose this for your Halloween costume.<br /><br />When it comes down to selecting your nerd Halloween costume, if you want to avoid the hassle of creating your own costume, you can easily find what you're looking for online. You can select a simple costume like Harry Potter, Where's Waldo or Ugly Betty, or opt for a generic one and add your own flair to the nerd costume. Whatever you choose, it is sure to be a hit because Halloween is the time where everyone loves a nerd.<br /><br />So, you want a killer costume for Halloween or another event, but you're not very crafty? Trying for something people will talk about, but don't have a very big budget, or a lot of time? I can relate. Some of my favorite costumes were cobbled together using what I had at home, or a quick trip to a second hand store for a few items.<br /><br />So, to help you out, since I'm so nice, I've cobbled together five quick and easy costumes that even those who aren't very crafty can make. They don't cost much, and they can be put together pretty quickly.<br /><br />1. Doctor or Surgeon. Hit up the second hand store and look for either a set scrubs, or a white lab coat. If you manage a white lab coat, check around and see if you can find a real or toy stethoscope at the second hand store. If not, hit up your local big box and look for one in the toy section. If you managed to score scrubs, head to your local big box store, and pick up a disposable paper mask, and some rubber gloves. Now you have a quick costume that's not uncomfortable.<br /><br />2. Flasher: Visit the second hand store and pick up an inexpensive overcoat, something that falls to your knees or lower. Then, depending on how detailed you want to get, you can either wear underwear only, and flash people, or wear shorts and a t shirt underneath. Bonus option: find a flesh coloured leotard (second hand stores usually have them) and find a speedo or some other form of underwear. It'll give your friends a real shock when you flash them.<br /><br />3. Cereal Killer. Either buy a pack of those little cereal boxes, or grab a couple big boxes from home. Find some plastic knives, and stick at least one knife into each cereal box. Use some red paint, and paint drips down the boxes and is on the knives. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gather.com%2FviewArticle.action%3FarticleId%3D281474980022567"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474980022567</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhalloween31cost.livejournal.com%2F3086.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://halloween31cost.livejournal.com/3086.html</a>,

Whatever you choose, it is sure to be a hit because Halloween is the time where everyone loves a nerd.<br /><br />So, you want a killer costume for Halloween or another event, but you're not very crafty? Trying for something people will talk about, but don't have a very big budget, or a lot of time? I can relate. Some of my favorite costumes were cobbled together using what I had at home, or a quick trip to a second hand store for a few items.<br /><br />So, to help you out, since I'm so nice, I've cobbled together five quick and easy costumes that even those who aren't very crafty can make. They don't cost much, and they can be put together pretty quickly.<br /><br />1. Doctor or Surgeon. Hit up the second hand store and look for either a set scrubs, or a white lab coat. If you manage a white lab coat, check around and see if you can find a real or toy stethoscope at the second hand store. If not, hit up your local big box and look for one in the toy section. If you managed to score scrubs, head to your local big box store, and pick up a disposable paper mask, and some rubber gloves. Now you have a quick costume that's not uncomfortable.<br /><br />2. Flasher: Visit the second hand store and pick up an inexpensive overcoat, something that falls to your knees or lower. Then, depending on how detailed you want to get, you can either wear underwear only, and flash people, or wear shorts and a t shirt underneath. Bonus option: find a flesh coloured leotard (second hand stores usually have them) and find a speedo or some other form of underwear. It'll give your friends a real shock when you flash them.<br /><br />3. Cereal Killer. Either buy a pack of those little cereal boxes, or grab a couple big boxes from home. Find some plastic knives, and stick at least one knife into each cereal box. Use some red paint, and paint drips down the boxes and is on the knives. Attach them to your clothes, big safety pins will work. Consider taking the bags of cereal out of the boxes before attaching, they can weigh your costume down.<br /><br />4. Mario. Why not choose Mario from Super Mario Brothers? Buy overalls, a red turtleneck, white gloves, and a red baseball cap or trucker hat at a second hand store. Paint a white circle with a red M on the hat. With such high expectations, the new film must work hard to find approval.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Fhalloween16costu%2Fmens-halloween-costumes-and-chucky-1"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/halloween16costu/mens-halloween-costumes-and-chucky-1</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fhalloween66costu%2Fwhat-is-halloween"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/halloween66costu/what-is-halloween</a>
