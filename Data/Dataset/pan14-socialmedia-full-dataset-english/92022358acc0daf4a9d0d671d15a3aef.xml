<br /><br />Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me !
<br /><br />Only the wisest and the stupidest of men never change.
<br /><br />Don’t let your victories go to your head, or your failures go to your heart.
<br /><br />Those who criticize our generation forget who raised it.
<br /><br />Criticizing is easy, art is difficult.
<br /><br />Violence won’t solve a thing. It makes it more challenging to solve, though.
<br /><br />I don’t know what the key to success is, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone.
<br /><br />When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends.
<br /><br />Not to care for philosophy is to be a true philosopher.
<br /><br />The mind is like a parachute. It doesn’t work unless it’s open.
<br /><br />The best mind-altering drug is truth.
<br /><br />Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.
<br /><br />Never forget what a man says to you when he is angry.
<br /><br />A winner listens, a loser just waits until it is their turn to talk.
<br /><br />Guns don’t kill people — people do.
<br /><br />He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself is enlightened.
<br /><br />If you are not part of the cure, then you are part of the problem.
<br /><br />The only time you run out of chances is when you stop taking them.
<br /><br />The best things in life are not things.
<br /><br />An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
<br /><br />You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him.
<br /><br />Think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought.

<br /><br />Dear Lord, I thank you for this day. I thank You for me being able to see and to hear this morning. I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me. Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness.
<br /><br />Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You.
<br /><br />Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things.
<br /><br />Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over. Let me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.
<br /><br />And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example -- to slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. Continue to use me to do Your will.

<br />And the LORD God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.' Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said: 'This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.' Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.&quot;

Many people think that to get what you want you have to take it. There is a universal truth though that the true path to get what you want is to give. When you give, you get. What you sow, you shall reap. If this is true, then what is it we must give? I'll show you the way…
<br /><br />Give Others Your Honesty. The world we live in has a simple rule that most follow: Lie when you have to. Unfortunately, this may make some people wealthy but it make us humans poor. To achieve success is to become wealthy not only in money, but in character. To be successful, truly successful, is to be able to attain your goals and keep your character at the same time!…
<br /><br />How about you? Are you honest in all things? The problem with little lies is they become big ones. Lies spin out of control. You get caught in one lie and you lie to get out of it etc. In all things and at all times, give others your honesty.
<br /><br />Give Others Your Respect. Most of the time we give people respect based on what they have done or what they have accomplished. We gauge whether or not they are &quot;worthy&quot; of it based on what we know of what they have achieved or who they know or are related to.
<br /><br />But I believe we should have a higher standard: We respect people not for what they have done or for who they are related to or for what they can do for us. Instead, we respect people for simply being.…
<br /><br />Give Others Your Vulnerability. We are taught to &quot;be strong.&quot; And yes, we should be strong. But we have also embraced something that I think keeps us from having the kind of life that we long for. It is an idea that keeps us from experiencing the kind of relationships that would bring deep meaning to us. It is the idea of vulnerability.…
<br /><br />&quot;But Chris, make yourself vulnerable and people will step all over you!&quot; It is true that this will happen. But I have also seen that most people will be drawn to you. They will help you. They will open up to you. You see, we are all broken people inside. We all have secrets. Yet everyone plays the poser. When one let's down their veil, others soon follow—and we all win.
<br /><br />Give Others Your Care. Too many people are running around this old earth not caring about others. The days of &quot;Look Out for Number One&quot; and &quot;Winning Through Intimidation&quot; are over! Let's bring about a new day when we can care about others and succeed!
<br /><br />Take the time to show people you care. Listen to them. Empathize with them. Love them. Now, I don't mean that you have to go around hugging everyone—that probably wouldn't fly in corporate America anyway—but we can take some time to step back from business and be human! And I have found that when we do so, our business succeeds as well!
<br /><br />Give Others Your Passion. There is nothing this world needs more than passionate people. And people need passionate people. Living in this day and age can be tiring. The hustle and bustle of it all can wear you down and tire you out. Give your passion to others and fire them up.
<br /><br />Don't just be humdrum—be excited. Give people all the energy you can muster up. And you will find that energy reciprocal. They will get energized and passionate. This in turn will fire you up more when you are already charged and get you going altogether when you don't feel like moving at all!
<br /><br />Give Others Your Experience. We all have areas that we excel in and they are usually areas that we have experience in. One of the things we can do to make our lives more meaningful and be of utmost help to others is to show them the way through the experiences we have.
<br /><br />Sometimes it will be what they should do: Shortcuts to take, people to meet etc. Sometimes it will be what they should not do: Shortcuts not to take and people to stay away from! Whatever it is, we can be of service to others by giving them our experience and ultimately it will make us all better!
<br /><br />Give Others Your Help. All in all, what we want to do is to help others. Zig Ziglar says that if we will &quot;help others get what they want, we will in turn get what we want.&quot; If we want to be successful, we should consider ourselves servants of other people. What can we do to help them and make them better? This is the true path to greatness and success, not only in business but in life!

<br /><br />I am in every place but many search for me as if I am located only in certain places, nations and societies and not in others. While people leave the North in search of me in the South, others leave the South in search of me in the North.
<br /><br />I have riches and wealth but I never appear in any of these forms; I appear at times as crisis, problems, misfortunes and challenges and so, even those searching for me, see me and run away because of my appearance. This is my strategy throughout history and con temporal times.
<br /><br />It takes the eyes of the heart to recognize me when I come. I will never appear the way I am expected; I continue to exist in ways and forms which demands for greater perspective and perception to identify me.
<br /><br />I also bring relationships in the life of people to alter their circumstances in the present and the future but most at times; such relationships are taken for granted and replaced with those having nothing to offer.
<br /><br />Those who are nothing today can be something tomorrow if they can identify me in their crisis, challenges and relationships and take full advantage of me.
<br /><br />I opportunity live in places, people, situations and circumstances; my mission is to change and empower those who identify me and make full use of me.
<br /><br />Look at where you are now, the circumstances and people that surround you; can you identify me? The ability to identify me is the greatest prove of sight. I will leave you for now!!! See you when you see me!!!!!!

How many times do we find ourselves living below the standard that God paid the price for us to enjoy? God paid the ultimate price through the giving of His only Son that we might enjoy being in right relationship with Him. HE makes us righteous and worthy to enjoy the good life.
<br /><br />There will be many opportunities everyday to think negative thoughts. Your mind is a real battlefield that influences the belief system in your heart. You are responsible on a daily basis to feed your mind good positive food. Do not feed your mind with nonproductive useless information. When negative thoughts come to you, trying to convince you that you're not a WINNER, you must immediately get rid of those thoughts by replacing them with positive, Word-based thoughts. Tell yourself over and over that you can do all things through Christ who is your strength. Feed your soul truth that says, &quot;you are more than a conqueror.&quot;

<br />You have been in my prayers for the last three months. I feel that some of us have been in very unusual challenges, but God has been speaking to me with this word, that our challenge has become so hard because we are in the labor room of expectation, being expectant with an usual miracle that is about to spring forth.
<br />Something you have prayed for so long will break forth for you.
<br />For some the challenges seem unbearable because we have been moved from the labor ward in to the delivery room. And in the next few days we will give birth to a miracle that will bring back all the years the canker warm has eaten. Joel 1
<br />I feel that some of you have already given birth to answered prayers.
<br />Either way it is time to put prayer and Faith on to over drive.

<br />When you are in conflict, concentrate on reconciliation rather than resolution. There’s a big difference: Reconciliation means to re-establish the relationship, but resolution means to resolve every issue by coming to agreement on everything.
<br />That's simply not going to happen. I don't care if you both love the Lord or are deeply in love with each other; there are some things you'll never agree on, because God has wired each of us differently.
<br />But you can disagree without being disagreeable — that's called wisdom. The Bible says in James 3, “Wisdom is peace loving and courteous. It allows discussion, and it is willing to yield to others.”
<br />The Bible says it's wise to compromise. You can have unity without uniformity. You can walk hand-in-hand without seeing eye-to-eye. You can have reconciliation without resolution of every issue.
<br />When we focus on the relationship, the issues often become insignificant. This is my challenge to you: In a world filled with conflict, war, prejudice, violence, partisanship, and broken relationships, commit to becoming an agent of reconciliation.
<br />It is no accident that the first letter of P.E.A.C.E represents God’s goal for us to be peacemakers. It’s always more rewarding to resolve the conflict than to dissolve the relationship.
<br />Talk About It
<br />In what relationships or situations in your life can you be an agent of reconciliation?
<br />Have you made a habit of “burning bridges” as you tried to move on from a conflict?
<br />How does your attitude need to change so that you can bring reconciliation to your relationships?

For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

<br /><br />Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.

<br /><br />But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.

For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. ...

He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him:
