<br />You know that I will miss you now you're gone
<br />I know it's not your life to see this through
<br />Just know that in my heart, it beats for you
<br />So leave a little note for me behind
<br />I swear I have to know the reasons why
<br />This won't survive
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside
<br />Telling me to be your only one
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by
<br />I could never leave this world undone
<br />I want to be your only one
<br /><br />And now it's not the same with you away
<br />Just holding onto hope to save my days
<br />I won't survive
<br />So just stay with me tonight, and try
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside
<br />Telling me to be your only one
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by
<br />I could never leave this war unsung
<br />I want to be your only one
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside
<br />Telling me to be your only one
<br /><br />But if you fall back into my life
<br />I promise you I would never let another day just pass us by
<br />I could never leave this world undone
<br />I could never leave this war unsung

<br />Staying up all night
<br /><br />There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street

<br />When I told you that this was goodbye
<br />You were begging me not tonight
<br />Not here, not now
<br />We're looking up at the same night sky
<br />And keep pretending the sun will not rise 
<br />Be together for one more night
<br />Somewhere, somehow

<br /><br />Any guy can call you sexy, hot, and all that.. it takes a real man to call you beautiful.
<br /><br />Any guy can call you in tears begging you to take him back, it takes a real man to not have a reason to be in those tears.
<br /><br />Any guy can say I love you, it takes a real man to say it and mean it even if all of his guy friends are standing around.
<br /><br />Any guy can drive over to your house to hang out with you, it takes a real man to
<br />show up unexpected.
<br /><br />Any guy can throw back a beer or two, it takes a real man to grab a coke instead knowing he shouldn't do it if you're not around.
<br /><br />Any guy can have sex with a girl, it takes a real man to wait.
<br /><br />Any guy can be with you on the best days when everything is ok, it takes a real man to stay by your side for weeks if thats what it takes when it feels like your world is falling apart.
<br /><br />Any guy can talk noise with his friends when a sexy girl walks by, it takes a real man to look the other way.
<br /><br />Any guy can be sweet and true to your face, it takes a real man to stay sweet and true when you're gone.
<br /><br />Any guy can give you a hug, it takes a real man to just hold you.
<br /><br />Any guy can mess around with a girl when she's laying beside him, it takes a real man to just lay there.
<br /><br />****Any guy can answer the phone when he knows you're having a bad day, it takes a real man to call you throughout the day just to make sure you're ok.
<br /><br />****Any guy can hit reply to a text msg, it takes a real guy to be the person who sends a msg first.
<br /><br />Any guy can read this message and swear to themselves that this is them, it takes a real man to actually do these things.
<br /><br />****SOOO TRUEE!!
<br /><br />---Ladies!- Repost this as IT TAKES A REAL MAN.. if you know what it takes for a guy to be a real man.
<br /><br />--Men!- Repost this as IM GOING TO BE THIS MAN..if you're willing to

<br />Show soul
<br />Kiss the stars with me

<br />We say to those who are in love
<br />It can't be true 'cause we're too young
<br />I know that's true because
<br />so long I was
<br />So in love with you
<br />So I thought
<br /><br />A year goes by
<br />And I can't talk about it
<br /><br />On my knees
<br />Dim lighted room
<br />Thoughts free flow try to consume
<br />Myself in this
<br />I'm not faithless
<br />Just paranoid of getting lost or that I might lose
<br />Ignorance is bliss cherish it
<br />Pretty neighborhoods
<br />You learn to much to hold
<br />Believe it not
<br />And fight the tears
<br />With pretty smiles and lies
<br />About the times
<br /><br />A year goes by
<br />And I can't talk about it
<br /><br />The times weren't right
<br />And I couldn't talk about it

<br />Close your eyes and I'll close mine
<br />Remember you, remember me
<br />Hurt the first, the last, between

<br />Close your eyes and I'll close mine
<br />Remember you, remember me
<br />Hurt the first, the last, between
<br /><br />And I'm praying that we will see
<br />Something there in between
<br />Then and there that exceeds all we can dream
<br />So we can talk about it

<br />in a field behind your yard,
<br />you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
<br />And sometimes we don't say a thing;
<br />just listen to the crickets sing.
<br />Everything I need is right here by my side.
<br />And I know everything about you
<br />I don't wanna live without you.
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />I'm only up when your'e not down.
<br />Don't wanna fly if your'e still on the ground.
<br />It's like no matter what I do.
<br />Well you drive me crazy half the time;
<br />the other half im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
<br />And I'm only me when I'm with you.
<br /><br />Just a small town boy and girl
<br />livin' in a crazy world.
<br />Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
<br />And I don't try to hide my tears.
<br />The secrets are my deepest fears.
<br />Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
<br />And you know everything about me.
<br />You say you can't live without me.

<br />the other half im only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
<br />And I'm only me when I'm with you.
<br /><br />When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
<br />Only you can tell.
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />That I'm only up when your'e not down.
<br />Don't wanna fly if your'e still on the ground.
