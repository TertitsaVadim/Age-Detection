All of a sudden he said out loud, &quot;Lord, grant me one wish&quot; The sky clouded above his head and in a booming voice, the Lord said, &quot;Because you have tried to be faithful to me in all ways, I will grant you one wish.&quot;
<br /><br />The man said, &quot;Build a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over anytime I want&quot;.
<br /><br />The Lord said, &quot;Your request is very materialistic. Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific! The concrete and steel it would take! I can do it, but it is hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things. Take a little more time and think of another wish, a wish you think would honor and glorify me&quot;.
<br /><br />The man thought about it for a long time. Finally he said, &quot;Lord, I wish that I could understand women. I want to know how they feel inside, what they're thinking when they give the silent treatment, why they cry, what they mean when they say 'nothing', and how I can make a woman truly happy&quot;.
<br /><br />The Lord replied, &quot;YOU WANT TWO LANES OR FOUR LANES ON THAT BRIDGE

<br /><br />What Makes 100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over 100%. How about achieving 103%? What makes up 100% in life?
<br /><br />Here’s a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:
<br /><br />If:
<br />A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
<br /><br />Is Represented As:
<br /><br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26.
<br /><br />Then:
<br /><br />H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K
<br />8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=
<br />98%
<br /><br />And
<br /><br />K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E
<br />11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5=
<br />96%
<br /><br />But
<br /><br />A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
<br />1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5=
<br />100%
<br /><br />And,
<br /><br />B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T
<br />2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20=
<br />103%
<br /><br />A! ND, look how far ass kissing will take you.
<br /><br />A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G
<br />1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7=

<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />LET US PAY FOR YOU!
<br /><br />DON'T &quot;FEEL BAD&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no
<br /><br />one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for WHO you are and not WHAT you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hott Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Jesse McCartney is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: IF YOU AREN'T BEING TREATED RIGHT BY A GUY, DON'T WAIT FOR HIM TO CHANGE. DITCH HIS SORRY, DISGRACE-TO-THE-MALE-POPULATION ASS, AND FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TREAT YOU WITH UTTER
<br />RESPECT
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your
<br />lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..
<br /><br />........AND ACTUALLY MEAN IT!

<br />The Secret behind the number 11 - Pretty Chilling 
<br />Read to the bottom. Try it out. I did and I got goose bumps
<br />If you are a sceptical person - still read on as it's actual very interesting!!
<br />This is actually really freaky!! (Mainly the end part, but read it first)
<br />1) New York City has 11 letters
<br />2) Afghanistan has 11 letters.
<br />3) Ramsin Yuseb has 11letters.(The terrorist
<br />who threatened to destroy the Twin Towers in 1993)
<br />4) George W Bush has 11 letters. 
<br /><br />This could be a mere coincidence, but this gets interesting:
<br />1) New York is the 11th state.
<br />2) The first plane crashing against the Twin Towers was flight number 11.
<br />3) Flight 11 was carrying 92 passengers. 9 + 2 = 11
<br />4) Flight 77 which also hit Twin Towers , was carrying 65 
<br />passengers. 6+5 = 11
<br />5) The tragedy was on September 11, or 9/11 as it is now known. 9+ 1+ 1 =11
<br />6) The date is equal to the US emergency services telephone number
<br />911. 9 + 1 + 1 = 11
<br />Sheer coincidence..?! Read on and make up your own mind:
<br />1) The total number of victims inside all the hi-jacked planes was 254. 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br />2) September 11 is day number 254 of the calendar year. Again 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
<br />3) The Madrid bombing took place on 3/11/2004. 3 + 1 + 1 + 2+ 4=11.
<br />4) The tragedy of Madrid happened 911 days after the Twin Towers incident.
<br />Now this is where things get totally eerie: 
<br /><br />The most recognized symbol for the US , after the Stars &amp;
<br />Stripes,is the Eagle. The following verse is taken from the Koran,the Islamic holy book:
<br />&quot;For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a
<br />fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced: for the wrath of the
<br />Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah and there was peace.&quot; 
<br />That verse is number 9.11 of the Koran. Unconvinced about all of this Still ..?! 
<br />Try this and see how you feel afterwards, it made my hair
<br />stand on end: 
<br />Open Microsoft Word and do the following:
<br />1. Type in capitals Q33 NY. This is the flight number of the first plane to hit one of the Twin Towers .
<br />2. Highlight the Q33 NY.
<br />3. Change the font size to 48.
<br />4. Change the actual font to the WINGDINGS 1
<br /><br />What do you think now?!!

Perhaps love is just an illusion. A strong illusion, especially for those who are searching for a purpose of life. Is love an answer? Love can be wonderful, special, complicated, a distress, a gift, a curse, a tragedy, and most of all, an experience. ??Love is a mysterious and a complicated force. What do a person mean when they say they love someone? Love is many different things. Each of us have our own understanding of Love is, and most of the time we base our definitions from feelings and experiences. The book defines love in many ways. &quot;It is a strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties.&quot; It can be an affection and tenderness felt by lovers. Love is the object of attachment, devotion, or admiration. 
<br /><br />??Just when we thought we finally grasp what love is, somebody asks: 
<br /><br />??&quot;Does anyone really know what &quot;LOVE&quot; mean? I believe I have a true love, but &quot;True love&quot; is always hurt, isn&quot;t it?&quot; 
<br /><br />??I scratches my head with this thought and began to wonder. What is the answer to this? &quot;This I have to know!&quot; I said to myself. I looked in the mirror and asked &quot;Is it a true love when you know you want to live with this special ??person for the rest of your life? Have we reached &quot;true love&quot; when we are ready to give everything away towards our subject? Or maybe when can go as far as to sacrifice ourselves for our love? What about love as an obsession? Is that possible? 
<br /><br />??&quot;But isn&quot;t love suppose to be an obsession? If it is not, then you&quot;d have to rationalize. If you rationalize then it&quot;s not love, because there is always a better rationalization.&quot; 
<br /><br />??&quot;I think the &quot;in love&quot; phase is obsessive but according to Williamson (and backed up by my paltry experience), love does not involve the ego, is selfless and the opposite of obsession.&quot; 
<br /><br />??According to Marriane Williamson, the author of &quot;A Return to Love,&quot; there is a &quot;holy love&quot; and a &quot;special love.&quot; &quot;The latter type is the obsessiveone; finding that one &quot;special&quot; person absorbs _ALL_ your attention.&quot; 
<br /><br />??So who is right and who is wrong about love? There is no wrong answer. Love is many wonderful things. Love may not work out all the time but it leaves you a special sort of feeling, like nothing you have ever imagined. Is love a purpose of life? I think are life will be dull without it. But is it necessary? Important? It is a part of life, and forever it will be a part of us. 
<br /><br />??&quot;Love is not thinking about your happiness but making others happy&quot; -anonymous 
<br /><br />??&quot;Our hearts are created to Love.&quot; -E. Atienza 
<br /><br />??&quot;Love is like a roller coaster, it has ups and downs.&quot; 
<br /><br />??&quot;Love doesn&quot;t make the world go around, Love makes the ride worth while.&quot; -unknown 
<br /><br />??&quot;Money will buy you sex but not Love.&quot; -Simon Vainrub 
<br /><br />??&quot;The more you cry for the person you really love, the more you can understand real love.&quot; -Tsuchida Tomomi

<br /><br />1. I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you.. 
<br /><br />2. No man or woma! n is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry. 
<br /><br />3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. 
<br /><br />4.. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart. 
<br /><br />5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them. 
<br /><br />6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. 
<br /><br />7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world. 
<br /><br />8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you. 
<br /><br />9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person , we will know how to be grateful. 
<br /><br />10. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened. 
<br /><br />11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around. 
<br /><br />12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.! 
<br /><br />13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to. 
<br /><br />REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON. 
<br /><br />True friends: How many people actually have 8 true friends? 
<br /><br />Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right friends and good friends!!!

<br />2.	I don’t know what your problem is, but I’ll bet it’s hard to pronounce.
<br />3.	How about never? Is never good for you?
<br />4.	I see you’ve set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.
<br />5.	I’m really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way.
<br />6.	I’ll try being nicer if you’ll try being smarter.
<br />7.	I’m out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.
<br />8.	I don’t work here. I’m a consultant.
<br />9.	It sounds like English, but I can’t understand a damn word you’re saying.
<br />10.	Ahhh…I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again…
<br />11.	I like you. You remind me of myself when I was young and stupid.
<br />12.	You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.
<br />13.	I have plenty of talent and vision; I just don’t give a damn.
<br />14.	I’m already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.
<br />15.	I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.
<br />16.	Thank you. We’re all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view.
<br />17.	The fact that no one understands you doesn’t mean you’re an artist.
<br />18.	Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
<br />19.	What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
<br />20.	I’m not being rude. You’re just insignificant.
<br />21.	It’s a thankless job, but I’ve got a lot of Karma to burn off.
<br />22.	Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial
<br />23.	And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be….?
<br />24.	Do I look like a people person?
<br />25.	This isn’t an office. It’s Hell with fluorescent lighting.

<br />27.	Sarcasm is just one more service, we offer.
<br />28.	If I throw a stick. Will you leave?
<br />29.	Errors have been made. Others well be blamed.
<br />30.	Whatever kind of look you were going for you missed.
<br />31.	I’m trying to imagine you with a personality.
<br />32.	A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.
<br />33.	Can I trade this job for what’s behind door #1.
<br />34.	Too many freaks not enough circuses.
