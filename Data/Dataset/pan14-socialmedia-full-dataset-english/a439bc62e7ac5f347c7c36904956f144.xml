<br /><br />Satan called a worldwide convention of demons. 
<br /><br />In his opening address he said, 
<br /><br />&quot;We can't keep Christians from going to church.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;We can't keep them from reading their Bibles and knowing the truth.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;We can't even keep them from forming an intimate relationship with their savior.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Once they gain that connection with Jesus, our power over them is broken.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;So let them go to their churches; let them have their covered dish dinners, BUT steal their time, so they don't have time to develop a relationship with Jesus Christ..&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;This is what I want you to do,&quot; said the devil: 
<br /><br />&quot;Distract them from gaining hold of their Savior and maintaining that vital connection throughout their day!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;How shall we do this?&quot; his demons shouted. 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep them busy in the non-essentials of life and invent innumerable schemes to occupy their minds,&quot; he answered. 
<br /><br />&quot;Tempt them to spend, spend, spend, and borrow, borrow, borrow.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Persuade the wives to go to work for long hours and the husbands to work 6-7 days each week, 10-12 hours a day, so they can afford their empty lifestyles.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep them from spending time with their children.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;As their families fragment, soon, their homes will offer no escape from the pressures of work!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Over-stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still, small voice.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Entice them to play the radio or cassette player whenever they drive.&quot; To keep the TV, VCR, CDs and their PCs going constantly in their home and see to it that every store and restaurant in the world plays non-biblical music constantly.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;This will jam their minds and break that union with Christ.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Fill the coffee tables with magazines and newspapers.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Pound their minds with the news 24 hours a day.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Invade their driving moments with billboards.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Flood their mailboxes with junk mail, mail order catalogs, sweepstakes, and every kind of newsletter and promotional offering free products, services and false hopes..&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep skinny, beautiful models on the magazines and TV so their husbands will believe that outward beauty is what's important, and they'll become dissatisfied with their wives. &quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep the wives too tired to love their husbands at night.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Give them headaches too! &quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;If they don't give their husbands the love they need, they will begin to look elsewhere.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;That will fragment their families quickly!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Give them Santa Claus to distract them from teaching their children the real meaning of Christmas.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Give them an Easter bunny so they won't talk about his resurrection and power over sin and death.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Even in their recreation, let them be excessive.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Have them return from their recreation exhausted.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep them too busy to go out in nature and reflect on God's creation. Send them to amusement parks, sporting events, plays, concerts, and movies instead.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Keep them busy, busy, busy!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;And when they meet for spiritual fellowship, involve them in gossip and small talk so that they leave with troubled consciences.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Crowd their lives with so many good causes they have no time to seek power from Jesus.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Soon they will be working in their own strength, sacrificing their health and family for the good of the cause.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;It will work!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;It will work!&quot; 
<br /><br />It was quite a plan! 
<br /><br />The demons went eagerly to their assignments causing Christians everywhere to get busier and more rushed, going here and there. 
<br /><br />Having little time for their God or their families. 
<br /><br />Having no time to tell others about the power of Jesus to change lives. 
<br /><br />I guess the question is, has the devil been successful in his schemes? 
<br /><br />You be the judge!!!!! 
<br /><br />Does &quot;BUSY&quot; mean: B-eing U-nder S-atan's Y-oke? 
<br /><br />Please pass this on, if you aren't too BUSY! 
<br /><br />I don't think I know 10 people who would admit they love Jesus. 
<br /><br />Do You Love Him? 
<br /><br />IF YOU LOVE JESUS, PASS THIS ON!!!!!!!

<br /><br />Today's Scripture 
<br /><br />“For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does He withhold from those whose walk is blameless” (Psalm 84:11). 
<br /><br />Today's Word from Joel and Victoria 
<br /><br />What do you need from the Lord today? Do you need peace, provision, guidance? The Word of God promises that no good thing will He withhold from those who walk blamelessly before Him. Now you may be thinking, “Joel, I’m not perfect. How can I have a blameless walk?” The Good News is, when you receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior, you automatically have a new walk. The past is erased in God’s eyes. And sure, you may make mistakes but I John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” 
<br /><br />When you repent of your sins and receive God’s forgiveness you are cleansed and your walk is blameless. You have to understand that God wants to pour His favor and honor on you. If you feel like there is anything in your life that you need to be cleansed from, go to the Father today and confess it to Him. Let Him make you new so that you can receive the good things He has in store for you! Let Him be pour His blessing on you so that you can walk in victory all the days of your life! 
<br /><br />A Prayer for Today 
<br /><br />Heavenly Father, thank you for loving me and choosing to pour out your favor and blessing on me today. Thank you for giving me a new beginning and making me blameless in your eyes. Search my heart today and show me if there is anything that would keep me from you today. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<br /><br />Death was walking toward a city one morning and a man asked, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I'm going to take 100 people,&quot; Death replied. 
<br /><br />&quot;That's horrible!&quot; the man said. 
<br /><br />&quot;That's the way it is,&quot; Death said. &quot;That's what I do.&quot; 
<br /><br />The man hurried to warn everyone he could about Death's plan. 
<br /><br />As evening fell, he met Death again. &quot;You told me you were going to take 100 people,&quot; the man said. &quot;Why did 1,000 die?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I kept my word,&quot; Death responded. &quot;I only took 100 people. Worry took the others.&quot;

<br /><br />Today's Scripture
<br /><br />&quot;Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.&quot; (I John 4:4)
<br /><br />Today's Word from Joel and Victoria
<br /><br />It says in the Proverbs to keep your eyes fixed on the dreams and desires God has placed in your heart. This will keep you from focusing on the past and falling into the enemy's trap of self-pity. It's all about developing a godly self-image. It is important that we find out what God says about us through His Word, and boldly declare it! Joshua 1:8 tells us that when we meditate on, and declare the Word of God, we will be prosperous, successful, and wise. I hope you'll take hold of that promise and put it into practice every day of your life. Remember, you can overcome the past through Christ Jesus our Lord today!
<br /><br />A Prayer for Today
<br /><br />God, remind me that while I am in this world, I am not to be of this world-I belong to You. You made me in Your image and I pray that I can focus on all that is good and honorable in me. Help me to discover the perfect plan you have for my life. In Jesus' name - Amen.

<br /><br />Today's Scripture
<br /><br />&quot;...for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.&quot; (I John 5:4)
<br /><br />Today's Word from Joel and Victoria
<br /><br />As a child of God, you have the power of faith within you to overcome the world. That includes everything in the world, and everything the world brings your way! The Bible says that faith comes by hearing the Word of God (Romans 10:17). As you hear the Word of God and store it in your heart, your faith in God grows stronger. 
<br /><br />When the enemy tries to attack you through sickness, fear, worry, or financial mishaps, just use your faith by declaring the Word of God. Find scriptures to speak over your problem or whatever you are facing. Declare that perfect love casts out all fear! Declare that God shall supply all your needs! Declare that because you are born of God, you have faith to overcome the world!
<br /><br />A Prayer for Today
<br /><br />God, I am Your child and that means I am destined to live a life of victory. When the world gets to be too much for me to bear, remind me to take comfort in Your Word. Help me to store up Scripture verses in my head and my heart to help me overcome the trials I will face in this world. In Jesus' name – Amen.

<br />By: Bo Sanchez</strong>
<br /><br />Let me share with you five principles…
<br /><br />Key #1:
<br />Believe You’re Bigger
<br /><br />It’s common fact that we only use 10% of our brain’s capacity.
<br /><br />Can you believe that? We’re wasting 90% of what God has given to us!
<br /><br />I believe God has given us more capacities than we think we have.
<br /><br />The ultimate crime is that we belittle ourselves.
<br /><br />We think we’re insects, so we live an insect life, but actually—we’re giants!
<br /><br />Because of this, I believe you can earn a ten times more than whatever you’re earning right now. You can help ten times the number of people you’re helping now. You can serve ten times more than whatever service you’re doing now.
<br /><br />Don’t limit yourself.
<br />You’re bigger than you think you are.
<br /><br />Key #2:
<br />Be Consistent With The Fundamentals
<br /><br />Every morning, I enjoy time with God.
<br /><br />Every morning, I chew on His Word—the Bible.
<br /><br />Every morning, I pray, “Lord, let me love every person I meet today.”
<br /><br />Every morning, I read my life mission, my list of dreams, and my annual goals.
<br /><br />And throughout the day, instead of exposing myself to bad news, I digest good news available around me: I voraciously read inspiring books and listen to inspiring audio talks.
<br /><br />Every night, like a little boy, I kneel beside my bed and thank God for His blessings of that day.
<br />In other words, the reason why I live such an exciting life is because I’m boring.
<br /><br />I’m monotonous.
<br /><br />I’m repetitive.
<br /><br />I do the same basic things again and again and again and again…
<br /><br />I now realize that the reason I can do all those thrilling, exciting, exhilarating stuff is because I do the boring basics every single day of my life. Everyday, I’m grateful. Everyday, I think positive.
<br /><br />Everyday, I love. Everyday, I select what I watch, what I read, what I listen to—and stick to what can make me grow. Every single day.
<br /><br />The more I live on planet earth, the more I agree with Jim Rohn when he said that “There’s really nothing mysterious or magical about success. Success is simply the consistent application of fundamentals.”
<br /><br />Be boringly consistent when it comes to the basics.
<br /><br />And in time, you’ll find exciting success knocking at your door.
<br /><br />Key #3:
<br />Focus On Your Core Gift
<br /><br />I have very few talents. Honest!
<br /><br />I don’t know how to cook, how to dance, how to write a computer program, and how to solve the Rubix cube. I don’t know how to do geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. I’m totally lost in chemistry, physics, and biology. I also can’t fix a leaking faucet or do carpentry or repair my car.
<br /><br />But this is what I can do very well: Communicate.
<br /><br />So I focus my entire life on that one thing.
<br /><br />I write well and I speak well. Period.
<br /><br />And I delegate everything to people who are better than I am.
<br /><br />Ask yourself now: What is my core gift?
<br /><br />I have a general rule I follow in my life: I don’t like complicating things just to impress you. So instead of giving you 329 psychological questions filled with scientific babble to discover your core gift (so I could impress you on how intelligent I am), let me just boil it down to 2 very simple questions. Stop reading this book until you answered both of these questions.
<br /><br />What do you enjoy doing?
<br /><br />What are you good at
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s technology.
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s teaching.
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s selling stuff.
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s cooking.
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s music.
<br /><br />For some of you, it’s advanced trigonometry. (Yes, I’ve heard there are such strange creatures walking on the face of the earth.)
<br /><br />Key #4:
<br />Build Your Network
<br /><br />My wealth isn’t my money.
<br /><br />My real wealth is my network of friends.
<br /><br />Personally, I don’t think anything great is accomplished without a team.
<br /><br />Even Jesus had a team around him.
<br /><br />A few months ago, I was reading about the interesting world of horse-pulling competitions.
<br /><br />That’s where huge horses the size of elephants pull massive concrete blocks behind them.
<br /><br />Did you know that the grand champion horse could pull the incredible weight of 4,500 pounds? If the average weight of a Filipino is 140 pounds (which happens to be my weight before I eat my breakfast), that means this super horse could carry 32 Filipinos—without wheels! That monster could pull me, my wife, my kids, my parents, my siblings, their spouses, their kids, and all my in-laws combined.
<br /><br />And the second placer horse can pull only slightly lower than the first placer: 4,400 pounds.
<br />That was when the organizers got curious. If these two horses pulled together, how many pounds could they carry? Could they pull 8,900 pounds?
<br /><br />They harnessed both horses and were shocked with the results.
<br /><br />Both horses, when pulling together, carried the mind-blowing weight of 12,000 pounds. That’s
<br /><br />85 Filipinos.
<br /><br />My message? Teams are powerful.
<br /><br />Alone, I can do a lot of things. But with my team, I don’t add but multiply what I can do.
<br /><br />I keep networking. I circulate. I meet people. I build bridges.
<br /><br />So I surround myself with a bunch of people who have impeccable character and fantastic skills. I network with Mentors, Preachers, Administrators, Accountants, Programmers, Lawyers, Financial Wizards, Multi-millionaires, Media Experts, Businessmen, Architects, Engineers, etc…
<br />And everyday, I constantly expand my team.
<br /><br />Key #5:
<br />Create An Autopilot System
<br /><br />Every time I enter into a project, I always do it with a team around me. Never alone. And I choose my team well.
<br /><br />I have a very simple criteria: I choose men and women who are humble (teamplayers) and who are experts in their field. In other words, I search for impeccable character and fantastic skills.
<br /><br />And together, we create a system for the project that’s replicable and duplicable.
<br /><br />In other words, it’s got to run on autopilot without my direct supervision.
<br /><br />Here’s my ideal leader: If I appoint someone to be project head (or organization director or business manager), and after six months, I don’t want him to bother me anymore except for major directional issues. If he still bothers me for tiny matters, I’ve chosen the wrong leader—or
<br /><br />I trained him wrongly.
<br /><br />If You Love, The Universe Opens Up To You
<br /><br />Here’s what I’ve learned: Love is limitless! It has no boundaries.
<br /><br />I do what I do because I want to love people.
<br /><br />Each morning, I wake up and ask myself, “How can I bless people today?”
<br /><br />And so I stretch. I go just a teensy bit beyond what I think is my limit—and my capacities expand—because I want to bless the world.

<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Goodnews.visit.ws"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.Goodnews.visit.ws</a>
<br /><br />Today's Scripture
<br /><br />“‘…how can we know the way?’ Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me’” (John 14:5-6).
<br /><br />Today's Word from Joel and Victoria
<br /><br />Do you need direction in your life today? Not only is Jesus the way to life in eternity, but Jesus is the way to everything you need in this life here on earth. Do you need to know the way out of debt? Look to the Father through Jesus. Do you need to know the way to having better relationships…the way to overcome an addiction…to live in peace and joy? When you know Jesus, you know the Way.
<br /><br />No matter what you are facing today, no matter what challenges or obstacles are in your life, He will make a way for you even when you don’t see how. God loves you so much that He wants to strengthen and empower you to live in total victory. That’s why He sent His Son, Jesus, to this earth—to show you the way to live an abundant life! Open your heart today and receive all that God has given you through Jesus. As you do, you’ll see His hand lead you in the way of victory in every area of your life!
<br /><br />A Prayer for Today
<br /><br />Father in heaven, thank You for sending Your Son, Jesus, to show me the way. I invite You into every area of my life. Keep me close to You always. In Jesus’ Name. Amen.
