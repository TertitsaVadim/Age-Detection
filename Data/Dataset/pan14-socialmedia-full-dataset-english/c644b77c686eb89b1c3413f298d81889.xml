They actually have a chili cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio city park. The notes are from an inexperienced chili taster named Frank, who has visited from Springfield IL.
<br /><br />Frank: &quot;Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cooking contest. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judges table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.&quot;
<br /><br />Here are the scorecards from the advent: (Frank is Judge 3)
<br /><br />Chili #1 Eddie's Maniac Monster Chili
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- (Frank) What the hell is this stuff?! You could remove dried paint on my driveway. Took me two beers to put out the flames. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy!
<br /><br />Chili #2 Austin's Afterburner Chili
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- Exiting BBQ flavor; needs more peppers to be taken seriously.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- Keep this out of reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.
<br /><br />Chili #3 Ronny's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Needs more beans.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my back bone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting pie-eyed from all the beer...
<br /><br />Chili #4 Dave's Black Magic
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish, or other mild foods; not much of a chili.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-lb woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac?
<br /><br />Chili #5 Lisa’s Legal Lip Remover
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
<br /><br />Judge #3 – My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off may forehead, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I’m burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks.
<br /><br />Chili #6 Pam’s Very Vegetarian Variety
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous sulphuric flames. I pooped on myself when I farted and I’m worried it will eat through the chair! No one seems inclined to stand behind me anymore. I need to wipe my butt with a snow cone.
<br /><br />Chili #7 Carla’s Screaming Sensation Chili
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- Ho-hum; tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last minute. **I should take note that I am worried about Judge #3. He appears to be in a bit of distress, as he is cursing uncontrollably.
<br /><br />Judge #3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn’t feel a thing. I’ve lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are filled with lave to match my shirt. At least during the autopsy, they’ll know what killed me. I’ve decided to stop breathing; it’s too painful. Screw it; I’m not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I’ll just suck it through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.
<br /><br />Chili #8 Karen’s Toenail Curling Chili
<br /><br />Judge #1 -- The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.
<br /><br />Judge #2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild, nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge #3 farted, passed out, fell over, and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he’s going to make it. Poor fella, wonder how he’d have reacted to REALLY hot chili.

<br /><br />Why Parents Have Gray Hair
<br /><br />A father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed nicely made up and everything neat and tidy.
<br /><br />Then he saw an envelope propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, &quot;Dad&quot;. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands:
<br /><br />Dear Dad,
<br /><br />It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Mom.
<br /><br />I've been finding real passion with Joan and she is so nice. I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercings, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am but it's not only the passion, Dad, she's pregnant.
<br /><br />Joan says that we are going to be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood, enough for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.
<br /><br />Joan has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.
<br /><br />In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Joan can get better; she sure deserves it!
<br /><br />Don't worry Dad, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your grandchildren.
<br /><br />Your son, Chad
<br /><br />P.S. Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Tommy's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the report card that's in my desk drawer.
<br /><br />I love you! Call when it is safe for me to come home!

<br /><br />No one wanted to room with Steve because he snored so badly. They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him the whole time, so they voted to take turns.
<br /><br />The first night, John slept in Steve's room and came to breakfast the next morning with his hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot. The rest of the guys said, &quot;Man, what happened to you?&quot;
<br /><br />He said, &quot;Steve snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night.&quot;
<br /><br />The next night it was Garry's turn. In the morning, same thing--hair all standing up, eyes all blood-shot. Once again they asked, &quot;Man, what happened to you? You look awful!&quot;
<br /><br />He said, &quot;Man, that Steve shakes the roof. I couldn't sleep a wink. I just watched him all night.&quot;
<br /><br />The third night was Herb's turn. Herb was a big burly guy who loved to fish and hunt -- a man's man.
<br /><br />The next morning he came to breakfast bright eyed and bushy tailed. &quot;Good morning,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />The guys couldn't believe it! They said, &quot;Man, what happened?&quot;
<br /><br />He said, &quot;Well, we got ready for bed. I went and tucked Steve into bed and kissed him good night. He sat up and watched me all night long.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Good morning, &quot; said the young man. &quot;If I could take a couple of minutes of your time, I would like to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Go away!&quot; said the old lady. &quot;I haven't got any money!&quot; and she proceeded to close the door. Quick as a flash, the young man wedged his foot in the door and pushed wide open. &quot;Don't be too hasty!&quot; he said. &quot;Not until! you have at least seen my demonstration.&quot; And with that, he emptied a bucket of horse manure onto her hallway carpet. &quot;If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this horse manure from your carpet, Madam, I will personally eat the remainder.&quot;
<br /><br />The old lady stepped back and said, &quot;Well I hope you've got a darned good appetite, because they cut off my electricity this morning.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Maybe all I need is some fresh air,&quot; thought the man as he crawled outside.
<br /><br />He tried to stand up again, but fell face first into the mud.
<br /><br />&quot;Screw it,&quot; he thought. &quot;I'll just crawl home.&quot;
<br /><br />The next morning, his wife found him on the doorstep asleep.
<br /><br />&quot;You went out drinking last night, didn't you?&quot; she said.
<br /><br />&quot;Uh, yes,&quot; he said sheepishly. &quot;How did you know?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You left your wheelchair at the bar again.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Listen, you don't have to spend that kind of money, &quot; Mike replies. &quot;There's a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner. Just give it a urine sample and the computer'll tell you what's wrong and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars...a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor.&quot;
<br /><br />So Jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore. He deposits ten dollars, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits.
<br /><br />Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks.
<br /><br />That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure.
<br /><br />Jack hurries back to the drugstore, eager to check the results. He deposits ten dollars, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results.
<br /><br />The computer prints the following:
<br /><br />1. Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. 2. Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo. 3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab. 4. Your wife is pregnant...twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. 5. If you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better.

<br />John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to “clean up” the bird’s vocabulary.
<br />Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder.
<br />John, in desperation, threw up his hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute.
<br />Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said, “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”
<br />John was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, “May I ask what the turkey did?”

<br />An old prospector shuffled into town leading an old tired mule. The old man headed straight for the only saloon in town to clear his parched throat. He walked up to the saloon and tied his old mule to the hitch rail.
<br />As he stood there brushing some of the dust from his face and clothes, a young gunslinger stepped out of the saloon with a gun in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other. The young gunslinger looked at the old man and laughed, saying, 'Hey old man, have you ever danced?'
<br />The old man looked up at the gunslinger and said, 'No, I never did dance, -- and just never wanted to.' A crowd had gathered quickly and the gunslinger grinned and said, 'Well, you old fool, you're gonna' dance now,' and started shooting at the old man's feet.
<br />The old prospector in order to not get a toe blown off or his boots perforated was soon hopping around like a flea on a hot skillet and everybody was laughing fit to be tied. When the last bullet had been fired the young gunslinger, still laughing, holstered his gun and turned around to go back into the saloon. The old man turned to his pack mule, pulled out a double barreled shotgun, and cocked both hammers back. The loud, audible double clicks carried clearly through the desert air.
<br />The crowd stopped laughing immediately. The young gunslinger heard the sounds, too, and he turned around very slowly. The quiet was almost deafening.
<br />The crowd watched as the young gunman stared at the old timer and the large gaping holes of those twin barrels. He found it hard to swallow.. The barrels of the shotgun never wavered in the old man's hands.
<br />The old man said, 'Son, did you ever kiss a mule's ass?'
<br />The boy bully swallowed hard and said, 'No. But I've always wanted to.'
<br />There are two lessons for us all here: 1. Don't waste ammunition. 2. Don't mess with old people
