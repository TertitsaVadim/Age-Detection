If you cut you wrist you need to have a good reason or else its pointless. Even if you cut your list across the wrist it will take you longer to die, but if you cut down the wrist and cut the main artery you will bleed out faster and there's no way to stop the bleeding.  Now if you slice your throat you will need to cut the jugular vane so there is no way to stop the bleeding... You might think why do  know all this it's because I thought about it almost every day when I was 13 until I wawww.. After my 15th Bday i start to had second thoughts, now I think i might act like i am 13 again...
<br />don't know why I changed my mind... wish i had a reason... so that i could say this is why all above didn't kill me...but just wish there was some1 to give me a reason not 2.... life is pointless...

Your stuck on the lossing side of an endless battle. Also, it's related to love, love always has away of making you hurt your-self or someone around you. Love makes people turn into people they aren't, so they can feel what what is like to be truely loved, not liked, but have a purpose in life. To be there for someone that needs oyu. Love is hard to express to someone that has no idea you like them and you cannot approach because of your feelings towards them. It makes people crazy, thinking about what if I told her that I loved herand wanted to be with her, hold her, love her. But in love, like everything theres a risk,  that other person could feel differently bout you. This hurts, you may not show it but it does, and it will always hurt, there's no cure, but to try and try to earn their love if it's possible, be fore it's too late. Hopefuly you will find that person before your life is over, I hope I do.

I have feeling for her that I cannot express even in words I would kill for her to be with her, to save her. If she only knew how i felt bout her. I would still doubt if I could be with her. She's so beautiful, smart and funny. She has the most pretty smile that just makes you want to melt on first glance. I would die to give her life another chance. This feeling of love that I have inside of me for her makes me want to cut my-self to release it, but I know if I did i would have no reason for her and would loose her. But on the other hand, I cannot tell her how I feel due to self confidence, I surround my-self in lies, mystery and just wnat it to be true to my-self but cannot relize the harsh reality and see the light of day. I cover my self in a cloud of darkness... becomming more and more anti-social and paranoid, cannot bring my-self to tell her. Afraid of what will happen when  I cannot love her anymore....

<br />   My world is empty, my heart is broke, when I look into your eyes i begin to choke. I don't care about what people think about me and you, all I want to do is be with you. I looked into your eyes and fell for you. I'll never hurt you, all I want to do is be with you..
<br /><br />#2
<br />   My body aches for you. My mind cannot stop thinking about you. My heart belongs to you. I'll do anything to be with you, step in-front of anyone that tries to hurt you. It's hard to express how I feel towards you.... I hope I end up with you...
<br /><br />#3
<br />   I look at you and begin to stare. There's nothing I can do to stop looking at your beauty. I look at you sometimes and see you looking at me. I wonder if you feel the same for me. Tired of the temptation of not being with you.  I feel my-self giving up for you. I cannot look at you without thinking about how me and you could of been. Now I only see you with him...
<br /><br />#4
<br />   I wonder if she likes me or him next to me. You picked him over me. You know me more than him, but you like more of what you see and not how he really is. You made the wrong choice and left me sitting her all alone with no one but the people that are in the same situation like me...
