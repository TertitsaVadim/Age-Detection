The School offers two years long full time program as well as weekend courses giving a platform to the students in the field of Fashion Design, Photography, Interior Design, Visual Merchandising and Drama. The news is that the Fashion and Photography faculty will open its doors to international students also very soon this year. The curriculum and programs are designed by experienced professionals after a well thought process. One interesting fact about this institute is that the staff members are themselves artists and designers in their own rights and have combined teaching with their professional careers. In order to showcase students' talents, the school organizes fashion shows as well as exhibitions in galleries on a regular basis. The institute also opens the door for students to participate in both national and international competitions. Besides that students get the opportunity to intern with the top designers across the world. Giving sustainable employment prospects to the fashion graduates is a priority for the institute. No wonder then, talents produced every year are placed in Polish and international fashion companies. Bharat Sharma is a Delhi-based model who started his career with Gladrags. A model who takes his career with completes dedication, he is a hardcore fan of Ghazal and it reflects in his caller tune as well. He strongly feels that modelling requires no talent beyond good looks and a fit body. Here's a quick face off with the young lad; Your first crush on fashion. My starting days in modelling were not so good, though I did my first ramp show in Ireland for British Telecom. I was working with Infosys when I got a call for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Lakme Fashion Week</a> . until then, I was totally unaware about what modelling and fashion is all about? I thought it was very much organized and professional. 
<br /><br />How has life changed after modelling? The major change is I have started listening to others in the bitter way! Your best part experience so far. This was the first ad which I shot for ICICI Prudential where it took 15 hrs for a 30 sec ad! I can never forget this lifetime experience. Are male models more vulnerable to casting couch. If you go 4-5 years back, it was true but now it’s different. Qualities which make you different from other model community. I am friendlier in a true way and can’t be fake as most of my fellow models are. I always prefer my education and knowledge over my looks. 
<br />Walking in first ever Men’s Week was really great feeling. Now Indian designers have finally got the time to think of the Male model. The positive and negative traits of being a model. 
<br /><br />If you say Negative then it's a long list but to be precise, it's a short term career or say it's not a career for men, it's a very dicey profession and my advice is to first finish your studies get some professional degree to be on the safer side and then try for it. Positive trait is you get in contact with so many people which sometimes actually changes life and most importantly People start recognizing you. Nudity in ads is a sensational issue nowadays? Would u ever do such ads. Yes if you have to live in Rome you have to live like a Romeo. Is the supermodel era over. Gone are the days when Supermodel was a term. Now-a-days, it's so tough to make a stand in the industry due to cut throat competition there is less work and more candidates so everyone is a model now but the supermodel is in the graveyard. 
<br />Designers you die for?
<br />Raghavendra Rathore and JJ Valaya.
<br />How are show directors to deal with?
<br />It takes time to create a rapport with the choreographers and if you are good in buttering half your job is done. All choreographers have their favourites so here the job changes from getting work to getting into the choreographer's favo's list. Till now Aparna Behl and Alison Kanuga are those whom I admire. 
<br />Style icon Shashi Taroor, the way he speaks and think its a personality to die for.
<br />Health regime
<br />Eat healthy be healthy. I believe in one thing what you eat is what you look. A proper work out and cardio is like worshipping your body.
<br />The one thing you most scared of Losing my memory. How is Karan (Johar) as a designer. I did his fittings yesterday for the finale show at ICW and as a designer he is really amazing. He is blessed with a very good styling sense. He is doing the show for which bridal, casuals as well as party wear lines with really flashy shoes kept in store.

In the last 45 days, India has seen as many as four fashion weeks. Be it the second string  Kolkata Fashion Week which is nascent yet promising, or the debutante India Men's Week, not forgetting the established <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Lakme Fashion Week</a>  and the recently culminated India Couture Week and now the fifth one beckons, the Big Daddy of them all - <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week</a>  . This one is about putting ICW under a microscope. It was jinxed, many felt. Its existence came last year at a time when FDCI saw a split with Sumeet Nair, who is now practically non existent in the fashion frat. This time around, it was postponed from July to August to September to finally in October. Next year, no one knows if it will happen.  The first day stood cancelled, apparently Abu and Sandeep did not get enough passes to accommodate their guests and backed out on grounds of bias. Later a statement was released – We stand cohesively with the FDCI - at least that was heartening! Fashion critics kept insinuating that collections showcased were hardly Couture, barring a select few designers of course. Then there were a few who showed similar collections as shown in previous fashion weeks, perhaps one can't be blamed since fashion weeks are being held too back to back to be able to churn out a new collection. But then which medical study proves that one needs to show at every 'week' to stay healthy? It was nice to see most designers break the bridal genre of couture in India. Like Suneet Verma says, Indian couture is very relevant to Indian fashion, therefore it's necessary to have a couture week in India. We are designers working in a country that has a treasure of incredible textiles, embroideries and other related crafts which enables us to do super luxe, handmade one of a kind custom made clothing this is a very unique experience compared to the west which has really become about the ready to wear and mass volume collections for most design houses. Even a Varun Bahl who had one of the most stunning collections says, I think India demands High fashion and HDIL did the smartest thing to be the first one to introduce it in India. But the sets this time were not much to talk about, were they?  In my opinion the entire Grandeur was beautiful but there is always scope for improvement he politically accepts.
<br /><br />Another point of contention was the presence of too much Bollywood. But then how can one avoid that in the city of Mumbai? Nachiket Barve has a better reasoning, Fashion relates to lifestyle and high fashion is mostly accepted by the Bollywood crowd so even too much of Bollywood is not harmful for a Couture Week. We agree, but only to a point, beyond which it all seems like a farce! A family reunion sort of a thing where one star walks for one friend or wife or sister or whoever The Being Human show had nothing Couture, we we'll hand it over to them for staging fashion for a good cause, how much ever un-couture the fashion may be. FDCI supremo Sunil Sethi said, It was the biggest show ever, yes as far as star power is concerned, it certainly was.
<br /><br />As for the buying, Kimaya's Pradeep Hirani said, Kimaya attends 53 fashion weeks across the globe in a year, ICW is one of them. Well, ain't much to read between the lines here, except for the fact that couture sales is individual centric and doesn't old much relevance for volume stockers like fashion houses and designer stores. Inference: Do we need a Couture Week? Yes. Is this one serving the purpose? Partially. Is it state of the art? No. Will it happen again? Hope so!

Worried how to get one? Don't be not with Stylekandy.com around, as we chalk down the latest trend in bags, belts, shoes, jewellery and other add ons for Autumn/Winter 2009.
<br /><br />Clutches and Totes in a myriad of colours define most of A-W 09 bagging. Go for turquoise, fuchsia and gold. Watch out for the Wide Shouldered Bags in a plethora of colourful prints are another must have. One can also pick the classic shades of white, black, brown, grey, plain or checked colours. Chain strap bags will continue to rule this season and can be worn as a lovely clutch or across-the-body style. Slouches are out, Satchel sare in. Don’t throw the slouch yet, you can carry it occasionally as casual mall wear. LV's 'Epi' bags will storm the stores early on, but fade out by early next year, just like a fad!
<br /><br />Shoes: If you have a fetish for long high heeled boots, this is the season to flaunt them. Over-the-knee boot sare a must-have, so are thigh high boots.  As a replacement for the fun and bright colours of summer, gothic tones like black, dark blue, dark green, dark-violet and red will rule. Hybrid (platform toes) Stilettos and oversized Wedges refuse to fade away, but they are simpler and stylish, unlike the more flamboyant summery ones. Lacey Ankle Boots from Rober to Cavalli and Jimmy Chooare going to take your breath away.
<br /><br />Jewellery: Bigger, the Better! Studded stones, chains and gemstones you can wear them all, as long as they are big! Statement pieces are back. Chunky rings larger than life cocktail rings, leather bracelets and extravagant necklaces by John Galliano, Marc Jacobsare the ones which one should look for.
<br /><br />Closer home, beaded accessories from Stoffa, Malaga and Little Shilpa set the tone for laidback winter. Geometrical lines will be the defining feature of Fall-Winter 2009-10. White Gold and diamonds will be talk of the town making a comeback with a lot of bling! Add-ons: The all time classic leather glove is available in two versions- the elbow length glove or the palm sized glove. Go for a pair of velvet gloves when dressing up for formal occasions to look elegant and sexy. For more information you can see <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Lakme Fashion Week</a>  and find details.
<br /><br />Scarves in knits will be a rage as always. The lumberjack plaid and the Seersucker print will ensure that you stay in the scarf of fashion! Belts should be majorly restricted to over the dress ones, mostly worn over a warm shift dress or trench coat. Fedora hats and the Mafia Collector’s hat are pretty much indelible if you are a hat person. Colours for all are mostly earthy and muted with a dash of metallic.

Born and brought up in Hong Kong, the designer is trained in Pattern Making at the Thai Designs Institute of Patternmaking through a 2 year intensive garment construction course. For SS/10, the designer has tried to merge summer functionality and the feeling of joy and fantasy. This summer, functionality, wearability and longevity of a garment is the key. Along with that it's a time for escapism, a time to bring back joy and fantasy in the way we dress she explained. An exclusive fabric that she has used in the collection is the French chiffon. It's a lovely material, which is very light and has a lot of sheen. It's ideal for evening wear. Nimirta has some light, summer trench coats and Lycra jackets. Then there are jewelled skirts with subtle embellishments along with some long flowy cocktail dresses, maxis and lots of separate pieces she adds. The entire collection has been inspired by the art-deco of the 1930's and 1940's. Though it's a glamorous collection, it will also carry an old-world charm. With hues of silver, steel grey, turquoise and pink, her palette is a fresh and light collection with detailing in different forms of pleating, gathered and twisted necklines and Swarovski accents. The fabrics which used are mostly like cotton silks, sheerchiffons, lightweight satins and georgettes. My collection will target all age groups starting from 16yrs to 40 yrs, as I have dresses which are classic but at the same time subtle, she concludes. A unique blend of art and fashion recently came alive to the capital when designer Poonam Bhagat presented a unique interpretation of installation art by Vishal Joshi and fashion inspired by world renowned artist - JOAN MIRO, in her designs which are going to be displayed at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.
<br /><br />I have interpreted Miro's Art with a twist and paired it with a kaleidoscopic palette of abstract designs created at TAIKA and interwoven into a storyline on western silhouettes said Poonam. The designs are essentially Pret- contemporary and edgy yet classic, dramatic and understated. Miro art is hard to describe. It is characterized by brilliant colours combined with simplified forms that remind me of drawings made by children, playful and naïve. In contrast to the image of his art, he was a solid, hard-working man who preferred to come to gallery exhibitions in dark business suit. The canvas, of course, is ivory. Solid &amp; sheer natural fabrics like linens, chander is, cotton silks and organza in egg white vividly and dramatically embroidered and appliqued in Miro-esque designs flirt with the female form. The silhouettes are non fussy which consist mostly of sheath, bias, cocoon and tulip dresses, wide bottomed paper bag pants, skirts and tops form the backdrop for MIRO ART.
<br /><br />All theses designs are very affordable, in fact, the affordability factor has always helped us in securing orders from at least 20 multi designer markets and boutiques all over India season after season. The designs can be worn by any age group whether she is 18 years old or 49 years of age she ended on a happy note.

		<document id="401471b38da853b65485ab36cc26a151" url=""><![CDATA[Management Fashion Business<br/><br/>Britain's second-largest department store chain, Debenham swhich trades from 154 outlets in Britain and Ireland plus 52 international franchise stores, has been in news of late. The latest we hear is that the chairman John Lovering has announced his stand down from his post next year. Mr Lovering has been chairman since December 2003 and led the retailers flotation on the stock market in May 2006. His departure has triggered a boardroom shake-up at the company. The reason for Lovering to quit will be revealed when Debenhams will publish its full-year results very soon.
<br /><br />Lately the worm recession ate up many big brands; even Debenhams couldn't be untouched from it and saw a downfall in sales by 7% in past couple of months. Also, Texas Pacific Group, CVC and Merrill Lynch Private Equity invested £600 million to acquire Debenhams in 2003, before trebling their investment in three years after selling off freehold property and cutting costs. That left Debenhams with £1 billion of debt and little room to improve its bottom-line performance during times of tougher trading conditions.
<br /><br />After three profit warnings since the float, the Debenhams management team has finally delivered a series of solid results, reducing its debt and taking market share from its rivals. Despite many ups and downs the brand has managed to retain itself in the fashion business which is quite tuff, now the question is, how the absence of John Lovering would affect the brand, sales and equity?
<br /><br />From my point of view, marketing is really important! Basically we are living in a very competitive environment and everybody is trying to get their own space under the sky. So to reach our clients and carve a niche for ourselves, marketing plays a very important role. What is more important, being commercial or being creative. The industry is a blend of both. Sometimes we know that a few pieces we make are not saleable at all, but we still make it to show our creativity. At times designs are extremely commercial which attract customers and involve more people and business.
<br /><br />It’s actually a catch 22 situation. It won't be wrong to say that this tool can overpower fashion at times. Sometimes people don't care about the clothes if a Bollywood celebrity is wearing it. It's like winning over the scenes. Your future plans. Well there are more clothes coming from me, some going to be extremely right and some going to be definitely wrong (Chuckles). But before doing all that I want to have lots of fun and then get back to work.

		<document id="db474919f3a824688cd8e2aafd0fdeb3" url=""><![CDATA[Beautiful Fashion Trendy Collection<br/><br/>Known for her swish designs, designer Anamika Khanna showcased her summer line at WIFW on the first day. The brand itself explains explains the story and raise the expectation for a beautiful trendy collection. Carrying forward her intrinsic sensibility of design, she created a set with hanging unlit bulbs in a series, also the heavy chain accessories used as neck pieces was something distinct but nothing bizarre. There were dresses, jackets, long jackets, kaftans and a lot more using various techniques such as cut and mesh work, however the showstopper garment was the same that we witnessed at Couture Week’08, also one of the pieces was a replica of the costume she carried at the IIFA awards 2009.
<br /><br />This was followed by Ashish N Soni. The audience witnessed a come back of little back dress in variations. We could see a little influence of the latest Manish Arora collection with ‘circular contours’ used as motifs in Ashish’s collection. The geeky goggles were witnessed at Nari’s show at LFW’AW 09, however, the nerdy look, messy hair and casual attitude of models on the runway gave a different essence to the show. The front row was full of serious buyers including Alka Nishar from AZA, Neha Hirani from Kimaya and a host of international buyers from Japan and France. Sunil Sethi, designers, Narendra Kumar and Nachiket Barve were also spotted there. All in all, a decent show! The Reviews:Alka Nishar (AZA):Anamika was very good as usual, her jackets and dresses were beautiful, and it’s good to see some serious fashion happening here. Ashish’s collection was reminiscent of little black dresses, actually, dresses are a big trend these days! Nachiket Barve (designer): I think more than one show, it’s the atmosphere that I am quite impressed with, I find more seriousness here. Known for is grandeur, ace designer Tarun Tahiliani unveiled his glamorous SS’10 collection at WIFW on 24th of Oct. Not only the sets but the collection was also grand and luxurious. Sticking to his traditional style, the designer showcased his Indian collection comprising of sarees, lehengas dresses and a lot more. Apparently a few pieces amongst the entire assortment were recycled from his previous collections shown at Delhi Fashion Week collection. However, his last sequence had a brand new essence comprising dresses, sarees, anarkalis and long dresses with variations. By the way, no rule book mentions that previous. The first glance of the set was actually a baharon phool barsao moment for the audiences! This hanging garden had a complete essence of floral world of fantasy with birds, peacocks and the waterfalls on the runway but lacked a little professional finish.
<br /><br />Apparently the ramp overshadowed the attire a little, however the name ‘TT’ is big enough to create a murmuring ‘wow’ sound echoing in the entire arena which was no surprise element at all. By and large it was a houseful show in comparison to the entire day and the arena overflowed with professionals, buyers, designers like Rohit Bal and people like Meher Rampal and so on. The Reviews: Lauwalah (Buyer from Kuwait):Tarun has become my favorite for last two seasons and the Indian touch in his designs just takes my heart away. The Indian essence has become global now and people actually look forward to that. Meher Rampal (ex model):Tarun stole away my hearts, as always!

At 11:00 p.m; when the show finally began, it had been through security lapses, air conditioning failure, a flood of gate crashers and an irate Rohit Bal who frantically tried to get his special guests into the show, while desperately trying to filter the uninvited ones. Inside the MSA, the din was pandemonium-ic and restless, media having had to wait for over an hour in their seats amongst a flurry of lotuses- on the ramp, off the ramp, inside the ramp, beside the ramp and behind the ramp! When Laxmi Rana opened the show, the roar could have put the Lions of Tsavo to shame but it was purely due to the anticipation and relief, not exhilaration or extolling. As for the clothes, it was the copulation of lotuses once again anarkal is v/s jodhpur is both caught in a perpetual duel trying to bag more of the coveted flower that appeared and re-appeared till it established itself as the only motif! White and Gold formed the moot palette, occasional deep stone colours like burgundy, coral red and rust orange made their presence felt on typically layered silhouettes that Gudda is known for. Whirling dervishes of Turkey and Origami of Japan continued to find representation in his clothes. Muzzamil Ibrahim performed a mini striptease, revealing his ripped 6 packs, much to the delight of the female audience. Then it was one Bahl for another Bal! Designer and close friend Varun Bahl repaid the favour of Rohit relinquishing his drink to watch the former's show two days back, by walking for him. Incidentally, Manish Malhotra was slated to walk too, but he got busy with the filmier things of his life in Dubai! Cousin Aarti Suredranath also made an entry in an embellished lehenga, heavy enough to make turning and walking back quite an ordeal for the lady! Just when everyone expected Lady Katrina Kaif to walk out with Prince Charming Ranbir Kapoor - The Prince Group performed a breathtaking gig for over fifteen minutes, depicting parts of the Gita through dance forms. It was enthralling, but could have been more strategically placed at the start of the show. Katty in a blingy, layered, short dress and Kapoor in a beige sherwani and churidar brought the house down! Rohit danced his typical moves and bowed with a Namaste to bring the fourteenth edition of Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week to a fitting end. 
<br /><br />Designer duo Lecoanet Hemant'chose to show their A/W line at the WLIFW s/www. in style! They captivated the audience with their thematic show as LH presented a in season collection with foot tapping scores and ground breaking choreography with an equal punch of drama thrown in for a good measure.  Besides the collection, the runway covered with military print was seemingly in synch with the inspiration. In the first sequence, riveted jackets, tapered pants riveted on both the sides and fur tops in the palette of beige, burnt orange, brown and black ruled the runway. Doing away with the norm of having the perfect models, the designers brought back yesteryear’s beauty  Simar Duggal to open their western wear line. Book writer  Ira Trivedi and model Tejaswani also walked for the designer duo.
<br />Audiences were surprised when a middle aged man appeared on the ramp wearing a grey suit and was suddenly accosted by a bulky teenager, starting a freaking fight between the two, which is when one figured out that the next sequence is all about the conflicts between a father and his son!! 
<br /><br />This sequence saw an example of perfect tailoring with a structured edgy collection. Ultimately the last sequence came presenting the concept of unconventional happy couples. The line comprised of dresses and gowns for women and mostly suits and overcoats for men. Military caps and stoles and grunge hair added on to the fabulous styling of the garments.
<br /><br />The last story was all about unconventional couples. This is where quite a few non-models walked the ramp. Trench coats with overlapping lapels in muted shades ruled for men while for women it was the more classy dresses with mannish detailing. This was the only show where people of all age group walked the ramp presenting different strata of society with versatile concept. The front row was overflowing with buyers, designer and the biggies of WIFW. It all surged to another level with a post show party in a sponsor lounge at the venue.

Heavy makeup, different styles of hair-do, sometimes handy and sometimes unmanageable clothes. yet the moment a model steps on the ramp, they have to give it their best, hide their discomfort if any and present the creations in the mostly lively manner. In this compilation, one will get to know what models have to share about backstage madness and excitement at the recent <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Wills Lifestyle</a>  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">India Fashion Week</a>  held at Pragati Maidan in the capital. Mumbai-based model Alesia Raut who walked for the first time at WIFW, says, The venue was quite confusing for me. (Even after providing quick shuttle service for everyone Alesia was puzzled.) She continues, On the first day, we did face some problems with the food arrangements as we had to go out to have our food. It was little difficult with all make up, costumes and schedules but as soon as we brought it to the notice of the authorities, it was rectified and from the second day onwards, I had a ball! Veteran model Nethra Raghuramanadded that she had a smooth sailing fashion week this time. 
<br /><br />Defending all the issues mentioned, Pia Trivedipolitically added, With obvious reasons, while planning for gala event organizers do tend to forget such tit-bit issues, so no complains. Ashish Choudhary a rookie model in the circuit shared, Though I walked only for Gudda’s show, there was superb energy level backstage obviously they needed to create separate space for male and female models (With a wink) though we guys don’t care, he continues, but as for the female models their privacy and space is very important hence it was a bigger and better backstage for them. As there were hardly 7or 8 male models for Gudda's show, the changing room was also smaller and the passage to the ramp was really tight, female models in their huge outfits faced most difficulty also when all the models were 'squeezed' by the security, the moment a celeb had to go by hence it was all crazy but at the end, completely worth it because it was a hit! So how did FDCI manage to provide some much needed relaxation for the models? The answer was the Kingfisher Lounge especially booked for the models. It was fun to be there this time, there was proper security, with only choreographers being allowed to enter our zone. We relaxed on the bean bags with cushions, listened to music, read books…without any hassles. 
<br /><br />Pia chuckled. On the other hand Tinu Verghese has a different opinion. WIFW is getting better with every passing year. I felt the Kingfisher lounge was nice but the red colour all around in there was a bit too intense for relaxation. Ashish added with a sense of sarcasm, It was nice with comfy seating (except the mosquito bites), beer and wine available in large quantity so it was great. On backstage help, Nethra shared, Assistants were great…thankfully my helper Poojan was fantastic…simply amazing. The problem which caused a lot of havoc was the chilling temperature at the venue. Air Conditioners were too effective, but once they were turned off the place used to radiate heat! On a lighter note Tinu said, Like everyone else, helpers have their good days and bad days. I just hope that her bad days are not clashing with mine! Alesia who feels the grand finale was the most difficult show to prepare for further continued, Gone are the days when backstage used to be all messy. Today it is more organized; helpers were all fashion professionals. While we all noticed how the models slipped on their re-entry on the ramp during the finale, Nethra unveiled the reason behind it, During the rehearsals by the Prince Dance group (who performed a 15 min gig), the acrylic paints on their body dripped on the ramp because of heavy sweating and hence during our re-entry, most of the models skidded. In addition to it, Ashish added, there was a water leakage on the ceiling, at the passage runway. So while waiting for the turn to hit the ramp all models had to stand squeezed towards a side to avoid water on the garment. Kudos to the models for putting up with the lapses in the amenities and still giving thumbs up performances! As for the organisers, well, there’s always scope for improvement as always for everyone nothing too earth shattering to complain against them, is there now?

Inspired by iconic writer Ayn Rand, the show commenced with an audio visual presentation, throwing some light on the inherent darkness of the subject that is beyond the judgment of good and evil. The backdrop was also dark and had an edgy entrance. As the A-V got over, two hunting spotlights just started moving in the darker area of the ramp and a few minutes later everything stopped as models started unveiling the collection baptized- Ego. Silhouettes mostly took the form of deforming architecture and achieved sharp and edgy look which included shift T-dress, Foiled cotton overcoats, pin tucked leather jackets, satin shorts and skirts, leather pants and so on. 
<br /><br />Bringing back the concept of power dressing for women, the designer’s bevy mostly had futuristic looks with padded shoulders.

The Reviews: Nachiket Barve (designer): Though I haven’t seen his collections before, this one was really nice. Imad Fradj (French Buyer): The best show I have witnessed so far at WIFW this time! Meher Castelino (fashion critic): He conveyed his message beautifully with a nice, quick show. I quite liked it. 
<br /><br />This was the first well attended show of the last day of WIFW. A vintage sofa and a trunk comprised a stark set where each and every model stopped to pose before commencing her walk. It was an interesting touch but a trifle monotonous after the first few walks! Known for their design philosophy that works at reviving the traditional Indian art of textile and handicraft, Kotwara added one more element to their collection by showcasing a line of western prêt garments with strong Indian sensibilities. The designer couple once again leveraged on their forte intricate brocade and embroidery presented a line of ethnic wear and went on to showcase a range of western silhouettes.

Gayatri is known for her elegant dressy signature look, made an effort to break her evening, cocktail dresses image but the effort was quite visible. For the Spring-Summer 2010, the designer has used flowy fabrics mainly satin, georgettes, silk satin, linen, crepe silk and taffeta silk crafted into body flattering silhouettes. The collection had a range of jumpsuits, draped bustier tops, and mini-skirts. Few pieces of one shouldered dress with draped silhouette featured multi-string detailing and hand painted embellishments. The black and white one shouldered tunic with bubble hem and embroidered flowers was well applauded. This was followed by a line up of tunic dresses with cord work embroidery by the young <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">fashion designers</a>  Tanvi Kedia. With a girlie feel to the collection, the designs mostly saw pleated long dresses, kaft an gowns and long skirts. The designer has nicely experimented with the Indian handcraft and traditional craftsmanship. Some of the clothes had well knitted and intricate colourful sequenced embroidery work as the neckline. 
<br /><br />Abhishek Dutta presented his new collection – Tomorrow land. Asymmetrical hemlines and uneven cuts depict the uncertainty in future and hence the title. Abhishek played a lot of khaki fabric to create his jackets and dresses. He had his models faced masked in translucent black and were accessorized in black leggings and full sleeves gloves. This show witnessed a balanced presentation of menswear and womens wear. Model Pia Trivedi looking stunning in an orange hued dress, was the show stopper. 
<br /><br />Charu Prasher had an interesting start to her show. A group of giggling girls in floral dresses came walking the ramp and then Tinu Verghese one among them took over the ramp and started the show. It was a blossoming, flowering and budding season for Charu Parashar and with this the designer is aiming at exploring the feminine and romantic side of a woman. Sunflowers, palm green and rosy pinks ruled the palette. And to suit this floral theme, the models walked the ramp with floral baskets and bunch of roses and lilies. Blooming sunflowers prints presented in an array of dresses in bright yellow colour were quite apt for the spring summer season. Seema and Swapnilhad a mix of both western and Indian silhouettes in their Spring-Summer line up. A season of Romance – the collection is inspired by the charm and beauty of spring and summer. Model Shonali Rosarioopened the show for the designer duo flaunting a white lehenga with the blouse heavily embellished with metallic studs. Most of the garments had a sequence work with silver thread which offered a rich look to the ssarees and dresses. Lisa Hayden looked royal in a black draped dress. The Review: Gul Panag, actor: I loved Seema-Swapan, they had such amazing collection of saris. Both the shows were at either ends of the spectrum; even Charu was great with her Boho-floral pieces. Very feminine! Meher Castellino, fashion critic: Nothing very new but Charu presented some bright colours on the runway. Avigyan Prakash, News presenter: lots of colours loved the collection.

Come December, the city is going to witness the largest fashion week of the country, or so they claim!

		<document id="9fadd7a26375e28b0f585b5242f36133" url=""><![CDATA[Ahmedabad Fashion Week 2009<br/><br/>This won't come as a surprise! By now you and I are used to hearing feelers of such news practically every week! This one is called Ahmedabad Fashion Week (AFW) tentatively to be held from 27th-29th of Nov. The week will last for three days and they promise to showcase young and established design talents including regional boutiques and jewellery collections. Though the organization is still running on the meandering track to finalize the big names of the industry which is not a tuough task when offering an all expense paid show! But despite trying to buy support, it's not that easy afterall to convince someone for lending their name to an unborn baby! Ahmadabad based designer Digvijay Singh who has been a part of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Lakme Fashion Week</a>  for quite some time now, states, - Ahmadabad is the hub for fabrics and textiles and this event can attract good business if done properly. but it seems AFW is going to be more like AFF (Ahmadabad Fashion Fair) due to the involvement of local boutiques and jewellery stores. We have to wait and watch to see the outcome as things are still shaping up at their end. 
<br /><br />Though for designers there is no harm in doing a paid show or getting a store opening opportunity in the city, what happens to real business in such circumstances is a point of contest. Vineet Dhingra (owner of Chamomile) comments-Even though I'm not aware of the Ahmadabad <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Fashion Week</a>  and as of now Chamomile might not be participating in it, I believe that Fashion weeks are a good opportunity for media, buyers, designers and the fashion connoisseurs to come together. From the perspective of Fashion retail, there is now a greater need for focusing on ground realities and making the business of fashion more viable for both buyers and sellers. Designer Rahul Mishra, an NIDian from the city informed that he received an invitation to be a part of AFW. Fashion Weeks mushrooming everyday is not good for our current fashion scenario. India is still not such a big fashion hub where we require those many fashion weeks but the current truth is- we have more fashion weeks than the number of fashion consumers and followers which is definitely not favourable. 
<br /><br />There has been enough discussion on the number of fashion weeks questioning the authenticity of it and everyone has different views about this. The question is- what is the purpose of doing a fashion week and do the ones sprouting everyday solve any of the purposes or just appear as entertainment and publicity events? It is perhaps a question each one of the following has to answer- the media, the designer and the buyer.

The soiree saw some new designers like Aditi Was san joining the Sam saara family who unveiled her latest line of fashion wear crafted from the finest leather. Talking to us she revealed, My collection has a European feel this is something new to this industry, India has never been exposed to it and I think this is the right time since the fashionable people of this country are ready for this! she claimed. With a line of chic leather jackets, the designer aims to be one of the firsts to be solely into leather wear. We have been doing this since many decades and who better than Sam saara to support us, she added. One can expect some more designs in footwear and bags in the next season from Lady Wassan! Another designer, Preeti Chandra who was seen wearing a bright purple printed jumpsuit showcased her Fall-Winter 2009 collection  in an exotic palette of spicy ginger, midnight navy, toxic violet, brown and muted shades of oyster grey and pearl white. Most of the dresses are party-wear, woven mainly in woollen tweeds, velvets, flowing chiffons, silk and georgettes. Minimalistic embellishments define my work, since the wedding season is over, so one can find less of sequence works in gold, bronze and copper, she shared. 
<br /><br />Sanjay Kapoor of Genesis Colors played the perfect host. Though the third designer, Nandita Mahtani was quite late to arrive, she was quick to cover up by revealing the secret behind her association with Samsaara, this is for the first time that I have joined hands with Sam saara in the capital city. I have a list of clients here. I am trying to come up with my own store, but with Sam saara being on my side it will be better now. Nandita's collection under the label Ananya comprises a line of evening wear and cocktail dresses. Jumpsuits, sexy dresses, short skirts crafted in flowy chiffons and shimmering georgettes with heavy embellishments define her latest collection. The colour palette includes lots of white, soft pinks, green and blue. Designer Priyali Chopra who, due to reasons best known to her, couldn’t make it for the celebration, she had a stylish collection of footwear doing the proxy for her.

		<document id="46b0b52afa8202e3b2f6eb0731d3edf" url=""><![CDATA[Supermodel Beauty Tips<br/><br/>German supermodel Claudia Schiffer has decided to quit the runway and launch her own clothing line. Following the footsteps of fellow supermodels Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford the 39 years old beauty is now all set to launch her own fashion line and enjoy the show from the front row rather than doing a catwalk. I have been approached so many times over the last 20 years but it has never been the right time. Now, I would consider it but it would have to be the right thing. They would need to be clothes that I would want to wear, Schiffer confirmed to the sources. I have finished with the catwalk and not miss it, she was reported in media. Of late Claudia Schiffer and designer Karl Lagerfeld two of the most recognized personalities in the fashion world, were in Argentina for a photo shoot for Chanel. Both were invited by the Argentine model Ivan de Pineda. The shoot was delayed due to climatic conditions. Ultimately, this was done a few weeks after the supermodel announced her retirement from the catwalk. According to sources, Schiffer informed that she will not get on the runway though she will continue to work in fashion. The interesting part is, not long after she was first discovered; many people thought she would never be more than a catalogue queen, as outlined by Aline Soulier's memories of Claudia's first shoot. However surprisingly, during her hay-days, Claudia was arguably one of the most recognizable faces in the early-to-mid 1990s. Also, the supermodel holds the record for the top model with the highest number of magazine covers. Yes, the German babe has been featured on more than 900 magazine covers. But despite this, her raw beauty shone through and she will forever be remembered as the ’90s it girl. Now all eyes are glued to her new fashion line that promises to be as chic and the chick herself.
<br /><br />Though the capital city has, restaurants, art galleries and fashion destinations one too many this new innovative venture by designer Nakul Sen  will offer you the perfect blend of Art, Food and Fashion- all under one roof! In a joint collaboration with the Portuguese Embassy, the designer has conceptualized a unique amalgamation of style, indulgence and opulence named- O Palacio. Set amidst a Portuguese backdrop, the destination with serene and tranquil ambience comprises four fashion design studios, a fine dining restaurant-Casa Portuguesa and an art gallery-Galeria De Arte. 
<br /><br />This concept can be seen more as a cultural exchange. We wanted to take our concepts and ideas beyond fashion and the Portuguese Embassy and designers were quite supportive from the day we started working towards this dream, emphasized Nakul, holding a glass of red wine. The opening exhibition, ‘Living Art Expanse’ marks the launch of the art gallery, displaying contemporary creativity by Indian and International artists. The creative space offers some selected paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, digital videos, installations and public art. High end womenswear line by Nakul himself and also Shyam Narayan Prasad, Gayatri Khanna and Zoya the multi-designer house is up for the grab. Talking to us, designer Shyam Narayan Prasad shared, Nakul’s idea sounded nice so thought of associating with him. We’re aiming at changing the collection racks four or five times every month and have kept the pricing reasonable starting from Rs 2,700 to 7,000. Interestingly, Nakul, along with his prêt and exclusive lines has also found his passion in jewellery designing and is planning to come up with his line of shoes and accessories too! The only designer who couldn’t make for the celebration was Gayatri Khanna but her opening collection for O Palacio presented the designs which she showcased at her solo show for Mercedes Benz. Zoya one of the most celebrated names in the fashion industry stocks designs by Wendell Rodricks, Priyadarshini Rao, Gaurav Gupta, Savio Jon, Arjun Saluja, Nachiket Bharve, Gauri &amp; Nainika and the Kolkata based label, Vizyon. Come to gourmet, Casa Portuguesa one of the most acclaimed restaurants promises to present a sumptuous palette of authentic Portuguese cuisine. The comfy and warm ambience of the restaurant offers a fine dining space for fifty people allowing one to be themselves. If you are really among the lucky ones Fransico Sousa the chef and the owner himself may play his guitar and entertain you! The designer added that the restaurant will be shortly opening by November 20.

Designer Sanchita Ajjampur was rewarded with the award for best designers category of female and Manish Malhotra got the same for males category. Lisa Haydon was selected as the best model in India. Kalki won an award for theatres. Anisha Beg received the trophy for the best television personality. The stylist of the year was Ambika Pillai who proudly thanked by saying I know I deserved it. Model Pia Trivedi got the maximum votes for television and VJ category but couldn't make it for the evening. Zoya Akhtar was chosen as the best director and Mridula Koshi the best writer.

Shreyash Talpade, Ritiesh Deshmukh, Atul Kasbekar, Rahul Bose, Angad Bedi, Sahil Shroff, Dino Morea and Rahul Dev to present the awards. Art Alive Gallery will be showcasing a group show – Retrieval Systems – curated by Ranjit Hoskote along with five other contemporary Indian artists. The unique art collections are already on display at Visual Art Gallery from 19th November and will continue till 23rd November. The event will be shifted to Art Alive Galleryon 25th November. 'Retrieval Systems' brings together works by five contemporary artists namely,  Alex Fernandes B Manjunath Kamath Baiju Parthan G R Iranna and Tina Bopiah whose approach is based on the secreting of clues and patterns that add up to larger bodies of remembrance. 
<br /><br />The title of the exhibition borrowed its name from the information technology and indicates the electronic storage and access devices that extend our memory. Hoskote added, I would use the term retrieval systems to refer, metaphorically, to the archives of memory and reference that sustain the contemporary artistic imagination, which includes mainly the data that flows from the Net, mythology from various cultures, or the repertoires of art history. Among the five artists, Alex Fernandes works in the shifting terrain between portraiture and anthropology which presents a fascinating series of meta-portraits of Tiatristes – the performers who have kept alive one of Goa’s best-loved theatre forms. B Manjunath Kamath's sculpture-installation and digital composites presents archaeology of family and community memory from history but with his touch of humour. A multi-part photographic installation by Baiju Parthan describes the meditation on an Indo-Iberian monument that encrypts autobiographical resonances and explores the interplay of dream and memory. 
<br /><br />G R Iranna contributes three sculptural works to Retrieval Systems a maimed bell, a dissected boat, and a disarranged Buddha, re-configuring mythic resources and inherited symbolisms to interpret the present. The broken Buddha – Peace &amp; Pieces – spreads the message of peace I wanted to convey the message of peace and healing which we people have lost in this world shared G R Iranna. Lastly, Tina Bopiah has placed a suite of paintings which meditate on the gaps and bridges between fantasia and collective self-representation.

Red Carpet is the place where fresh skin and gorgeous makeup catch our attention while hairstyles ranging from up dos to half up and half owns to cascading curls and loose waves- all give us a reason to keep watching. Got no time to sit and watch them on the idiot box No worries we did just that and deciphered the red carpet hair and make-up trends for you. If you are really obsessed with the classy look go for unfussy up do pair it up with timeless makeup that had a touch of shimmer on the eyes and orange-red stained lips. It will also look flawless with highlighted cheeks soft smokey eyes and glossy rosy-pink lips. Diane Lane and Natalie Portman were seen flaunting theses killer looks in one of the recent award functions. If we are talking about up do then Freida Pinto never disappoints us. Walking at one of the red carpets we loved her hair that complemented her minimal makeup. Soft liner and shadow blush to add a bit of colour and a matte pink colour on the lip.
<br /><br />The very beautiful Jessica Biel was recently caught wearing a soft, wavy hairdo and kept her makeup only to her great skin neutral eyes and pink lips. With loosely curled tresses pulled half up Melissa George looked simply angelic and luminescent.

Amanda is one celebrity who has carried this off really well. 
<br /><br />Jennifer Anistons look is also referred by the fashionist as for inspiration. We love her cheery beach-worthy look completed perfectly with a French braid to hold the front of her hair back. Her makeup always complements her very dewy skin peachy-pink cheeks and light pink lips. Closer home Bipasha Basu and Priyanka Chopra are some of the hot favourites when it comes to setting the trends. Their smoky eyes first made popular by actress Sophia Loren is most the appropriate for night wear as it uses dark colours and looks less natural. Makeup is simple sheer and age-appropriate and hair style is classic funky and sophisticated completing the entire look.

Her foray into French fashion has won many accolades has added yet another first to her credentials by becoming the first Indian designer to be invited to participate at the much awaited fashion soiree, The Debutant Ball held annually at Paris. Find the designer herself in conversation with Stylekandy.com, Even when not showing elsewhere, why did you show at the Gitanjali Luxury Style fest in Dec 08 in Mumbai, almost a year before WIFW. Yeah…I did it, I felt that I should go ahead with it and hence just did it. No strategies involved the day and time suited me and so did it. Your show at WIFW was like a comeback show for you, what preparations did you have to make it grand. I will never call my show at WIFW as my comeback show because I never disappeared from the Indian fashion industry. I have no clues why everyone is naming it as my comeback show? Since my collection was inspiring and loads of hard work has gone in it, so over all the show was well presented and by God's grace it was a success. Bollywood incursion is often frivolous, how do you justify Abhay Deol walking the ramp with you? He was not my show stopper. For more information <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Beauty Tips</a> and beauty related product, Hair Color Tips for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbS9iZWF1dHlfaGFpci5hc3B4P3N0aWQ9OTM_" target="_blank">Hair Color Tips</a> and fashion deals online you can visit stylekandy.com
<br /><br />He walked because he is a good friend. But there really is no one like Abhay – he is so cool, so himself, totally relaxed, adventurous, young and presents a modern India. There's no one better I could have brought. With the height and body that you are blessed with, why do not you consider modelling your own clothes. Never ever did that thought cross my mind…I always wanted to be the creator and may be not the presenter. My inclination was more towards designing so…and now, it's too late. What was the thought behind the launch of Beri Baby collection? After my daughter's birth, I realized that in India kids wear is only constrained to ready-to-wear, so thought of coming out with a line of occasional wear dresses for the toddlers. You were the first Asian designer to head the French fashion brand, Scherrer and now again you are the first Indian designer to represent India at The Debutant ball, Le Ball held annually at Paris. How was the journey like. 
<br /><br />My journey can be defined as exciting with loads of hard work. It's not like I had a smooth path of success, even I saw those bad days which everyone tastes during their journey of life. I went through testing periods…but since I really wanted to make it big and grand so made it. My work has always been appreciated in Paris, already retailing through couple of stores there…so may be that why they chose me this year to be a part of Le Ball. Why did you choose Kashmiri princess, Adishree Singh to represent the gown designed by you at Le Ball.
<br /><br />My work always aims at presenting the Indian sensibility with a tint of modernity and urbaneness. I will be representing India and will make her look modern with some Indian touch. The sole focus is to retain modernity but still showcasing the real Indian fashion. Adishree will be presenting India in all its glory wearing a dramatic skirt and blouse. What is the design philosophy that you maintain while design? Fashion is eternal. The roots of fashion go deep into the yester years. Fashion can never be projected by restricting it to clothes. instead it should go beyond clothes to beauty, hair, footwear and other accessories. It reflects our personality, hence should be very comfortable and what you believe in. How would you describe the growth of the Indian fashion industry in the past decade.
<br /><br />Today, the Indian fashion industry has undergone a metamorphosis. People within and outside the fashion industry has started taking it as a serious profession. It has grown on a large scale and has achieved its recognition on the global platform too earlier India hardly had any fashion schools, but today parents are also eyeing this as a respected professional and hence encouraging their kids. The fashion bodies are also playing a great role, promoting emerging talents is a great task and on top of it, maintaining a consistency is also very pivotal. Do you think that the Indian fashion industry cannot work according to the 6 months projection time unlike the global fashion world? Indian fashion is specific to India and its seasonal cycles. We have a long summer and a very small period of winters so definitely, six month projection does not work that well with the Indian fashion industry. Future plans? For the time being it's only Le Ball at Paris, rest you will get to know about as things will start coming up.

The sari has now fast becoming a substitute for the Little Black Dress and amazing gowns. The six yard elegance which is considered to be an Indian woman's greatest asset has witnessed a drastic makeover since its inception. From contemporary to classic designer to embroidered machine to handmade sari has become one of the most versatile garments in the world. In modern times many a known designers have changed the look of a sari restricting it not just to a 5 1/2mt drape but making it as prettier as ever. For more information <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Beauty Tips</a> and beauty related product, Hair Color Tips for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdHlsZWthbmR5LmNvbS9iZWF1dHlfaGFpci5hc3B4P3N0aWQ9OTM_" target="_blank">Hair Color Tips</a> and fashion deals online you can visit stylekandy.com
<br /><br />Designers like Tarun Tahiliani and Nida Mahmood show cased the sari in new avatars at the recent Wills India Fashion Week. The sari according to them can be worn over a pair of jeans or jazzed up with a sexy slim belt for a trendy look. What's more young girls really liked these innovative styles. The designers have amazingly used Belts emphasizing on the waist adding more sexiness style and youthfulness to the entire personality. This idea of wearing saris over jeans is the interpretation of wearing a sari in a trendy manner. This is a trend that youngsters can follow for any casual party. It looks very chic and innovative especially if you are carrying the outfit with the right kind of accessories and look. Swarovski clad saris are also one of the recent trend setters as we have seen several designers using it on the runway.
<br /><br />Satya Paul the designer who is known for experimenting beautifully with this 6 feet drapes in 2007 showed a line of saris the Trouser Sari a pre- pleated sari with a trouser underneath. Since then designers like Anamika Khanna Sabyasachi Wendell Rod ricks Meera and Muzaffar Ali and Ravi Bajaj have all done their interpretations of sari. Sometimes edgy and trendy and sometimes easy- to- wear and comfortable the sari has transformed into many new avatars. Anamika Khanna in her Sari Spring Summer 2010 invented sari pyjamas where she used crushed muslin fabric combining the sari drape with casual pyjamas which filled in for petticoats. The sari is pleated around the right leg with a knotted pallu thrown casually over the shoulder. Next comes Sabyasachi whose chhotu saris or cropped saris as a part of his Fall-Winter 2009 collection were the ones that ended just before the ankle. The sari does not need to be pleated as it has ruches in the front and was totally dedicated to those who were weak in draping. 
<br /><br />Menswear designer Ravi Bajaj at one of his shows in Los Angeles showcased Poncho Saris in 2009. There he made this six yard wonder more user-friendly by mixing it with traditional Japanese design. The sari which was made has a pleated skirt a neckline in the pallu which goes through the head and falls back over the shoulder giving it an effect of a poncho gown cum sari. Jai-Parvesh and Hemant-Nandita the designer duos swear by pre-pleated and lehenga saris which are easy to wear and carry at the same time. While pre-pleated saris are like skirts with pleats stitched on to them lehenga saris have a flowing silhouette below and has a heavy pallu replacing a well-draped dupatta on the left shoulder. On the international ramp the sari got its first push towards stardom when Valentino designed a sari dress for Jackie O way back in the 50s. Back in the '80s Zandra Rhodes the British fashion house took the sari and put zippers on it and combined it with a Victorian crinoline skirt. In another design she cut holes in the pallu for the arms to go through and the sari was draped over the head like a veil. In 2008, Jean Paul Gaultier designing for Hermes showed a line of sari dresses in his spring summer collection which was greatly appreciated by the Western market followed by a spring- summer line for Etro who showcased sari overalls or one piece jumpsuits with the sari drape. Freida Pinto who chose to wear a blue John Gallianosari-inspired gown with exquisite net detailing or Tina Fey hosting the show in a silver gown whose drapes took off from the Indian garment. So whether it is Jumpsuit kimono or poncho sari these classic six- yards drape is getting a twist that you can love or hate but can not ignore.

		<document id="6b5ff794dc094734b09cffda6b0510b3" url=""><![CDATA[Planning Online Fashion Marketing<br/><br/>It’s natural progression says Vikram Raizada who has decided to move on from his much coveted designation of Head Fashion at IMG. The news first started percolating in during the recently concluded Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. The grapevine was at work and it was pretty much the talk of the town then, even though Delhi is not where Vikram belongs to. However, it was official yesterday morning when IMG and Vikram decided to announce the handover of the reigns into the hands of Sujal Shah. Sujal is not new in town. He has previously served as Senior Advisor to IMG for LFW Spring/Summer 2010 and seemed as IMG’s best bet to replace Vikram as the Head of Fashion for IMG, India. He will be reporting to Ravi Krishnan, Managing Director IMG South Asia.
<br /><br />I am excited. I am not trying to step into anyone’s shoes, even though I may be expected to do so. The way I see it, I simply need to pick up from where Vikram has left and take it where he and IMG would like it to be, Sujal chose his words with caution, perhaps reflective of the fact that he holds an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.S. from Georgetown University. 
<br />Vikram meanwhile seems to have moved on for better pastures, although the man asserts that there is no real reason for the handover and he leaves us with no real reason to suspect his genuineness either. However, ask him where his next stint would be and I will continue to serve the lifestyle sector is all that he has to offer, but not before a promise of letting us know the finer details in early Jan next year. You must understand, I am still serving notice here (at IMG), it’s not a part of my allegiance to this wonderful workplace to talk about another employer just yet, said Vikram who still shares cordial rapports with MTV India where he served seven years and with the Murjani Group where he launched major brands for two years before settling in at IMG.
<br /><br />He was all praises for Sujal, who returned the favour by stating, It’s been a smooth transition until now, with Vikram around, it was always expected. One attribute that you score better in over Vikram? “None, the man is perfect! But I love partying, so you might just end up bumping into me more often that you ever did with him, chuckles the man who has been the Head of Strategy and Planning at Brand Marketing India and has ideated processes for international brands such as Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Bottega Venetta, Calvin Klein, French Connection and Tommy Hilfiger prior to his association with IMG. Ravi Krishnan, Managing Director IMG South Asia said, &quot;Sujal’s extensive experience and strong relationships at both international and national level will enable the company developing LFW whilst exploring new opportunities.

He is one guy who has been shuffling between hits and misses and doing so at both ends of the spectrum. One thing that he never misses though is generating hype for any of his forthcoming ventures. Another quality that sets him apart is his passion for fashion. Be it walking for good friend Arjun Khanna totally clad in gold or sashaying down the runway for Karan Johar and Varun Bahl with Imran khan or launching his line of tees for Provogue Ranbir’s tryst with fashion has surged without ebbing. With Rocket Singh having bombed at the Box Office one would imagine that his spirits may have been dampened to death. His performance may have been appreciated but the film as a product does not seem to rework the magic of Bachna Ae Haseeno or Ajab Prem ki. But Ranbir chooses to remain on a high note Being the hero, I am just the face of the product who is supporting the idea of the writer and the director. Ranbir is just four films old but has already become one of the most sought after men in the B-town and he thinks he still needs to prove his worth. Well I am approached by the directors for representing their character. Getting an opportunity does not mean that all my films have to be a hit. I sincerely love to portray the character the way it has to be painted in collaboration with the script and the director. Sincerely it’s them the audiences and you guys that have to answer that question for me. Modest as he may sound sexy he sure is. This was proven when last week the People’s magazine rated him above John Abraham SRK, Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan to become the sexiest man in India. Ask him which part of his body does he find the sexiest and he offers his immodest best self. Everything my eyes are sexy my lips are sexy my hair are sexy my butt is sexy just about everything man.
<br /><br />The Kapoor lad is well aware of the fact that he has acquired the status of a gay icon. May be Karan should have cast me in Dostaana in whose character, Abhishek’s or John’s we ask None he should have carved another role for me. We three would have rocked the gay man’s world! Well that sounds quite a possibility now because Karan is looking at roping in John and Ranbir as the face of his fashion line with designer Varun Bahl. Who knows Abhishek could be next. Talking about his fashion fetish the guy says Arjun is a close friend and so is Karan. It was like walking for a family member. Please do not ask me to choose between the two because they both have eclectic design sensibilities. Fashion for me is the way you carry yourself. Seriously it is more about attitude than clothes ask me. I am the most comfy in jeans and tees and I think I look good in them too.
<br /><br />Today is the 85th birth anniversary of his grandfather Raj Kapoor often referred to as the Showman of the Hindi Film Industry. Dad and uncle are launching a book titled The Dialogue of Awaara Raj Kapoor's Immortal Classic which will contain the famous dialogues of dadaji’s classics and hits. I am a part of the launch as well. There is a lot to learn from him and his work even now. His expertise was beyond time it still holds contemporary relevance. Known for his fitness and supple dance moves Ranbir is perhaps the fittest in the Kapoor clan. Recently he launched the dance academy by Bosco-Cesar at Leena Mogre’s Fitness in Mumbai. Bosco and I really hit off well during wake up sid. I love dancing had I not been a hero I would have been a professional dancer who would not mind dancing behind the hero! And to be able to pull off any role you have to be mentally and physically fit. I eat everything and workout to burn those extra calories. I am blessed with a high metabolism at least until now. Hailing from a family that is supposedly nose deep in riches Ranbir maintains a rather middle class approach. We have heard Neetu Singh Kapoor saying that Ranbir is very choosy and he does not like to spend money on things easily? Well she is my mom after all I am perfect for her. But yes, I take a little longer to choose things. In fact I am the earning member of the family and I do not like to waste money irresponsibly signs off the star.

<br /><br />If your party requires a tuxedo, the best bet will be the classic black and white combination. Make sure your suit fits and looks perfect. The 70s inspired a sharply cut three-piece suit from Versace and Armani Collezioni will definitely bring the spot light on you. Opt for minimum colours and accessorize it with a nice tie. Plaid ties in shades of purple and cherry look great. So get ready and remember to always look and feel like a million bucks. It’s the season to party and celebrate.
