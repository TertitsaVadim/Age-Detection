It is considered sacred by Hindus and its snow deposition pattern is said to resemble the Hindu sacred syllable 'AUM' (?). Its appearance is distinctly similar to Mount Kailash in Tibet. Near Om Parvat lie Parvati Lake and Jonglingkong Lake. Jonglingkong Lake is sacred, as Mansarovar, to the Hindus. Opposite to this peak is a mountain called Parwati Muhar, whose snow shines like a crown in the sun.

As a daily routine here are a few steps to follow to have a painless back. Anyone who has had a back ache will tell you how it affects every aspect of your life ranging from a mild discomfort to sending you to a few days bed rest.
<br /><br />Taking care of your back
<br />The back extends from your neck down to your hips.  It lends support to many structures and organs on its way ranging from the ribs  to the pelvis.  The back is formed by bones called vertebrae which are placed one on top of another to form the spine also called the spinal column or spinal chord.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_8121615_49989166.jpg" />
<br /><br />There are many causes of back aches and most of them can be prevented by precautions while others are serious and need a visit to the doctor. Here are 10 general tips you can follow to keep in good shape. 
<br /><br /><strong>1.	Pay attention to your posture:</strong> 
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_7255119_49989189.jpg" />
<br /><br />This cannot be said enough. Slouching, sitting on sofas which do not offer firm support to the back and sleeping in an awkward position may give you a stiff back the next morning. Reclining in a chair without support to the lower back in the form of a cushion is a no-no. Sleeping on the side in the foetal position is the best way to take the pressure off a weak back.
<br /><br /><strong>2.	Maintain optimum weight:</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_16159289_49989209.jpg" />
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_15841468_49989216.jpg" />
<br /><br />When you put on more weight than your frame can carry, you put pressure on the muscles of the back and abdomen which were not designed to be overloaded. This kind of backache is simply the muscles protesting against the added burden.
<br /><br /><strong>3.	Avoid direct pressure on the spine:</strong>
<br /><br />When someone other than a professional offers to give you a back massage they may put pressure directly over the spine. This is a wrong technique and may further compound the problem. The best way is to massage on both sides of the spine in a symmetrical fashion with circular motions.
<br /><br /><strong>4.	Be active and on the move:</strong>
<br /><br />Being in any one posture for long intervals of time causes a sore back. If you have a desk job, make sure you walk during your coffee and lunch breaks. This improves your blood circulation and uses the muscles to an extent.
<br /><br /><strong> 5.	Bend correctly:</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_15124525_49989493.jpg" />
<br /><br />While bending, one must remember not to bend from the waist but from the knees keeping the back straight as far as possible. This is especially important while lifting luggage or heavy items.
<br /><br /><strong>6.	Increase exercise reps slowly and steadily:</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>7.	For an acute backache:</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_13749221_49989512.jpg" />
<br /><br />Put up your feet and get some rest. Use ice packs a few times a day for the first two days, then switch over to heat in the form of hot compresses or a hot water bag.
<br /><br /><strong>8.	Stretch a sore back:</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_9578993_49989519.jpg" />
<br /><br />Stretching is a great way to relieve backache. While lying flat on the bed, bring your knees slowly to your chest and put a little pressure then relax and repeat. This is helpful for lower back pain. Doctor advised me do this rocking on all fours pose(yoga) pose for my lower back pain after my kids were born.
<br /><br /><strong>9.	Get out of bed right:</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_14953262_49989538.jpg" />
<br /><br />When the alarm clock rings every morning the first thought is to hurry out of bed. Resist the thought and take your time. First roll over to the edge of the bed and lie flat on your back. Then bring your feet down to the floor and bend your upper body sideways. Do not get up vertically and sit in bed as that puts a lot of pressure on the back. I was advised by the doctor to get up this way. 
<br /><br /><strong>10.	Medication:</strong>
<br /><br />An aspirin a day can help chronic backaches, which last for days together due to their anti-inflammatory effect. An alternative is ibuprofen or another NSAID. Before starting on medication, check with your doctor first. I prefer to apply some ointment rather than taking pills unless absolutely necessary.
<br /><br /><strong> Bonus tip! Join a yoga or t’ai chi class</strong>
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_7798903_49989562.jpg" />
<br /><br />he stretches in yoga and t’ai chi when done correctly will strengthen back muscles so make sure you find a good instructor for whatever you choose to follow. Backache will be a thing of the past. Meditation also relaxes you .

<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_2717971_49997549.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />This relationship is no where so celebrated as it is celebrated in India. A festival which celebrates the bond of affection between brothers and sisters where siblings pray for each others' well being and wish for each others' happiness and goodwill.
<br /><br />The name 'Raksha Bandhan' suggests 'a bond of protection'. On this auspicious day, brothers make a promise to their sisters to protect them from all harms and troubles and the sisters pray to God to protect their brother from all evil. The festival falls on the Shravan Purnima ( full moon of august) which comes generally in the month of August. Sisters tie the silk thread called Rakhi on their brother's wrist and pray for their well being and brothers promise to take care of their sisters.
<br /><br /><strong>The Significance</strong>
<br /><br />Raksha Bandhan is now considered as a day to celebrate the sacred relation of a brother and a sister. Yet there have been examples in history where in rakhi has just been a raksha or protection. It could be tied by wife, a daughter or mother. The Rishis tied rakhi to the people who came seeking their blessings. The sages tied the sacred thread to themselves to safe guard them from the evil. It is by all means the 'Papa Todak, Punya Pradayak Parva' or the day that bestows boons and end all sins as it is mentioned in the scriptures.
<br /><br />The different ways, in which the custom of Rakhi is followed today, shows the continued relevance of Raksha Bandhan in today's world.
<br /><br />An incident is from the epic Mahabharata concerns Krishna and Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas. She had once torn a strip of silk off her sari and tied it around Krishna's wrist to staunch the bleeding from a battlefield wound. Krishna was touched by her action and declared her to be his sister, even though they were unrelated. He promised to repay the debt and then spent the next 25 years doing just that. 
<br /><br /><strong> In history there are examples of </strong>:- 
<br /><br />Alexander: When Alexander invaded the Indian subcontinent in 326 B.C. he had to fight many battles against the rulers of kingdoms in the north West. Alexander's wife is believed to have tied a Rakhi to the king Puru or Porus. In return he is believed to have promised to protect her and her husband. In battle when he had the opportunity to strike Alexander, his promise is believed to have restrained him from delivering a fatal blow.
<br /><br />Humayun: During Mughal times the custom of tying Rakhis helped bind the Hindu Rajputs and the Mughal rulers of Delhi together. According to legend, when Bahadur Shah of Gujarat attacked Rani Karnavati of Chittor in 1535, she sent a Rakhi to Humayun and requested him to help. He tried to come to her aid but was too late, Chittor had already fallen and the Rani had immolated herself in the Rajput custom of Jauhar.
<br /><br />Previously, Rakhi festival encompasses the warmth shared between the siblings but now it goes way beyond it.
<br /><br />Women send Rakhis to the Army, navy and Air Force Personals.
<br /><br />Some people tie Rakhi to neighbours and close friends signifying a peaceful co-existence of every individual.
<br /><br /><strong>Popularity</strong>
<br /><br />Rakhi Utsav was first popularized by Rabindranath Tagore to promote the feeling of unity and a commitment to all members of society to protect each other and encourage a harmonious Social life. In present day times, women have used the tradition of Rakhi as a way of deflecting unwanted attention and some women politicians have maintained political relationships with other leaders, by tying Rakhis on them. 
<br /><br />In today's scenario, the day has a different perspective. The occasion involves a pledge of life-time practice of moral, cultural and spiritual values.
<br /><br />The values and the sentiments attached to the rituals of this festival are worth inculcating by the whole human race, the sentiments of harmony and peaceful coexistence.
<br /><br />The festival of Raksha Bandhan assumes all forms of Raksha or protection, of righteousness and destroyer of all sin. The ritual of Rakhi tying has become so important that come what may, brothers and sisters try to visit each other's place on this particular day in order to bring back the oneness of the family, binding the family together in an emotional bond of love.
<br /><br />The festival of Raksha Bandhan falls tomorrow i.e. Thursday 2nd August 2012. I wish all a Happy Raksha Bandhan.

<br /><br />VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
<br /><br />Bank ATM's Converted to Steal IDs of Bank Customers
<br /><br />A team of organized criminals are installing equipment on legitimate bank ATM's in at least 2 regions to steal both the ATM card number and the PIN. The team sits nearby in a car receiving the information transmitted wirelessly over weekends and evenings from equipment they install on the front of the ATM (see photos). If you see an attachment like this, do not use the ATM and report it immediately to the bank using the phone on the front of the ATM. The equipment used to capture your ATM card number and PIN are cleverly disguised to look like normal ATM equipment. A &quot;skimmer&quot; is mounted to the front of the normal ATM card slot that reads the ATM card number and transmits it to the criminals sitting in a nearby car. At the same time, a wireless camera is disguised to look like a leaflet holder and is mounted in a position to view ATM PIN entries. The thieves copy the cards and use the PIN numbers to withdraw thousands from many accounts in a very short time directly from the bank ATM.

<br /><br />Have you ever tried smiling at someone crossing your path, while walking along the street? Or have you smiled back at someone whom you’ve never met before? Whether you know that person or not, the tendency is that they will smile back.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_2573787_50228030.jpg" />
<br /><br />Some say smiling, like yawning, is contagious. Is there any truth to this? Well, there are several explanations behind this phenomenon.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_7788170_50228039.jpg" />
<br /><br />- Smiling is a form of greeting. And as responsive creatures, people react in an equal and similar manner. They smile back.
<br /><br />· When you smile at someone, you fulfill their need for acknowledgement, friendship. And smiling back can be a form of gratitude.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_13096362_50228051.jpg" />
<br /><br />-It is already a universal fact that positive attracts positive. When you smile at someone, you give off positive emotions, which pull at the same energies in the receiving person. Likewise, negative energy attracts negative energy. Have you ever tried frowning at someone? Hopefully, the worst response you get is a frown, too.
<br /><br />- If you want to put it Biblically, “what you reap is what you sow”. No brainer here.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_16103066_50228058.jpg" />
<br /><br />So, whatever the reason why you’re doing it, just go ahead and spread the happy bug. Smile at the people you meet and be rewarded not just with toothy grins, but with new acquaintances and renewed friendships.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_9955613_50228064.jpg" />
<br /><br />And even if the people you smile at don’t return it, just keep on doing it. Research says that smiling lifts the spirits and keeps you young. Now isn’t that reason enough to continue smiling ?

<br /><br />There are many questions on sleep, the answers of which we need to know. How much sleep does a person require daily?Why should we sleep?When should we sleep etc. People have had lots of misconceptions and there are many myths in this regard too. Sleep is very important for us to carry out our day to day functioning.
<br /><br /><strong>1. The Power of Sleep</strong>
<br /><br />We all feel that we have better things to do than sleep. But the truth is that to do things better, you need to rest (sleep). While you rest, your brain stays busy, overseeing a wide variety of biological maintenance functions that keep you running in top condition. Without enough hours of restorative sleep, you’re like a stereo that needs fixing. If you skip your required dosage of sleep every day, you will head for a physical and mental breakdown.
<br /><br /><strong>2. When to sleep</strong>
<br /><br />Some of us think that the lack of sleep at night can be made up by sleeping during the day. Butsleeping during the day and staying awake at night is not how your body is designed to function. As per biology, at night, your body responds to the loss of daylight by producing melatonin - a hormone that makes you sleepy. During the day, sunlight triggers the brain to stop melatonin production so you feel awake and alert. In case you prefer to stay awake at night, we advise you to pay heed to this information and change your sleep schedule.
<br /><br /><strong>3. How much sleep do you need daily?</strong>
<br /><br />7.5 hours – 9 hours. This is the number of hours that adults must spend sleeping every night. The reason why this number is important is because the brain relaxes your body while you sleep. If you sleep any less, the brain cannot complete its night time duties and as a result you are not able to give your best
<br />during the day. No matter how tight your schedule is, do try to get the minimum amount of sleep. We have given you enough gyaan on sleep and it's merits. Hope you give sleep the importance it deserves and spend sufficient time in bed Sleeping. 
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Important</strong></span>
<br /><br />If you’re not of the rare breed that worries about hours wasted while snoozing, you do love your daily dose of slumber. Perhaps you even look forward to it with unnatural enthusiasm. If so, you’re doing it right. Apart from being the most relaxing end to a long day, sleeping also has multiple health benefits. 
<br /><br /><strong>Top 8 health benefits of sleep</strong>
<br /><br />1.       <strong>Reduces stress:</strong> In the case of sleep deficiency, the body’s functions enter a state of high alert. This causes an increase in blood pressure and production of stress hormones. The stress hormones make it harder to sleep and the higher blood pressure amplifies the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
<br /><br />2.      <strong>Boosts memory: </strong>During the time you’re asleep, the brain processes any new knowledge, organises the skills learned while you were awake, makes connections between events, feelings and memories, and sensory input. This helps you toprocess information and perform better.
<br /><br />3.      <strong> Healthier heart:</strong> A lack of sleep is often associated with increased blood pressure and cholesterol – factors directly responsible for heart ailments and strokes. Seven to eight hours of sleep will go a long way in promoting cardiovascular health.
<br /><br />4.      <strong> Lowers inflammation:</strong> One of the most important benefits of sleep is that it helps to keep stress hormone levels in check. This allows the body to alleviate the levels of inflammation, which is known to increase the risk of heart-related diseases, premature aging, arthritis, cancer and diabetes.
<br /><br />5.      <strong>Allows body repairs:</strong> The cells in the body produce more protein while you’re asleep, which aids the body in recovering from damage caused by stress, ultraviolet radiation, and other harmful exposures.
<br /><br />6.      <strong> Lowers risk of depression:</strong> Sleep has an impact on several chemicals in the body, including serotonin, which causes depression among those people if there is a deficiency. The right amount of sleep, close to 7 to 8 hours, can prevent the onset of depression by producing enough serotonin.
<br /><br />7.      <strong>Weight management:</strong> Lack of sleep may lead to an imbalance of the ghrelin and leptin hormones, which are crucial in regulating appetite. Additionally, the same part of the brain that controls sleep also increases metabolism. So to maintain or control weight, it is imperative to get adequate sleep.
<br /><br />8.      <strong>Higher alertness levels:</strong> It follows logically that a good night’s sleep leads to more energy and alertness the next morning. This prepares the body for a day’s worth of activity and engagement, and increases the likelihood of another good night’s sleep. It’s a good circle to be caught in.

<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_2460250_50307341.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />Aamir Khan's hugely successful TV show &quot;Satyamev Jayate&quot;, that focusing on burning issues facing India and ways of tackling them, has landed him on the cover of prestigious Time magazine as India's &quot;first superstar-activist.&quot;
<br />&quot;He's breaking the Bollywood mold by tackling India's social evils. Can one actor change a nation?&quot; asks the blurb on the cover of the Asia edition of the Sep 10 issue of the US magazine, which features a close-up of the actor looking intensely into the camera.
<br />Tracing the rise of Aamir Khan with the 1988 blockbuster hit &quot;Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak&quot;, Time's Bobby Ghosh noted over the past decade the 47-year-old actor has acted in, directed and produced a string of &quot;movies that artfully straddle the demands of popular cinema and that desire for grace.&quot;
<br />&quot;Now, with his groundbreaking TV show Satyamev Jayate (Truth Alone Prevails), he has dispensed with commercial considerations to indulge his conscience,&quot; writes Ghosh. &quot;With it, Khan has taken on the mantle of the country's first superstar-activist.&quot;
<br />&quot;The show, in equal parts chat and journalism, casts an unblinking spotlight on some of India's ugliest social problems,&quot; he says of the show of which Khan is &quot;creator, producer and host, and he has invested it with his star power - and his credibility.&quot;
<br />&quot;It's a ballsy move, and potentially jeopardizes his status as the beloved idol of millions,&quot; writes Ghosh, since the subjects his show tackles &quot;are precisely the sorts of harsh realities from which many of Khan's fans seek escape in his movies.&quot;
<br />&quot;Can a movie star affect the mores of a nation of 1.2 billion?&quot; asks Ghosh and suggests &quot;It might just be possible in India, where a national obsession with cinema, unparalleled in the world, gives popular actors an influence beyond the imagination of Hollywood scriptwriters.&quot;
<br />As Khan assesses the impact of his first series, Time suggests, &quot;Whatever Khan chooses to do next in his quest for grace, there's a good chance it will lift India a little closer to what he - and fellow Indians - would wish their country and society to be.&quot;
<br />Aamir Khan is the third Indian actor to be featured on the cover of Time magazine. Aishwarya Rai made it to the cover in 2003 and Parveen Babi was featured in 1976.

<br /><br />Mr. Bean( Rowin Atkinson) is doing the Bhangra which is a folk dance from the Punjab. The dance is to the song 'Hauli Nach' by? Lehmber Hussainpuri.
<br /><br />The earliest developed of this dance form was a folk dance conducted by Punjabis in the central northern areas of the sub continent region to celebrate any occasion, but more so during the harvest season called Bisakhi. Earliest records of this folk dance is from way back in 1880. Since it is associated with Punjabis and Sikhs, it lost its aura after partition in 1947 from the west punjab region as that area went to Pakistan and the Sikhs and Hindu Punjabis migrated to the Eastern Punjab region which came to India.
<br /><br />The Bhangra is done by men and women or only men whereas another dance form called Giddha is done by women only.
<br /><br />In the 1950s, a new folkloric dance, representative of the state of Punjab and composed of glimpses of men's Punjabi dance styles, was created and eventually received the title of bhangra. First developed in India and attaining a rather standardized form by the 1980s, the folkloric bhangra was exported to other counties by Punjabi emigrants. By the 1990s, a still newer style of dance called bhangra was being staged in the Punjabi Diaspora, often characterized by a fusion with Western dance styles and the use of prerecorded audio mixes. Aside from these specific dance genres, Punjabi dancing in general, especially when done to popular bhangra music, is often casually called &quot;bhangra.
<br /><br /><strong>Musical accompaniment</strong>
<br /><br />Bhangra dance is based on music from a dhol, folk singing, and the chimta. The accompanying songs are small couplets written in the Punjabi language called bolis.
<br /><br />Bhangra singers employ a high, energetic tone of voice. Singing fiercely and with great pride, they typically add nonsensical, random noises to their singing. Likewise, often people dancing to Bhangra will yell phrases such as hoi, hoi, hoi; balle balle; chak de; oye hoi; bruah (for an extended length of about 2–5 seconds); haripa; or ch-ch (mostly used as slow beats called Jhummar) to the music.

<br /><br />Traditional men wear a chaadra while doing bhangra. A chaadra is a piece of cloth wrapped around the waist. Men also wear a kurta, which is a long shirt. In addition, men wear pagri (turban) to cover their heads.
<br /><br />In modern times, men also wear turla, the fan attached to the pagri. Colorful vests are worn above the kurta. Phummans (small balls attached to ropes) are worn on each arm.
<br /><br />Women wear a traditional Punjabi dress known as a salwar kameez, long baggy pants tight at the ankle (salwar) and a long colorful shirt (kameez). Women also wear chunnis, colorful pieces of cloth wrapped around the neck.
<br /><br />These items are all very colorful and vibrant, representing the rich rural colors of Punjab.[3] Besides the above, the bhangra dress has different parts that are listed below in detail:-
<br /><br />Pag (turban, a sign of pride/honor in the Punjab ). This is tied differently than the traditional turban one sees Sikhs wearing in the street. This turban has to be tied before each show.
<br />Kurta, similar to a silk shirt, with about four buttons, very loose with embroidered patterns
<br />Lungi or chadar, a loose loincloth tied around the dancer's waist, which is usually very decorated
<br />Jugi, a waistcoat with no buttons
<br />Rum?l, small &quot;scarves&quot; worn on the fingers. They look very elegant and are effective when the hands move during the course of bhangra performance.

<br /><br />The body of a perfectly preserved, carefully mummified alien was found buried in an ancient pyramid. A mysterious creature from between 150 and 160 centimeters was found by an archaeologist near Lahun when exploring a small pyramid near the Dynasty doceaba of Senusret II. However, this fact was not revealed immediately. “The mummy of what appears to be an alien, dates back more than 2000 years and it seems it would be a humanoid” said a source at the Egyptian Antiquities Department, who provided details and photographs of the find but did so under condition anonymity. “
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_15289047_50549064.jpg" />
<br /><br />These remains like an alien strangers have created much controversy in the world.
<br /><br />Some online sources said that this is a species-being for its fur and reptilian traits that characterize them, such as their eyes, too large and oval shaped. Inscriptions on the tomb of the mummy showed that the king was a counselor named Osirunet, meaning star or sent from heaven. ” The mummified body was buried with great respect and care, accompanied by a number of strange objects far from the archaeological museum managers can not identify.
<br />According to Egyptian sources, the alien mummy was discovered by Dr. Viktor Lubek, Czechoslovakian citizen and retired professor of the University of Pennsylvania. Archaeologist located the hidden compartment while conducting an investigation into a small pyramid south of the main pyramid, Senusret II, which contains the queen of the pharaoh. At the site also found some gold and clay mixtures covering the body, and traces of cloth linen like appearance, the skin covering the enigmatic being.
<br /><br />Objects containing the tomb include artifacts made of a synthetic type resist that nobody could identify. No one has found similar elements in other Egyptian tombs, so the discovery would greatly importanca for current archeology.
<br /><br />The anonymous messenger which has obtained the information, also said that the discovery has caused great consternation among Egyptian officials, who want to keep it hidden until a plausible explanation for the strange mummy. The government has consulted a number of respected archaeologists, but to date none can explain the finding in ordinary terms.
<br /><br />“The truth is, that every expert who has seen the mummy have concluded that it is not of earthly origin,” said the source. “There is a sense that this is an alien who somehow ended up advising an Egyptian king.” But everyone in the government is moving away from that conclusion that would support the new ideas that the ancient Egyptians had help from aliens in building their extraordinary civilization. “The Egyptians refuse to believe that their heritage came from outer space.”

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_16105341_50553917.jpg" />
<br /><br />A former NASA astronaut who has walked on the moon has said aliens are not only real but have visited Earth several times.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Dr Edgar Mitchell, said he was aware of several UFO visits during his career, but each one had been covered up.</strong></span>
<br /><br />The 77-year-old, who was a crew member of the Apollo 14 mission, said sources at the space agency had described aliens as resembling &quot;little people who look strange to us&quot;.
<br /><br />Dr Mitchell told Kerrang! Radio that human technology was &quot;not nearly as sophisticated&quot; as theirs and had they been hostile, he warned: &quot;We would be been gone by now&quot;.
<br /><br />He said: &quot;There's not much question at all that there's life throughout the universe, we are not alone at all. I'm most assured about that.
<br /><br />&quot;Have we been able to identify where the other planets are?
<br /><br />No, certainly not in our Solar System but we have been able to identify quite a number of planets that could be life bearing planets.
<br /><br />&quot;I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we've been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomena is real.
<br /><br />&quot;It's been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so, but slowly it's leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it.
<br /><br />&quot;I've been in military and intelligence circles, who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge, yes – we have been visited.
<br /><br />&quot;Reading the papers recently, it's been happening quite a bit.&quot;
<br /><br />Dr Mitchell, along with Apollo 14 Commander Alan Shepard, still holds the record for the longest ever moonwalking session at nine hours and 17 minutes following their 1971 mission.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Officials from NASA, were quick to play the comments down.</span>
<br /><br />In a statement, a spokesman said: &quot;NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe.
<br /><br />&quot;Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.&quot;

<br /><br />A psychological delusion whereby most Earthlings absurdly believe that they are either the most advanced lifeforms in the Universe or the only lifeforms in the Universe! The term also denotes a related delusion whereby most Earthlings absurdly believe that the conditions required for life on Earth must be the same conditions required for life on other planets—a lame assumption that is categorically false. However, the arrogance, egotism, and stupidity of the average Earthling can be humorously tolerated and excused for a race of beings who not too long ago believed the Earth was flat and the center of the Universe!

<br /><br />This is an article worth reflecting upon... shared by one of my best friends..
<br /><br />LIFETIME EXPERIENCE: Article in ET of 16/11/2007 By Devdutt Pattanaik:
<br /><br /><strong>1.From the great epics</strong> 
<br /><br />IN BOTH THE GREAT epics of India, Ramayan and Mahabharata, war ends not with celebration of victory but with transmission of knowledge.
<br /><br /><strong>Ramayana</strong>
<br /><br />In the Ramayan, Ravan lies mortally wounded on the battlefield and the monkeys are celebrating their victory, when Ram turns to his brother, Lakshman,and says, “While Ravan was a brute, he was also a great scholar. Go to him quickly and request himto share whatever knowledge he can.”
<br /> The obedient Lakshman rushes to Ravan’s side and whispers in his ears, “Demonking, all your life you have taken not given. Now the noble Ram gives you an opportunity to mend your ways. Share your vast wisdom. Do not let it die with you. For that you will be surely be blessed.”
<br /><br />Ravan responds by simply turning away. An angry Lakshman goes back to Ram and says: “He is as arrogant as he always was, too proud to share anything.” Ram looks at his brother and asks him softly, “Where did you stand while asking him for knowledge?” “Next to his head so that I hear what he had to say clearly.” Ram smiles, places his bow on the ground and walks to where Ravan lies. Lakshman watches in astonishment as his brother kneels at Ravan’ s feet.
<br /><br />With palms joined, with extreme humility, Ram says, “Lord of Lanka, you abducted my wife, a terrible crime for which I have been forced to punish you. Now, you are no more my enemy. I see you now as you are known across the world, as the wise son of Rishi Vishrava. I bow to you and request you to share your wisdom with me. Please do that for if you die without doing so, all your wisdom will be lost forever to the world.”
<br /><br />To Lakshman’s surprise, Ravan opens his eyes and raises his arms to salute Ram, “If only I had more time as your teacher than as your enemy. Standing at my feet as a student should, unlike your rude younger brother, you are a worthy recipient of my knowledge. I have very little time so I cannot share much but let me tell you one important lesson I have learnt in my life. Things that are bad for you seduce you easily; you run towards them impatiently. But things are actually good for you fail to attract you; you shun them creatively, finding powerful excuses to justify your procrastination. That is why I was impatient to abduct Sita but avoided meeting you. This is the wisdom of my life, Ram. My last words. I give it to you.” With these words, Ravan dies.
<br /><br /><strong> Mahabharat</strong>
<br /><br />There’s similar knowledge transmission after the Mahabharat war is over and the Kauravas are all dead. As the victorious Pandavas are about to assume control of Hastinapur, Krishna advises them to talk to Bhisma, their grand uncle, who lies mortally wounded on the battlefield. As a result of a blessing, death would elude him for some time. “Make him talk until his last breath. Ask him Questions. He has a lot to tell,” says Krishna.
<br /><br />Sure enough, when prompted, the dying Bhisma spends hours discussing various topics: history,geography, politics, economics, management, war, ethics, morality, sex, astronomy, metaphysics and spirituality. Bhisma’s discourse is captured in the Shanti Parva (discussions of peace) and Anushasan Parva (discussions on discipline) that makes up a quarter of the Mahabharata. After listening to their grandsire, the Pandavas have a better understanding of the world, and this makes them better kings.
<br /><br /><strong> 2. In the present context </strong>
<br /><br />Long has this knowledge drain been recognised. Over the past decade, a whole new business process known as knowledge management has evolved that seeks to harness, store, transmit this knowledge. Every CEO agrees that it is a valuable business process, that investment in it is critical.Policies have been made, people have been hired and systems have been deployed. Unfortunately, for all the initial enthusiasm, implementation has been lacking. Unlike retrieving cash, retrieving knowledge from employees, both current and future, is not easy. Often  because they are like Sahadeva.
<br /><br /><strong> Who was Sahadeva and what was his problem</strong>
<br /><br />Sahadeva was the youngest Pandava and, in the South Indian Mahabharata, he is described as an expert in many predictive sciences such as astrology, palmistry and face reading. But he is cursed: if he ever gave any information voluntarily, his head will split into a thousand pieces. That is why he is silent throughout the epic. He knows every fortune and misfortune that his family will go through, but he can never use his knowledge to forewarn anyone. When Yudhishtira finally learns of his brother’s prowess he is furious. “Why did you not tell me all that you knew?” All he gets in response is Sahadeva’s silence.
<br />Most employees in an organisation are Sahadevas.
<br /><br /><strong>3. Most company (Sahadevas) are of two types:</strong>
<br /><br />i.  Either they are unwilling to share their knowledge or,
<br />ii. they don’t have the means to do so.
<br /><br />The former category knows that knowledge is power and will not give it away under any circumstances. The latter category is willing to share knowledge but either no one asks them for it or there is no system where they can make it available for others.
<br /><br /><strong>4.  Knowledge Management</strong>
<br /><br />Knowledge Management is leadership driven. Only a Ram, not a Laskhman can do it. He must first believe in it. He must respect the fact that everyone in his organisation, even those who he does not particularly like, are repositories of great wisdom – not only knowledge of things that work but also knowledge of things that do not work. He must make conscious efforts to capture as much of it as possible.
<br /><br /><strong>5. How to proceed</strong>
<br /><br />The simplest method is talking to people,  while they are on the job and especially when they are leaving the organisation.
<br /><br />An exit interviews must never be a ritual. Neither must it be an exercise to just get the venom out nor an exercise to expose the underbelly that has prompted the resignation.
<br />It must be a concerted effort to gather what was the knowledge acquired between joining and leaving the organisation.
<br /><br /><strong>Interviews work if the organisation is small</strong>.
<br /><br />As the organisation grows in size one needs a more formal system, at the very least a simple archival system managed by a clerk or secretary but on a larger scale, a sophisticated knowledge repository, a kind of electronic cupboard where at least the final version of presentations, documents and spreadsheets of key business events can be stored.
<br /><br /><strong>6.Problems faced</strong>
<br /><br />This sounds very logical but most organisations do not do this. The effort involved is huge and the rewards are neither immediate nor tangible. A brand manager joining a reputed FMCG company, for example, once discovered that they did not have the brand deck (plans, tools, research, messages) of the past five years of a key product. What the organisation did have is the financial numbers –but not a clear history of marketing messages it had put out before the consumer. Previous brandmanagers had handed over all documents to someone and it was kept somewhere. But no one knew who that someone was and what that somewhere was. In the absence of a simple archiving system, the new brand manager had to collate all brand related background information from scratch so that he could define the future brand positioning; a fully avoidable waste of energy and resources.
<br /><br /><strong>7. Wealth follows Knowledge but this information is lacking in organisations</strong>
<br /><br />Every organisation has a very powerful Finance Department that works round the clock to keep an eye on money flowing in and out of the organisation. Internal and external auditors, controllers and accountants keep a hawk’s eye on every bill and purchase order. But not even a fraction of that energy is used by companies to manage their knowledge. This indicates that most organisations do not believe that Lakshmi follows Saraswati: they do not believe that existence of knowledge systems improve efficiency and effectiveness and can provide raw materials to provoke new ideas or prevent old mistakes. Unless a leader believes that Saraswati is critical, he will end up with an organization of Sahadevas.
<br /><br />Take a step back. Check if you are creatively shunning this rather tedious matter of knowledge management. If you are, then remember the wise words of Ravan: it must be actually good for you.

<br /><br />&quot;My dear girl, the day you see I’m getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I’m going through. 
<br /><br />If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don’t interrupt to say: “You said the same thing a minute ago”... Just listen, please. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
<br /><br />When I don’t want to take a bath, don’t be mad and don’t embarrass me. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
<br /><br />When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don’t look at me that way... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life’s issues every day... the day you see I’m getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I’m going through. 
<br /><br />If I occasionally lose track of what we’re talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can’t, don’t be nervous, impatient or arrogant. Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. 
<br /><br />And when my old, tired legs don’t let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked. 
<br /><br />When those days come, don’t feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
<br /><br />I’ll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. With a big smile and the huge love I’ve always had for you, I just want to say, I love you... my darling daughter.&quot;

<br /><br />( Am not able to upload his picture)
<br /><br />Jaspal Singh Bhatti (3 March 1955 – 25 October 2012) was an Indian television personality famous for his satirical take on the problems of the common man. He is well known for his television series Flop Show and mini capsules Ulta Pulta which were shown on Doordarshan, India's national television network, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
<br /><br />Early years
<br /><br />Jaspal Bhatti was born on 3 March 1955 at Amritsar in a Rajput Sikh family. He graduated from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh in Punjab, as an electrical engineer. He was very famous for his street plays like his Nonsense Club during his college days. Most of these plays were spoofs ridiculing corruption in society. Before venturing into television, he was a cartoonist for the The Tribune newspaper in Chandigarh.
<br /><br />Flop Show
<br />His low-budget Flop Show show in the early 1990s is remembered even today. His wife Savita Bhatti produced the show and acted in all the episodes as his wife. Only 10 episodes were ever produced, but the show has had a long and powerful legacy and is well remembered. One of his co-actors Vivek Shauq has been very successful since his stint in Flop Show, having found a footing in Hindi cinema. On 10 January 2011, Shauq died from septicemia.

<br /><br />Subsequent work
<br /><br /><object width="336" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4730977"></param><param name="wmode" value="window"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-4730977" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="window" width="336" height="295"></embed></object> 
<br /><br />Bhatti's subsequently acted and directed the popular TV series Ulta Pulta and Nonsense Private Limited for the Doordarshan television network. What attracted audience to his shows was his gift of inducing humour to highlight everyday issues of the middle class in India.
<br /><br />Feature Films and Movies
<br />Jaspal Bhatti's satire on the Punjab police Mahaul Theek Hai (1999) was his first directorial venture for a full-length feature film in his native Punjabi language. It was well received amongst audience for its simple and honest humour. The cartoonist, humorist, actor and filmmaker was focusing on acting as he was getting numerous offers from Bollywood producers as a comedian. He played the role of Jolly Good Singh, a guard, in the movie Fanaa. He played a comical college principal in Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe. He also starred in the comedy Punjabi film Jijaji. Bhatti acted in Hindi Movie Aa Ab Laut Chalen with Kadar Khan in 1999.
<br /><br />TV Comedy Shows
<br />Bhatti appeared in SAB TV's Comedy ka King Kaun as a judge with actress Divya Dutta. In his latest stint, Bhatti and his wife Savita competed in a popular Star Plus show Nach Baliye which went on air in October 2008. The couple put their best foot forward to entertain the audiences with their dancing and comic skills.
<br /><br />Recent Developments
<br />In his later years, Jaspal Bhatti set up a training schoo and a studio in Mohali near Chandigarh called &quot;Joke Factory&quot;.
<br />He also launched a new 52-episode comedy series titled ''Thank You Jijaji' on Sony's family entertainment channel, SAB TV. It was shot at his own MAD Arts film school at Chandigarh.
<br />At a 2009 carnival at Chandigarh, Bhatti put up a stall displaying vegetables, daal and oils. The onlookers were invited to throw rings around them to win these costly goods as prizes to poke fun at the government's failure to control inflation.
<br />In 2009, Bhatti school’s, Mad Art’s, animation film on female foeticide won the second prize in the Advantage India organized by 1take media.[5] It won a certificate of merit at the IDPA-2008 Awards in Mumbai.
<br /> Bhatti was granted the Lifetime Achievement Award, at the first Golden Kela Awards.
<br /><br />Political Satire
<br />Bhatti was known for floating his political parties during elections to highlight the problems faced by the general public.
<br />In 1995, he floated the 'Hawala Party' delighting passers by with his original poker faced takeoff on growing political corruption in the country which was already a hotly discussed topic in the context of the Jain-Hawala Diaries.
<br />In 2002, Bhatti announced that he is starting the &quot;Suitcase Party&quot; &amp; released his manifesto alloting 5 seats to his family &amp; more seats to be decided based on the suitcase size of the prospective candidates.
<br />In 2009, the comedian announced that he is floating the &quot;Recession Party&quot; &amp; Bhajna Amli, alias Gurdev Dhillon, as his party's face from the Ludhiana. In his trademark satirical style, he kept his party's symbol as opium, drugs and alcohol for which he claimed that there will be no shortage of supply if his party is voted to power.
<br /><br />Critical response
<br />India’s leading media critic Amita Malik says of him: &quot;Bhatti has the correct style for TV, an understated, quiet humour which sinks in without shouting, and which mercilessly exposes both corruption in our every day life and the typical people, who thrive on it. The grim fact and the hard truths of our society so bitter otherwise are made so funny through the adept handling of Bhatti, that cleansing laughter is created out of common malpractices.&quot;
<br /><br />Death
<br /> On 25 October 2012, he died in a car accident. The Honda Accord car which the 57-year-old actor/director's son Jasraj Bhatti was driving hit a tree near Shahkot in Nakodar area of the Jalandhar district. The accident took place at around 1.30 am, when Jasraj lost the control over the vehicle while taking a blind turn and rammed into a roadside tree.

There are also many books and articles that tell you what you must do in office. But there will be very few people/ books or articles who will tell you what not to do.Every office has its set of dos and don’ts, but then there is also a set of general don’ts that you need to keep in mind. Here is a list these general don’ts for you and we are sure they will help you stay clear of getting embarrassed in office.1. Peep into someone’s laptop/desktopThe most annoying person in office is the one who peeps into his colleagues laptop screen. Make sure you are not this annoying person. No matter the urge to see what other people are up to, you must save yourself the embarrassment of being labelled the office’s peeping tom.2. Walk around like you own the placeIt is great to be confident, but it is a sin to be jarring. So, under no circumstances should you walk around like you own the place. It is advisable to keep your smartness in check and not throw your weight around. Keep it easy going and genuine, and everyone in office will like you instead of talking bad about you.3. Be loudOh my GOD!Please don’t be that loud person in office. Keep your voice level in check, do not play loud music and stay clear of all things loud. Loud people annoy colleagues like few other people/things do. Train yourself to talk softly yet be audible.4. GossipWe are sure you have heard this one before. It is imperative to stay clear of gossip, but we all know that this is not possible. Every nook and corner of office is full of gossip mongers. What you can do however, is keep your tongue in check. Don’t bitch everyone out to everyone, and don’t allow others to christen you the gossip king.5. StealingEvery office goer at some point in time is inclined to steal some office stationery: a pen, a paper, a folder, or a print out. Doing so once in a blue moon is okay, but don’t make a habit of it. Stealing is bad and you will be answerable and payable if you are caught.6. Lie/Blame othersWhen you find yourself in a soup or in tough situations you will be inclined to lie or shift the blame of your wrong doing on someone else. If you do this, you are putting not only your reputation at stake but your job too. Always stick to the honesty policy and play fair.7. Share your personal problems No one lives an easy life. Everyone has their share of personal problems just as you have yours. It would be naïve to share your personal problems with your work colleagues. We suggest you leave these issues at home and come to office with a clear mind. Remember, your colleagues aren’t your personal agony aunts.8. Make outIrrespective of how hot that colleague of yours is, making out in the office is just unpardonable. Making out is an extremely private affair and an office is the least private of places you know. Besides, if somebody catches you in the act, you can bid your job farewell.A list of general don’ts in work environments. Avoid committing these errors and you are sure to stay in the office good books.source: yahoo lifestyle

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/142999835_335791_49322444.jpg" />
<br /><br />You give but little when you give of your possessions.
<br />It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.
<br />For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?
<br />And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
<br />And what is fear of need but need itself?
<br />Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?
<br /><br />There are those who give little of the much which they have--and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
<br />And there are those who have little and give it all.
<br />These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.
<br />There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.
<br />And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.
<br />And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;
<br />They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.
<br />Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.
<br /><br />It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;
<br />And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.
<br />And is there aught you would withhold?
<br />All you have shall some day be given;
<br />Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.
<br /><br />You often say, &quot;I would give, but only to the deserving.&quot;
<br />The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.
<br />They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.
<br />Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all else from you.
<br />And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.
<br />And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?
<br />And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?
<br />See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.
<br />For in truth it is life that gives unto life while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.
<br /><br />And you receivers... and you are all receivers... assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.
<br />Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;
<br />For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother, and God for father.

<br /><br />She was born on June 1, 1929 as Fatima Rashid in Rawalpindi, British India, daughter to Jaddanbai and Uttamchand Mohanchand, a Hindu Mohyal Brahmin. Her mother was a well-known dancer, singer, actor, composer, and director. This is what paved the way for Fatima to become a child artiste (Baby Rani) as early as 1935. She is the sister of Bollywood actor, Anwar Hussain and Akhtar Hussain.
<br /><br />Nargis and Bollywood mega-star Raj Kapoor formed a reel romantic couple.
<br /><br />After playing the mother of Sunil Dutt, a Mohyal Brahmin also, from Jhelum, British India, in the movie 'Mother India', she subsequently married him on 11 Mar 58. She has three children from the Dutt marriage, namely Bollywood actor, Sanjay Dutt, and two daughters, Priya, and Anju. Her first daughter-in-law, Richa Sharma, Sanjay's first wife, passed away due to cancer. Her second daughter-in-law is Rhea Pillai, Sanjay's second wife, but they have since divorced.
<br /><br />Her son suffers from insomnia, and has problems with drugs. He was jailed for terrorist activities during the now infamous Bombay Bomb Blast case of 1993, and he is now facing numerous criminal charges in India. Her daughter, Anju, is married to Bollywood actor, Kumar Gaurav, who is the son of actor Rajendra Kumar. Her husband went on to win a seat in the Indian Parliament, and after his passing, her daughter, Priya, has taken over from her dad. Sanjay's daughter's name is Trishala, while Anju's is Saachi, who is now being groomed to appear in movies.
<br /><br />Pancreatic cancer claimed Nargis on May 3, 1981 - ironically the same year her son first appeared in movies. His first movie was Rocky.
<br /><br />Nargis and her movies, (approximately 50) which spanned from 1935 through on to 1967, continue to be popular even now.
