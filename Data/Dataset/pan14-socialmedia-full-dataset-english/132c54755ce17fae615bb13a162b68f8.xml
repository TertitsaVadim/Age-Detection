Thousands of customers queued to get their phones, which came with computing and Wi-Fi features, along with a bright touch screen. instantly competitors pushed smartphones with similar features onto the market.<br />In October 2011, as Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S, Apple said it retailed in excess of 4,000000 units of the iPhone 4S.<br />However, millions more are choosing Android smartphones. According to the newestinvestigations, twice as many Android phonesdevices  are being activated each day as Apple phonesdevices. Analysts have claimed that the prime reasons consumers choose Android over Apple is the cost.<br />This is a striking change from 2010, when Apple and Android were about equal, and a reflection of how Android phones have improved and turned out to be more largely available.<br />Nevertheless Apple, for a number of reasons, still remains the phone manufacturer to beat.<br />The iPhone 4S comes with a “virtual assistant,” Siri, that reacts voice commands by users to schedule dates, dictate text messages and conduct Web searches.<br />Although, on the exteriorthe new phone is virtually the same to the iPhone 4, it is packed with more improved technical innards, including a significantly improved camera. The iphone 4S also has a more powerful chip known as the A5.<br />The iPhone 4s works on two kinds of mobile networks, GSM and CDMA, which enables global use. Prices begin at $199 for a 16 gigabytes variation.<br />Apple will keep selling its older iPhone 4 through its usual networks but as an  8 gigabyte varient.

It’s suitable enough to replace your point-and-shoot camera regarding day-to-day activities, or possibly for holidays.<br /><br />Apple did plenty of work inside the camera lens to help with making exposure even better just for low-light settings, as well as added quite a few upgrades like image stabilization, 1080p movie recording, and much more.<br /><br />&lt;h2&gt;The A5 dual core processor is all you could want&lt;/h2&gt;<br /><br />The iPhone 4S runs an identical dual-core processor we saw launch included in the iPad 2, although under-coocked at 800 MHz to save battery power.<br /><br />Even working at 800 MHz, the 4S is extremely speedy. It's snappier than its Android competitors running 1-1. 2 GHz processors, except perhaps the Samsung Galaxy S II.<br /><br />In terms of where memory  is involved, the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ZvcnVtcy53dHNvLm5ldC9tZW1iZXJzL2VsaWNhcnRlcjgxOS5odG1s" target="_blank">iPhone 4s</a> holds 512MB, which equal to the 4S, and is 50% less than most competitors are wielding, which is to conserve power.<br />It doesn’t  matter the RAM the iPhone has because it's so quick no matter what you throw at it.<br /><br />&lt;h2&gt;So why should you choose the new iPhone 4S?&lt;/h2&gt;<br /><br />The 4S should replace your point-and-shoot cameras and Siri will most likely become an integral part of your regular routine in certain places you may not anticipate.<br /><br />While the iPhone 4S is not really a big step up in its looks from last year's smartphone, there's no refuting that the last smartphone was definitely striking (if rather fragile).<br /><br />Finally, the 4S runs Apples new operating system iOS 5. Bringing countless advancements that make the Apple iPhone 4S have personality and in fact twinkle.

It's not new, but it's still stunning. It doesn't possess a bigger screen or tapered design and style, but it's still the most eye catching smartphone you can get. And this is what precisely matters, right?. It's still the best-designed, most beautiful, and most substantial sensation smartphone I've ever owned.<br /><br />So what's different? Well what makes the iPhone 4S so distinct is  its innovative A5 chip, Siri, and its much improved 8 megapixel high-end camera.<br /><br />&lt;h2&gt;Siri truly is somewhat outstanding&lt;/h2&gt;<br /><br />Using Siri will not be a seamless experience, but when it does work, you feel happy. A passionate feeling overpowers your body. I have completed a task by exerting the utmost smallest quantity of energy. You won’t help but smile.<br /><br />Asking Siri for the weather, nearby places to eat and about stocks can be a amusing novelty, but the substance of Siri is communication. I spend 100s of hours walking, and no matter what I try, my typing remains  awful while I am moving about.<br /><br />Siri is here to assist. You can dictate to Siri what you intend to say in a note and Siri writes down the full message! While I am not willing to announce that using Siri in public places is ordinary quite at this point, I will say this…Siri will develop the way we accomplish jobs by using our iPhones, and eventually, our computers.
