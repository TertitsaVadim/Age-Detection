<br /><br />Especially today:
<br /><br />First i feel like shit i really didnt want to go to school today but finals i had to take.
<br /><br />So yeah i wore pajama pants to school because i didnt feel like dressing up for school and only being there till like 1:30 so yeah.
<br /><br />Well i got in trouble for it, was kinda pissed and didnt feel good all day. Told decker that the school system was fucked up and that this shit is gay its not like pajama pants discriminate the school, and he got all pissed and i got even more pissed and i kinda threw my purse, the trashcan and my pants at Mrs. Metzen. I was soooo close to getting 3 days OSS. yeah gay shit huh? i missed half my first block finals.
<br /><br />Well then after 7th block finals, i found out that Mr.Wells lied about me getting kicked out of his class bc i said bad words. WTF? he didnt even tell me anything about that and i was pissed and was telling everyone what happened and why i was crying bc i was so pissed.
<br /><br />Then last block finals i practically failed bc i didnt feel good and guessed on half that shit and went to sleep.
<br /><br />Well after school i went and put my pajama pants back on just to piss them off again. My sister was being a total bitch and wouldnt pick me up so that made everyhing else worse bc of her fucking ass. 
<br /><br />Then i come home and i go to my room lock the door and go to sleep till about 4:30 then kayla calls me and she comes over, then about 10 min ago. my mom tells her she has to leave bc im in trouble for wearing pajama pants to school and that im grounded for a month bc of all the phone calls and shit from school and my grades and im like WTF? you guys are fucking gay, you guys dont understand what im fucking going through you dont fucking know me, you dont know what goes on at school? YOU DONT FUCKING KNOW, and if you would be in my shoes for a week you would fucking know, but you dont. 
<br /><br />and i wont get to see one of my best friends for like a long time, wont be able to hang out in the summer since i have gay ass summer school bc of FAT ASS HEADLEY!! yeah i told that to her too. i fucking hate that bitch.  And anyways i wont get to see her, but im going to her moms house this week i dont really care what my mom thinks about ti either. 
<br /><br />Fuck This Shit, Im Through.
<br /><br />I want to go to Oxford next year, i do not want to be here at all. I will find my way up there i dont really give a shit about it. FUCK THIS PLACE. never liked it in the beginning, and some people are stuck-up bitches. and i really dont like you, not saying any names.
<br /><br />Im really sorry but im pissed right now and this shit is pathetic and gay. 
<br /><br />Things I Learned Today:
<br /><br />- School system SUCKS!!
<br />- Dont wear pajama pants to school they make a big ass deal about it.
<br />- Parents take things seriously when they arent.
<br />- I HATE MY LIFE.
<br />- I wanna go back to AZ!!

<br /><br />till we met some guys got their numbers then all of a sudden everyone is talking to guys and shit...
<br />i kept telling the guys to leave and we cant go anywhere with guys because it will just cause shit.
<br /><br />well what do you know it did!!!
<br /><br />and they wonder why i always wanted to be inside unstead of outside in the fucking rain... but nooo.. were gonna go for a walk!! [in the rain]
<br /><br />i didnt wanna go. but they practically TOLD me too. and i did it for marina.
<br />next thing you know me and shleby are left behind like 30 feet. and we dont know where were going... then we realize were going to clints...fuckk..huh?
<br /><br />well me and shelby were like okay we asked them to stop next thing you know they are running..??
<br />so were like okay w/e were just gonna see if they notice when we get there and shit.. well we got there sat down... nobody said a damn word to us till i went to the street and layed down and morgan comes and jumps on me? 
<br />i didnt care about that, its just bs how first you drag us in the fucking rain only to ditch us for guys? 
<br /><br />yeah so we walk back, we get back to the house and realize morgana and amber are staying the night at clints house...dont wanna know what happened? 
<br /><br />so were trying to get them to come back because its bs...
<br />Its was MARINAS PARTY!! not theirs...
<br /><br />and they dont thinks its a big deal about it? uhm wtf? how would you feel on your birthday and people leave you for gay ass low life guys? fuckng bullshit huh? 
<br /><br />then we told them that we were gonna tell her dad for them to get here, whcih we were really close to doing...
<br /><br />but then they come back act all kewla nd shit then we walk to dounut shop [not open] 
<br /><br />i wanna go back...but everyone is walking to MCDONALDS?? 
<br />morgan just left everyone AGAIN! her and clint...??
<br /><br />yeah who cares? but yeah everything was fine again... tillwe got back and morgan just had to say &quot;people are just pissing me the fuck off, and they wont say it to my fucking face.&quot; [really loud]
<br /><br />i got up and left... i was like wtf? thanks for making it even worse...
<br />so morgan gathers her stuff and was crying or something [ i was about to fall asleep]
<br /><br />but yeah morga tells clint ian and i think dave idk? to go to her house... and i think morgan and ian slept on the same couch together? who knows?
<br /><br />but yeah alot more shit went on.. i dont wanna say it...although the truth should be said!!
<br /><br />well thats how my night/day night was...
<br /><br />just lost like 2-3 friends.. 
<br />but ill get over it..kinda getting annoyed by them anyways...
<br /><br />well im gonna go sleep since i was kept up all night only to cause DRAMA and get ditched and shit!
<br /><br />well yeah and posting this might make people mad, well who the fuck cares... some people got to know!!
<br /><br />you know what:
<br /><br />i think its pretty gay how i
<br />got practically grounded because morgan
<br />just had to stay the night at my house and 
<br />my mom didnt know about it 
<br />because morgan just had no place to go
<br />so i was a good friend and said sure
<br /><br />then morgans mom blames me
<br />for morgan staying the night
<br />at MY house when MORGAN just HAD to 
<br />stay the night
<br /><br />So then i blows it off 
<br />because morgan is my friend.
<br /><br />i then goes to this birthday party
<br />and morgan ditches me and the other girls
<br />to hang out with a dude
<br /><br />I think theres some problems about this:
<br /><br />1) HELLO? not your birthday you do NOT call the shots
<br /><br />2) YOU know it wasnt your birthday but you think...all well im the shit and everybodys gonna love me anyway....WRONG!
<br /><br />3) FRIENDS NEVER PICK A DICK OVER A CHICK
<br /><br />4) when that guy decides that hes done with you....your gonna wish you didnt ruin your friends birthday party
<br /><br />5) YOU RUINED YOUR FIRENDS BIRTHDAY PARTY.... IDK about her but id be fucking pissed and never invite you to my party again.
<br /><br />6) YOUR A SELFISH LITTLE GIRL WHO NEEDS TO GROW UP AND REALIZE NOT EVREYTHING REVOLVES AROUND YOU AND THAT YOUR FIRENDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THEN A FUCKING SKATER DUDE WHO IS GOING NOWHERE WITH HIS LIFE

<br /><br />I wrote this paper in defense of gay marraige. I'm not gay but i personally have gay people in my family and I hate it when people judge other people because they aren't like them. Gays are normal people like me and you they just are attracted to the same sex as themselves.
<br /><br />It doesn't matter who it is love is love you shouldn't get criticized about it. They go through so much judgment its not fair, people just need to accept the fact that not everyones the same. People should be able to get married without going to jail for it.
<br /><br />As a result, I think gay marriage should be legal everywhere. They shouldn't have to travel to a different state where it is legal to get married they dont make straight people do that.

<br /><br />You've been there for me
<br />through the good times and bad
<br />I know I can count on you
<br />to be there when I'm sad
<br /><br />Life without you
<br />just wouldn't be right
<br />I wouldn't be able to get through
<br />each day and night
<br /><br />When I've had a bad day
<br />I know that you're only a call away
<br />When life takes that crazy turn
<br />You are always there to help me learn
<br /><br />We've had so many good times together
<br />I know we'll be best friends forever
<br />No matter where we are
<br />I know we'll never be too far
<br /><br />You're my idol, my sister, my friend
<br />We'll be together till the end
<br />Even when we're old and gray
<br />You'll be here still, to help me get on my way
<br /><br />No, thank you!
<br />I dont know who i would be without you. This poem i found somewhere pretty much tells everything...your the bestest! Im so happy i came to kansas and met you. cough i mean at the border. lol. but anywho, serisously, i dont know who my best friend would be if i didnt have you. Your without a doubt the bestest friend ever ...your number 1 by far. I wouldnt be fucking crazy without you, my life would be so boring. You made me more outgoing and able to say what i think. Not afraid to do shit. And you wonder why i helped you threw everything..how i risk anything for you? Because you have done the same for me. You know if you ever need someone to talk to, or someones shoulder to cry on, or just to plain hang out whenever, im here. Im so happy that were spending more time together...ive gotten your mom to trust me more and the same with you and my mom. although they never stopped us before. Just remember all them fun times, all the shit we made up and said, all the people we made fun with and how we make fun of each other, all them stupid ass fights. all the guys i told you or you told me that they arent worth it and to get over them but didnt care then had to find out by ourselves, and you nor i said told you so.. we just let it go and were still there helping each other threw it. and then we find someone new and we tell each other that you 2 are so cute and help each other. all those pictures we took together! i love those. those will never be forgotten. 
<br />Even if you or i move away once were out of school or even during school, i dont think anyone could replace you. i might tell them they are my best friend but they arent. You know saying all this shit might be freaking you or others out, but damn i dont give a shit. Your my bestest friend ever. and i had to tell you sometime. And im not obsessed with you or anything its just that your an awsome person to be around, altho u do get kinda annoying sometimes or piss me off but that shit dont matter, your still kick ass. and dont let anyone tell you other wise. 
<br />Your like a sister to me, i count you as my blood. altho im white. but yeah, your the shit. and you can have my job bitch! lol.
<br />I Love You Always and Forever Like A Sister!

It seems like everythingg that i've ever loved has gone away. and the simple pleasures i used to enjoy just arent as grand. I just.... fuck. Everyone thinks that im such a fucking happy person.. but i cry myself to sleep most nights. I cry over gay things. I cry over things like a guy i like doesnt like me back. i never used to fucking do that. For a while i had a pretty high self-esteem, and it just recently fucking plummeted. i dont think it's ever been this low. i question my every move. i look fat in this. my hair looks gay. my teeth are yellow. i have alot of zits. I just cant do anything without questioning myself about how bad i look. i'm not happy without a boyfriend, i never used to be this way. i was miss independent. and i made fun of girls who fucking valued themselves on their boyfriend.. or who fucking liked them. what the fuck is wrong with me?

<br />And we decided to go to Mikeys house for a bit, but i was like hey lets go to sonic, im buying.. 
<br />then we were leaving, we saw a car break checking on A street and i say to randy &quot;she cant drive...lol&quot;, so we turn onto 15th street on a green light, they lady turns on a red light, well the lady [witness] behind us pulls onto the left side of the road and we turn onto the right and the lady that hit us turns onto the wrong side of the road.. and i tell randy &quot;im gonna laugh when she gets into a car crash&quot;...since there was a head on car, and the witness car and us were about 5 ft away from each other and she tries to pass us and she turned right into my side of the truck, the window was down and i was lookin while undoing the seat belt and jumped torwards randys side. We stopped and randy got out of his truck and was like &quot;OMFG! are you kidding me?&quot; and the girl gets out and was like &quot;omg im so sorry, i am i really am&quot; and i was trying to get out of the truck... and the lady hoped back into her car and randy was like &quot;No! your not leaving no!!&quot; and she was like backing up and randy was trying to get her to stop and i was screaming on the top of my lungs while bawling my eyes out.. and she almost ran randy into the tree but he let go and she drove off.
<br />i just dropped into the middle of the street bawling and couldnt stop skaking.
<br />then the lady who was behind us [the witness] and some other people who saw it came over and got me. and i went straight to randy. i couldnt breathe at all. 
<br />then we called everyone. and everyone came over, we saw cops driving everywhere trying to catch her then finally they did and took her to jail.
<br />and yeah had to write a report out. was there for about an hour.
<br />then went home.
<br />randys truck isnt that bad just the passenger door. and she just got a broken headlight.
<br />and btw she was DRUNK...
<br />im still shaky too.
<br />man theres my highlight of the summer.
<br /><br />so to everyone...im alright and so is randy is too. altho hes gonna go to the doctors tomorrow to make sure everything is okay, becasue his neck and back hurts.
<br /><br />but id have to say that was some fucking shit there, just hearing the car hit our car was insane. i thought it was bad. and it felt like we were gonna tip over too.
<br /><br />well right now i ahve a headache.

<br />I'm so confused.
<br /><br />I feel like everything I touch just turns to nothing. Just like that. My friendships are turning to mere memories, my life withering away. It's nothing I could possibly control, it's actually completely out of my range... and anything I can help I miss just as what I could have done takes effect. 
<br />    I feel guilty, pathetic, alone, imperfect, self-conscious, like the entire world is staring at me like I'm a freak. Now that I think about it... maybe I'm just scared. Scared of losing what I have. Which is strange, because I don't think I am... am I?
<br />    I would have no reason to feel like that... everything is going so right, and I still feel like this. Everything's going actually near perfect... and I still have this uncontrollable sense of this indescribable pain, a mixture of so many different emotions. I don't want to tihnk this, but maybe it's happening.. am I going down the road that it took so long for me to stray from? Am I turning into the person that I really don't want to be? I didn't think so... it's nobodies fault, and nobody can help it. Only me- just me.
<br /><br />To anyone I've hurt... I'm sorry. I'm sorry in so many ways that words cannot express. I'm sorry for screwing up my friendships, I'm sorry for fucking up so much, I'm sorry for being what I'm trying not to be... I honestly think I've tried so hard to be a person I'm not, that I've lost all connections with who I am. Like I've been walking down a dead end road, and finally reached the end, try to turn around but the road dissappears. I'm stuck in third gear trying to stop but only going faster. The only thing I can do at this point is stop myself completely... but I couldn't do it. No, not ever. What good would that do, to make the people's lives around me even more miserable than they are? But then think how many people would be happy I'm gone. It's a move I could never make, but have been tempted to do so strongly...
<br /><br />Like being in a crowd full of all these amazing people I know, the people I love, the people that I need most. Trying to talk to them but none of them hear me. They finally notice me and then walk away without a care, and I'm stuck completely alone... because I honestly feel like I have no one to talk too. No one to relate.
<br /><br />...I think I need help.

She's sleeping upstairs- the oppurtunity of isolation. While she lay restfully in her bed, he takes another drink; becoming less and less stable. I walk into the room asking a simple question. That simple question turns into an argument. That argument turns into a rage.
<br />    Pinned up against the wall, nothing I can do. His fist has struck my face, his hand around my neck. Struggling, suffering, screaming inside- outside? Silence. No expression except for the tears streaming down my face. No expression except for the increasing grip on my neck, the stinging on my cheek, and welt on my arm. I fade in and fade out. My  heart skips a beat. Release.
<br />    He lets go and walks away. Just simply walks away. No big deal. Shock. Adrenaline. 
<br /><br />The rage that still fills the air, the chance to strike back. 
<br /><br />I simply stay where I am, without a sound.

<br />3 - Dec 3rd [his birthday]
<br /><br />this song reminded me of him tonight and it means everything....
<br /><br />Always Always and Forever Always Always and Forever
<br />Sitting here and thinkin back doing time when I was young
<br />My memories good as day
<br />I'm listening to the dishes cling you were downstairs you would sing songs of praise and all the time we'd laugh at you and all the time that you stay true to us and I will say
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br />Said I thank you
<br />Will always thank you
<br />More than you would know and I could ever show
<br />And I love you will always love you
<br />Theres nothing I won't do to say these words to you
<br />That you're beautiful forever
<br /><br />Always Always and forever
<br />You were my mom you were my dad the only thing I ever had was you
<br />It's true
<br />Even when the time got hard you were there to let us know when we get through
<br />You showed me how to be a man
<br />You taught me how to understand the things people do
<br />You showed me how to love my God
<br />You told me that not everyone knows the truth
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br />And I thank you 
<br />Will always thank you 
<br />More than you would know and I could ever show
<br />And I love you 
<br />Will always love you 
<br />Theres nothing I won't do to say these words to you that
<br />You will live forever 
<br />Forever and ever Forever and ever
<br />Said I thank you will always thank you more than you would know and I could ever show
<br />And I love you will always love you 
<br />There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you
<br />That I thank you will always thank you more than you would know and I could ever show
<br />And I love you will always love you there's nothing I won't do to say these words to you 
<br />That you will live forever

<br />There's always some reason
<br />To not feel good enough
<br />All smudged on to one pretty face
<br />Just to bring out the imperfections underneath
<br />No self control nor confidence to see the lies
<br />All coming up from underneath
<br />Just to be seen by someone
<br />But there's no one to compliment your truths
<br />No one to see your cries for help
<br />Nothing to bring this beautiful addiction to a stop
<br />Especially when you are more than good enough

<br />When you look at me weeping
<br />I've always wondered if you could see,
<br />Everything that is inside and about me
<br />I've always wondered what you are all about,
<br />Because inside I'm falling in love
<br />I've always wondered was it all my fault,
<br />Or was it just something that was all laid out
<br />I've always wondered was it love or was it pain,
<br />In my heart it must have been pain
<br />I've always wondered why you pushed me away,
<br />You just wouldn't let me stay
<br />I've always wondered, could I forgive myself,
<br />For trusting in someone else
<br />I've always wondered, could I forgive you,
<br />For leaving my heart broken with you.

<br />And the trigger will be pulled
<br />One more slip up
<br />And I'm gone
<br />Because suicide is the name
<br />Of this relentless game
<br />And selfishness is the last thing
<br />Running through my mind
<br />When all I want
<br />Is what's best for me
<br />And not what's best for you
<br />One more deathly thought
<br />And a reality it may become
<br />One more evil word spoken to me
<br />And bullets will spit from my tongue
<br />Because you mean nothing to me
<br />And you'll be the first from my list
<br />Then it will be me
<br />Gone.

<br />Every letter in every word screams to be read
<br />Tempting to the eye, but yet you do not see
<br />The time it took to write this down
<br />All the love and devotion into each phrase
<br />Every pause meant to be heard
<br />&amp; every sentence that falls into play
<br />But yet these words mean nothing to you
<br />But splotches placed on paper.

<br />Like an overbearing cancer,
<br />It turns me black,
<br />And I wither down, I'm insignificant
<br />So small
<br />Slowly I'm about to break,
<br />See me evanesce into an epitome,
<br />Of what you used to be,
<br />I feel such a gruesome drag,
<br />Singing monotonous songs.
<br />Oh how they abstract my thoughts from you,
<br />Yet still they accentuate the painful, Decrepit love I once felt for you.
<br />Cutting,
<br />Slicing,
<br />Bleeding down,
<br />The tears tarnish my narcississtic reveries
<br />Of my long awaited death.
<br />My life has been threatened once again,
<br />By this haunting euphoric dagger,
<br />Which is my only escape,
<br />Into a reality, Where I will never fade away,
<br />Here in my thoughts,
<br />This melancholy daze.
