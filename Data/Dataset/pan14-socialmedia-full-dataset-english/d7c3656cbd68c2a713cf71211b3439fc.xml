<br /><br />I am alone in the desert standing there,
<br />Holding an empty bag that held my dreams,
<br />Now as shattered as the sand I am standing on,
<br />Trying to desperately to hold on but getting nowhere,
<br />Trying to find the light but seeing the dark,
<br />Wishing, hoping, that someone will save me...
<br /><br />River of tears
<br /><br />I am crying a river in the desert of broken dreams. I stand trying to keep from drowning unable to breathe unable to move. Hearing only the pain and suffering and loss of what was once a beautiful flower. Now dead and welted gone and lost to the sands of time in which I reside. Someone please save this broken hollow shell. Before there is nothing left but the river of tears.
<br /><br />Chain of love
<br /><br />I sink to the dark depth as I sink I use our love to ancker you to me to hold you to me as I hold you to me. The storm above rages and we just float on the sea of life forever linked forever held together one without the other one is the other one unit but separate always in love but never loved.
<br /><br />The shadows
<br /><br />I am a lonely wretched being that walks in the shadows. My body twisted and mangled form the light. I will forever be in the shadows always loving but never loved. Always they’re but never there. You feel my presence in a cold breeze and you don’t in the heat. You see me as a shadow and not as the light. I am in front of you when your eyes are closed and gone when they are open. Nothing in this world will save me nothing but one oh where are you love. I search for you in the light before finding. you where are you love I look. The night but never finding you oh where are you my love. I keep looking but you evade me like the shadow evades the sun.
<br /><br />My flower
<br /><br />I sit here looking at an image wondering if it is you. I can’t imagine what you look like. Are you scared? Are you cute? Are you in pain? These are the things I wish to know about you my flower. A flower that blooms so beautifully. But I will always be the bee the sun that helps you grow and live. The sun and the flower as one but a part. We are as friends but we love and respect each other. You will always have my ear my flower.
<br /><br />The lost one
<br /><br />How many times can I say it I love you I will shout it from the roof tops or from the
<br />Tallest mountain if I thought you would hear it I love I miss you when you are gone my
<br />World falls apart when you are here I am so happy I can’t breath you are lost but I will
<br />Find you died I will follow nothing can stop me from being with you but you I say I love
<br />You but all I hear is echoes in a empty room I scream your name hoping you will hear it I wish my lost one will come home
<br /><br />The unattainable
<br /><br />As I sit here a flash of you. What a flash of you I can't breathe. I calm down you are
<br />My unattainable. A flash I can't breath I wish you where here. I want to hold you I
<br />Care for you but all I get in return is nothing. The cold empty life of love is so
<br />Cruel. I want to brake the chains of my despair. I want to free myself of the hold you
<br />Have on me. I would die for you. I would give up the world for the asking. You are my
<br />Unattainable.
<br /><br />The gift
<br /><br />I am a lonely retched creature that is worthless than the air I breathe. I want death’s gift. I need it but he won’t grant it. I am doomed to walk alone always seeking but never finding wanting but never getting. Please release me from my pain you are the only one you are my death give me your gift.
<br /><br />The box of broken dreams
<br /><br />As I put you in a little box of lost dreams and lost loves. I do it with a heavy heart. I don’t want to put you in the box. You are the only one that does not deserve to be in there. But I must so I will not love again. You take all the love I had and pull it in with you. I wish that you were in my heart instead. But I must put you in the box of broken dreams.
<br /><br />The bird
<br /><br />I love you I hear your name whispered in the wind my throat closes my heart races I lose all concentration I can't breath and when I can I have short slow breaths you are my love my soul you are my bird fly free as the wind takes you
<br /><br />The forgotten love
<br /><br />I sit here I try to forget you. I tried not loving you. But you are in my soul. You are my soul but yet you will never know this for I am the forgotten love. I shall never look up on such beauty again for there is none that matches yours. I will never look up on the one and only true love. I am your forgotten love never to be seen or heard. All ways in the shadow never in the light. Never in the love.
<br /><br />My world
<br /><br />As I sit here hear. I think of you. I know I will never hear you again or see you again you left me. You went to a better please. I will never see you smile. I will never hear you laugh. You where my world. I would give it all up to have you back. But as we die we live as we live we die. You say I love you and hope you understand why I did this. I love you and never will ever stop loving you Evan in death. Death can not pull us apart don’t cry over me. Don’t be sad be happy ill be watching over you. But when you left me you left my world.
<br /><br />My angel
<br /><br />I think of you your name but a whisper on my lips the words I love u choke me I cant
<br />Breath when I think of you I die when you are gone I dwell in darkness with out you my
<br />Heart is not the same when you are a foot a way my love is strong for you I would die
<br />And kill for you. You have a power over me that no one else has that over me your are my I call the heavens wanting you to be returned to me it is not right I suffer I burn in hell with out you u please my angel fly home to me
<br /><br />Cant breath
<br /><br />I wish I was with you. I cant breath with out you. You are the air I breathe. The life in my veins and the soul in my heart. You stole my love and ran. But yet I chase you. I am yours as the wind takes the dirt. I will sore to you at all times.
<br /><br />Can’t speak
<br /><br />You say I love you. I go to say it but nothing comes out. I cant speak I cant say it. I want to but nothing I wish you could. All I can say is I need to say it I have to say it. I try still nothing I will try one more time and I sit in fear. I l--l--love you I said it and I haller it from the roof tops. I love u I shout as the wind takes it.
<br /><br />Heaven and hell
<br /><br />I sit here thinking of you I wish I could see you I wish I was with you with one swift move meant I will join you in heaven or hell. Hell would be haven with you in it. I miss you deeply. I care for you. I love you but all I get back is a cold kiss of death as I wait to be taken. I see I will not. Be you have taken my heart I will take my life.
<br /><br />Life Mate
<br /><br />I love you at the depths of my soul. You are my life my mate my soul. I wish we where close. But I can’t see the river the river of love that is taking me a way from you. Come back to me you are my mate. I would wather cry. My life is not and I die I wish I could hold you. I wish I was there to protect you but my life is not as I die. You are my life. I love you. I love you. Remember all the love we have as my life is not as I die.

<br /><br />Ocean of tears
<br /><br />We are friends. I like to be friends. The word is but a tear in the ocean of life. If I cry it is because I lost you. All my tears are my friends. Please don’t make me cry. I have no tears left but one that tear you. I have cried many life times lets stop crying for we need are tears.
<br /><br />Star of love
<br /><br />You are a star. You shine so brightly in the heaves. You are so beautiful. I love the way you look. My heart is the havens you light my path. You show me the way. You brighten my life. I crave my stars touch. I need it but you are so far out of reach. I will hold my star in my arms when I can. But for now shine brightly. Be there to light my path.
<br /><br />Light of life
<br /><br />As I set in my dark room I look out. And see you sonnie who's name shines in the sky. who's name shines my life but the sun of my life is gone. You burned out. You are the sun of my life. Now I live in a dark room a dark life is what I see for me. You are the one that lighted my life and now I live in darkness total darkness.
<br /><br />The star of life
<br /><br />The stars are the life. I found my star of life. The star of life is my world is my life. How I crave her how I want her how I need her I wish I was with her my star will make me live. I need the star to live I cant live with out you my star my one and only star. The star is my life she is my star of life.
<br /><br />Fallen star
<br /><br />You fail for me. You who lived among the stars have fallen. You are my fallen star. I will protect you I will save you. I will fall for you only to pick my self up. I will always save my fallen star you will be my life you are my one and only fallen star. I have fallen for my fallen star that has fallen so deep for me. As deep as the havens are infinite we will be together my fallen stars.

The one that gives you happy ness joy life I finding my self hollow empty un worthy of you but I keep trying to turn your heart to me but all I fell is the emptiness that your love fills him with I am the rotten lonely being that only wishes you happy with every thing he has. When you only say hi my heart say yet when you say buy my heart say oh god no. I cant live with your smile I cant live with you. Come and be my angel of love.

<br />Her body still with anticipation
<br />Trying in vain to still her raging heart
<br />Swallowing hard,
<br />She hears the opening of the door
<br />Tensed muscles, strangled by her need
<br />The shape of her curves seeming to beg
<br />A soundless whisper, calling to my hand
<br />Touch Me,
<br />Set me on fire
<br />Taste my need
<br />And feed on my lust
<br />Like a moth to a flame
<br />My lips meet her's in a blaze of willed heat
<br />My strong arms pressing her gently
<br />Coaxing her down to the softness of the bed
<br />Brushing kisses down her neck
<br />They sting her skin,
<br />And consume her soul
<br />Her legs wrapped around my waist
<br />Pulling me closer into her
<br />Savage in her need to have me fill her
<br />She needs to feel me
<br />Needs to have me
<br />An unyielding desire,
<br />Urged on by my touch
<br />Pressed by my scent
<br />She aches with want
<br />Devoured by a primal instinct
<br />That threatens to drown her
<br />Steal her sanity
<br />And keep her captive
<br />Praying for her release
<br />Her eyes begging for my pity
<br />Arching her back I move deeper
<br />Pressing further into her velvety walls
<br />Burying myself, she can feel my heart race
<br />See the need carved into my face
<br />Her breath now racing along side mine
<br />Moaning as I bite her lower lip
<br />Like an explosion of need, want and lust
<br />A sweet release that shakes her body
<br />She cries out as I clenched her close
<br />Welcoming the slowing of her heart
<br />Listening as it moves in rhythm with mine
<br />She is satisfied

<br />Hearing you speak my name
<br />Beckoning me to answer
<br />Telling me you want me
<br />So I tell you that you're the answer to every question I've ever had about love
<br /><br />Without words I use my tongue to tell the tale of us
<br />Tracing your shadow scape
<br />Kneeling before you my eyes feast upon your angelic body and
<br />All its divinity and I praise you
<br />Because all of that is for me
<br /><br />I begin to indulge myself of your delicacies
<br />Digesting semi-sweet dark chocolate decadence as it melts
<br />Dripping down my chin
<br />Your taste is something that I ever couldn't re-create
<br /><br />Needing every atom of your anatomy
<br />Necessity is placed upon me knowing you are the source of my serendipity
<br />Dipping in and out of you stroking more than my consciesness
<br />Subconsciously I find myself rewinding our love scenes
<br />In my daydreams
<br />Seeing that face you make when you're making me cum
<br />And it makes me want you right there and then
<br /><br />Thinking of you in inappropriate places I get
<br />Tingling sensations in private locations where I wish you to be caught between a rock and my hard place
<br /><br />As wetness develops your legs begin to open and your spot turns to a backdraft and all I want you to do is extinguish it
<br />You know my body like the back of your hands
<br />And touch me and send me into ecstacy
<br /><br />your thighs quiver in anticipation of deep penetration which gets me high
<br />Body rising
<br />Sweating
<br />Panting
<br />Make-up melting
<br />Pulling my hair and
<br />Scratching my back
<br />I get a temporary case of tourettes because all I can say are four letter words in a four octave-range screaming your name
<br /><br />You feeding me makes me bilingual
<br /><br />I see your tongue pink between your lips and I want it between mine
<br />And I struggle
<br />As you lick torturing me
<br />I try to get away but
<br />Not really
<br /><br />Running out of room begging for more up against the wall that has been scuffed by your stilletos
<br />Again
<br />I pry apart my thighs and tell you to be still
<br />And you willingly submit to me because you love the way I dominate you
<br />Demanding that you cum for me so you do as your told
<br /><br />You've molded me so I'm good to no-one else but you
<br />You've conquered this once orgasmicless world and multiplied it
<br />Again and
<br />Again
<br /><br />My face radiates with after-glow
<br />My pillow scented by you
<br />A fragrance which haunts me
<br />My room smells of the best sex
<br />I
<br />Covered in body prints and finger prints and you above me
<br />Your name written indelibly upon my body in your genetic history
<br /><br />You feeding me makes me bilingual

<br />It’s beautiful.
<br />There’s nothing that could only be half as beautiful as the night.
<br />The stars are shining.
<br />The full moon above me.
<br />Why does the night pass by?
<br />Why couldn’t it last forever?
<br />The night is the time of the memories.
<br />It’s the time of the lovers
<br />and the time of the lonesome.
<br />It could be the time of rest,
<br />the time of sleep.
<br />But isn’t it too beautiful to stay at home and sleep?
<br />The night is magic.
<br />I can’t stay at home
<br />when it’s dark outside.
<br />The night is the time of mysteries,
<br />the time of demons,
<br />of vampires.
<br />But the darkness of the night isn’t dangerous.
<br />It’s peace in it, safety.
<br />It covers the guilty and the haunted.
<br />It’s merciful.
<br />The time when I forget about day.
<br />About all its problems,
<br />its sorrows.
<br />The time when I’m happy.
<br />The time when I’m sad.
<br />The night is everything for me.
<br />It’s all that counts.
<br />Nothing is as beautiful as the night.
<br />I wish it would never end.
<br />Just everlasting,
<br />lasting for eternity...

<br />It’s beautiful.
<br />But it brings the light.
<br />The merciless light.
<br />Showing everything.
<br />Fighting back the night
<br />until there are only some shadows
<br />telling about the beauty of the night.
<br />Of the merciful darkness.
<br />Too glaring.
<br />So cruel.
<br />It’s warm but...
<br />It could never be as warm
<br />as the night is beautiful.
<br />It’s hot and it’s light.
<br />I’m thinking of the night.
<br />Its coolness and its darkness.
<br />And again it’s killing my soul.
<br />The hectic of the day
<br />makes me crazy.
<br />I’m longing for the peace,
<br />the peace the night will bring.
<br />Hectic and noisy,
<br />that’s the day.
<br />Too many people
<br />running around,
<br />busy with nothing,
<br />unimportant stuff.
<br />Memories of the night...
<br />It’ll come again...
<br />It’ll bring peace and rest.
<br />It’ll make you forgetting...
<br />about sorrows and fear and problems.
<br />But it’s far away...
<br />The day...
<br />Too glaring...
<br />Pains...

<br />on wings of night; we were
<br />a rushing, a ferocious wind
<br />and we were hungry.
<br /><br />Some felt us coming.
<br />Some amongst the fat
<br />and frightened sleepers
<br />raised their heads, their hooded eyes
<br />would try in vain to pierce the dark -
<br />as always, they would try to find
<br />a refuge in a fire, that is all
<br />they ever knew to have,
<br />to stand between them and the endless night,
<br />filled to the brim with life
<br />that wants to feast upon them,
<br />wants to sink its flashing teeth
<br />without a second's hesitation
<br />deep into their unprotected flesh
<br />and tear their worlds apart
<br />in a bright ruby sacrifice,
<br />a baptism of blood that ends
<br />their meaningless existence.
<br /><br />But all the fires do
<br />is blind them further still
<br />and take away whatever chance
<br />they might have had to rise and flee,
<br />or to agree and find a balance,
<br />learn our ways and share our days and nights
<br />in some form that resembles an ecology -
<br />but they do no such thing,
<br />instead they quiver and they tremble,
<br />they pray, they stare -
<br />right up until their end.
<br /><br />Yet there are others, rare amongst them,
<br />who would try to see.
<br /><br />In every village, every town
<br />there are a chosen few
<br />who celebrate the coming of our kind,
<br />who see us not as monsters
<br />but as saviours and they prayed
<br />that we should come and take revenge
<br />on their behalf on all that madness,
<br />all that sadness,
<br />all those pointless lives and lies -
<br />those are the children of the night,
<br />they run to us and they care not
<br />if they should live or die,
<br />for those we are salvation,
<br />either way.
<br /><br />So here we are and here we stand
<br />in drifting veils of time and power,
<br />our family is here and there before us
<br />lies the sleeping town.
<br /><br />Bright is the moon above;
<br />it lights the shadow shapes
<br />of those few who have come to greet us,
<br />meet us and invite us to begin the feast -
<br />as is tradition, we enfold them first
<br />and some of those if they are strong and pure
<br />will join our family;
<br />and others will find sweet release
<br />and will receive the blessing of the night.
<br /><br />This serves to heighten our senses;
<br />and the hunger is now such
<br />that we must laugh and spin.
<br /><br />We stand together one more time as one,
<br />we play with our exquisite and excruciating need,
<br />we make it crest as high as it will be;
<br />and then we rush into the town
<br />and now, the feast begins.

<br />she pleaded,
<br />her tears flowed hot,
<br />so river wild,
<br />so river violent.
<br /><br />Take me,
<br />she cried,
<br />bleed me,
<br />make my heart
<br />as cold as stone,
<br />as cold as ice,
<br />I can no longer
<br />stand the pain
<br />of living;
<br />and yet,
<br />I cannot die,
<br />I am too young,
<br />I am too fair,
<br />there's far too much
<br />I haven't tasted,
<br />touched and made my own.
<br /><br />Bleed me,
<br />my lord, I beg of you.
<br />I swear I will be true.
<br />I swear that I will serve you,
<br />gladly and with fervour.
<br /><br />I'll take my youth
<br />and all my questions.
<br /><br />Through me,
<br />you too will feel
<br />alive again,
<br />you will once more
<br />discover how it was
<br />when first
<br />you saw the night,
<br />when first
<br />you raised your wings
<br />and soared
<br />into the singing,
<br />into the radiance
<br />that others
<br />never could perceive,
<br />I heard you speak of it,
<br />I know your wonder
<br />is alive,
<br />my Lord, I beg of you,
<br />take me this night
<br />and bleed me,
<br />bleed me,
<br />make me whole.
<br /><br />The ancient vampire lord
<br />stood still and cold,
<br />in silent white of ages,
<br />already did he know
<br />that he would
<br />take her tears,
<br />that he would
<br />drink her tears,
<br />and leave her drained
<br />but not of that,
<br />her burden,
<br />destiny,
<br />the rivers of her soul.

<br />once perfect,
<br />once a pale sweep
<br />of unbroken desert dunes,
<br />has felt my kiss
<br />and now it cries -
<br />ruby tears are welling up,
<br />are slowly sliding
<br />down your throat,
<br />glistening, delicious
<br />tears of joy,
<br />of life
<br />of your awakening.
<br /><br />I am always moved
<br />when I thus watch
<br />the sorrow of the body,
<br />expressed, released,
<br />out in the open now
<br />for all to see -
<br />and it was always there,
<br />and not to know that
<br />is the deepest
<br />of illusions.
<br /><br />Here, watch with me.
<br /><br />Observe with fascination
<br />as your treasures flow
<br />across your breast
<br />and make their way
<br />to your most intimate
<br />of oceans - this is my
<br />sacrifice before I start
<br />to make all this my own,
<br />my gift to you,
<br />the first of all,
<br />the most important
<br />lesson of your life.
<br /><br />Now close your eyes.
<br /><br />Give up your yesterdays
<br />and your tomorrows -
<br />all those are gone,
<br />will never be
<br />and you and me
<br />will take a journey
<br />new and bright,
<br />into the night
<br />a dawn of radiance
<br />awaits.
