A horse.
<br /><br />A horse. Now look. London (in the eyes of London) is the centre of the universe, the hub of all creation. And it’s about 99% tarmac. Somehow a horse doesn’t feel quite appropriate (although I can’t say for certain, as I’ve never felt a horse – never even be invited).
<br /><br />And anyway, in the struggle to select something that <em>is </em>appropriate the whole subject is a no-brainer. Angel of the North. Fairy of the South.
<br /><br />Who could argue with that?

<br /><br />President Touré, clothed in traditional ethnic cloth, told carefully controlled world media that his devoted, loyal people had finally been rewarded after years of preparation.
<br /><br />“This thing, what it is” he said “come at a very good time”.
<br /><br />Observers agree that Mali has striven to satisfy all of the required conditions demanded of Mass Genocide candidates. Stringently observed lack of education, inability to do even the simplest thing without foreign aid, chronic corruption at all levels of government and armed forces, along with rampant police brutality have all combined to make this little hell on earth the ideal setting for a swathe of mindless tribal killings and government-organised mass murder. And all for the sake of deciding who gets to live in which collection of mud huts.
<br /><br />The neighbouring candidate countries of Niger, Senegal and Mauritania declared the result misleading, demanded a secret recount, and later issued a statement to say they would be hosting their own Mass Genocides anyway.

<br />Just been reading a few posts and one or two of them actually do something very unusual on PAN - they (wait for it, wait for it) actually ASK A QUESTION!!! I know it sounds incredible but, yes, there is occasionally content here which isn't just a cut &amp; paste of a sh*te joke from a US &quot;humor&quot; website. Ah, but...
<br /><br />There's always a downside. I can't help but notice how many people respond to a question by saying &quot;I don't know&quot;.
<br /><br />Tell me, what is the fenkling point in that? OK, on Yahoo Answers the resident dweebs do it because, to them, life revolves around earning points for answering (or not - it makes no difference) questions. But all you achieve by doing the same thing on PAN is show yourself as a look-at-me-I-haven't-got-a-clue twat.
<br />For sharon's sake, will you please knock it off? Sometimes the normals like to peruse these answers on the off-chance there might just be something interesting in there.
<br /><br />&quot;Sorry hun, can't help you there&quot; rings no bloody bells, believe me.

<br /><br />Do you know what pimping is? I suggest you check in a dictionary, and also do a bit of research to discover what pimping frequently entails in terms of exploitation and abuse.
<br /><br />Don’t give me any guff about “it’s just a word”. N*gger, c*nt, sp*stic, dy*e – they’re all words too. And they are words whose meanings are deeply offensive to anyone with even a modicum of morality.
<br /><br />So please stop plummeting into the seedy world of rap (or should that be “rape”<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4185//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> jargon – behave like adults.

		<document id="e5fcb7b4b764582161dea8e64ed2049a" url=""><![CDATA[You keep it all in<br/><br/>Now, just a blinking moment. With the Times today comes one of those mini catalogues selling all kinds of guff for people with smelly feet, ambulation challenges and poor taste in household artefacts.
<br />And on page 12 (I might be making that bit up) is a thing for women. A girdle, effectively. And its sole purpose is to make the wearer look “inches” slimmer.
<br />It worries me, to be honest. Well – “honest” isn’t the right word because this undergarment essential is all about dishonesty.
<br />Makes you look inches slimmer.
<br />Why? It raises a number of questions, does this.
<br />Question number A: Are you so ashamed of your figure that you will buy a device that hides it?
<br />Question number B: What is its ultimate purpose beyond this visual deception?
<br />That latter question throws up some interesting end-of-evening possibilities because, as they say, a lie only remains of use until it is inevitably uncovered and, quite lidderally, this is what is bound to happen with this flesh-squashing whassisname. I see the scenario unfold. Rather flabby slapper dons her figure trimmer and goes out for the night, trying to look as good as possible to snaffle some bloke. Said victim will see this rather svelte creature, feel that physical attraction and, if he gets lucky, accompany her on the journey to her/his place.
<br />As she walks into the bedroom and prepares to get undressed, does she experience an “Oh, shit” moment because she’s only too aware that her craven deception is about to be revealed? As he lies there, expectant and panting, is he suddenly going to hear a faint “blup” as the rolls of previously hidden flab burst into the room, knocking over the table lamp?
<br />The difficulty is, it’s got to that too-late-now stage, hasn’t it? A truly awkward moment…
<br />And here’s the dilemma. If he turns round and says “To be honest, I suddenly feel a bit ill and you’ll have to go” he’s going to be open to the accusation that he’s a shallow b*stard who should – if he has at least a grain of moral fibre – see the beauty within; the body shape is unimportant. Right, OK. So if the body shape is so sodding unimportant why has she gone to the frankly painful trouble of making herself look like something she’s not?

<br />The email (addressed to Dear PayPal Member - which is the real giveaway; authentic emails are addressed to your proper username) describes a purchase you have apparently made for an item.

		<document id="150d9161a70bc6ff7ac70d2cc744ad38" url=""><![CDATA[Accentuate the positive<br/><br/>OK, so this week ended up being a fairly bad one to the extent that I was made redundant. But, after a short period of feeling a bit sorry for myself, reality kicked in and reminded me that, as a nation, we Brits have a habit of only seeing the worst and forgetting to mention the good in things. Let me explain.
<br /><br />The company I worked for was, until two years ago, owned by my parents. They sold up and retired, and the company took on new owners. Profit results for the quarter just gone were down £50k on the previous year – quite a shortfall given the size of the company. My job, by the way, was a mix of office sales, technical support, arranging and processing samples, and consumables purchasing.
<br /><br />OK, then. We can see what happened in one of two ways. We can go negative and say that our new and apparently sh*t hot Commercial Director and new and sh*t hot National Sales Manager guided the company, with some aplomb, to disastrous sales figures and as a result I lost my job.
<br /><br />That is negative. And it completely ignores the fact that, between them, they spent innumerable hours creating some of the prettiest, most colourful Excel databases and sales meeting presentation slides the company had ever seen. One simply cannot lose sight of these creative achievements; some of them were, like, really gorgeous, and to forget that is to completely forget what it means to see the good in seemingly bad situations.
<br /><br />So I must salute them, and stop thinking of myself as the fallguy for failure. Thinking that way is pure selfishness. Far better to stand proud and say that for the good of the company I made the ultimate sacrifice – OK, the ultimate sacrifice was made by others on my behalf, but you know what I mean.

<br />In the world of cryptic crosswords Tim Moorey is a hugely respected figure. Among numerous other outlets, you'll find his name attached to the Mephisto puzzle in the Sunday Times. Not just a great setter, but a real authority in crosswordland.
<br />Anyway, he has a book out called <strong>How To Master The Times Crossword</strong>. I had an email today urging me buy a copy (I now have it on order from Amazon). The reason, apparently, is the final chapter 17, which is given the title &quot;Leaving The Best Till Last&quot;. It is devoted to a single Times crossword.
<br />It's one of mine.
<br />I've titled this blog Anonymously Famous because there's a tradition of anonymity with Times crossword setters. As far as I know (I won't be sure until I get my copy in the post) I'm not actually identified as the setter, but I really don't mind. I'm just thrilled to tiny bits that a crossword of mine has been selected for this kind of ... well, accolade is the only word for it.
<br />So I'm a bit happy at the moment.

Many of us take for granted the concepts of indulging in food and drink, safe in our warm houses, surrounded by relatives and friends, swathed in festive cheer.
<br /><br />Please spare a thought for those less fortunate. Me, for example. To be honest, buying presents this year has been a bit of a struggle – once I reached £1500 there was little choice but to call it quits, especially as I know the food and drink will probably end up costing about the same. Plus the new TV of course – that set me back a few quid, although I always say that if you want top quality 42” LCD with Freeview and integrated DVD recorder you must be prepared to lash out some wodge. But, having just spent £395 on a PS3 for the sake of just ONE flippin’ game (that was only £40 quid, for god's sake), it felt silly trying to play it on an old 21” TV – really didn’t do the graphics any justice. It’s possible to be poor AND a perfectionist, you know.
<br /><br />Anyway, all of this stuff has just about cleaned me out, and has led me to think about how difficult it must be – particularly at Christmas – for those without the little luxuries the rest of us take for granted. A Playstation 3? Everyone’s got one, right? No. To some (most, perhaps) this is as unobtainable as a satchel of big diamonds. Mind you, Karen Matthews has got one in prison, so it can’t be that difficult.
<br /><br />So, take a little time to consider the unfortunates. Especially me. I’m nearly skint. Send what you can, and Gawd bless ya.

<br /><br />Anyway, a casual sortie onto the Dave website (OK - for those who really don't know, Dave is one of the UK's freeview channels; but if you didn't already know that, the following is going to be pretty meaningless to you anyway) and I espy an invitation from them to sign up for their newsletter.
<br /><br />I hesitate. If you watch Dave regularly you'll understand my concern. If I sign up, does that mean I'll get an identical newsletter emailed to me every four hours for the next six years? And will it consist of a rolling sequence - 3 lines of newsletter text and 4 pages of advertisements? I just wondered, that's all.
<br /><br />While we're on the subject of freeview channels, could I also ask the likes of ITV4 and Virgin1 etc to apply more honest titles to some of the stuff it shows, e.g. <strong>The World's Most Tedious and Poorly Shot Videos</strong> and <strong>Revealed - Magic's Most Blindingly Obvious Secrets</strong>?

However, I also think people should be aware of how much extra Ryanair charges on top of what appear to be very cheap flights. Here's an example:
<br /><br />In April my daughter and I are flying out to Italy. Our stay is only 4 days, so we're taking hand luggage only - nothing to check in.
<br /><br />The total cost of the FLIGHTS is £52.96 - pretty good, huh?
<br /><br />The actual total paid, however, is a whopping £195.40 - that's no less than £142.44 on top of the flights.
<br /><br />This extra payment starts with the understandable &quot;Yes, I'd have expected that&quot; £104.44 in taxes, fees and charges. But there is a frankly outrageous £19.00 debit card fee. £19.00!!!
<br /><br />And, incredibly, a rather inexplicable £19.00 fee for airport check-in. And remember, we're not checking in any luggage. No priority boarding - no frills whatsoever.
<br /><br />I chose the dates because the flights were cheaper, avoiding peak times. But the reality is that despite higher prices at other times the overall effect wouldn't have been that great. Passengers are being ripped off with completely unjustifiable charges. Not on really, is it?

<br />Now look - I'm with everybody in appreciating the dangerous world of soldiery and the sacrifices &quot;our boys&quot; are making. But what makes this campaign so utterly British is the predictable and inevitable misspelling of a simple plural - the good old rogue apostrophe because people are too fkn brain dead to have learned the most elementary rules of grammar.
<br />OK, if the campaign is successful I have little doubt someone with a brain cell will ensure Highway Of Heroes becomes a reality, but in a way I think that's a shame. Go on - powers that be, please let it be called Highway of Hero's. Not only will we have a tribute to our armed forces but, as a special bonus, we'll also have a snapshot of the sht-for-brains society they represent.

		<document id="a6181d3f1d6c14fd5fa035700e4f5dc4" url=""><![CDATA[To the Left<br/><br/>You have to love trades unions. BECTU, the union of TV technicians, is staging a protest aimed at preventing the broadcast of an edition of Question Time featuring BNP leader Nick Griffin. It believes the BNP should not be given media coverage.
<br /><br />OK. Shall we talk about democracy?
<br /><br />Loathe it or despise it, the BNP is where it is because democracy has allowed it to achieve its current political standing. We may brand the BNP as – among other things – loonies, but many would say the same thing about the Green Party or even the Monster Raving Loony Party, and I somehow doubt BECTU would seek to prevent them from airing their views. The point is, democracy has rendered the BNP valid as a political entity, and that makes it entitled to a platform of debate.
<br /><br />Let’s face it, Griffin’s appearance on QT will achieve one of two things; he’ll either sway the audience to his way of thinking, which is a democratic process, or – I suspect more likely – make himself look like a tw*t under public interrogation, which is also a democratic process.
<br /><br />But to deny him his right to air his views is the opposite of democracy, and this is where BECTU risks shooting itself squarely in the face. Their stance on Griffin doubtless has at least some roots in the belief that what he seeks to achieve is the curtailment of certain rights to certain groups, based on nationality. That may be true, but the curtailment of freedom of speech to certain groups based on political beliefs is no better - pretty similar to communism in fact, and trades unions have always had an anachronistic association with left-wing tendencies.
<br /><br />Of course, BECTU would strenuously deny that has anything to do with it… wouldn’t you, comrades?

		<document id="b7be82d2ff4d8298bf53db78c380cbf5" url=""><![CDATA[The Bulger Killers - take 2<br/><br/>A recent post here really has confirmed the depths to which the PAN community has sunk. You only need to take a glance at the Shout box to know that this place has become the home of the illiterate and sexually desperate, but it’s the abysmal mindlessness of opinion that has helped to turn this place into the absolute pits.
<br /><br />For those of you who have offered your brainless baying-for-blood bullshit on the Bulger case, how about putting down your copies of The Sun and your cans of Stella for a few moments and trying to rustle into life the few active brain cells you may possess?
<br /><br />The killing of Jamie Bulger, by two young boys, horrified the nation and quite rightly. The law took into account their ages and passed sentence accordingly. Once that sentence had been passed, a process was put in place which would deal with not their terms in custody but what would happen upon their release. The courts decided that, once these boys were released, their identities and whereabouts should be concealed from the public. Why do think that was?
<br /><br />It was precisely because society is full of the sorts of pieces of shit, the barbaric, vigilante, answer-violence-with-violence dross which has posted its unthinking vitriol on PAN.
<br /><br />Jamie Bulger’s killers are not public property. They have been dealt with by the law and if one them happens to have infringed the terms of his release it is a matter for the courts to deal with. You may not like the court’s decisions, but those decisions are made according to law. It is none of your f*ing business.
<br /><br />You may want to shout your uninformed crap about injustice, but the worst injustice of all would be for these young men to be handed over to mob justice, i.e. your kind of justice.
<br /><br />My opinion is that these youths should have been given significantly longer sentences and eventually released under even tighter controls, but it’s not for me to make such decisions. And it isn’t for you either – your evil bile exposes you as the very worst sort of scum to be making any decisions at all.

Please bear in mind I already have about 99.99% each of the required portrait and fashion pictures (somewhere - probably on my laptop which I've left in the lockup like what I always do), but have decided to mention these anyway, just to be on the safe side.
<br /><br />You can keep all the pictures I take – in fact I can text them to you straightaway. Yes, I know, you’ll probably wonder why my studio consists of a couple of grubby bedsheets and a 2Mp camera phone. Well we all have to start somewhere and I won’t be able to buy the professional equipment (whatever that is) until I’ve passed my degree.
<br /><br />My course papers? Erm, apparently they’re being sent to me but must be delayed at the Post Office somewhere – I don’t understand it, honest I don’t. The actual name of the course? Oh, er, it’s just something I saw on the telly; there was this number I had to phone, can’t remember what the place was called.
<br /><br />Yes, you’re probably thinking this is just a desperate measure to try and fool some birds into coming around and getting their kit off for me. Really – how could you be so cynical? Do I look like anything but the consummate professional huh?
