<br />is it harmony in the bedroom
<br />is it understanding each other in a way no one else could or would 
<br />is it knowing exactly what the other wants or needs
<br />is it being there in their hours of need and vulnerability
<br />is it the difference between best friends and soulmates 
<br />could it be that no matter what they say or do you never get annoyed with them
<br />is it a mutual understanding
<br />or is it just something that is so hard to find that when it comes along you dont realise its there until its way too late
