<br /><br />Allah the Highest is always testing His people, particularly the believers.   Allah the Highest said: “WE CREATED MAN FROM A CLOT TO TRY HIM, SO WE GAVE HIM HEARING AND VISION”.  (S: 76 A: 2)
<br />Tests and trials can be through good things and bad things.  Good deeds are of the good things that can be trying.  Good deeds are also of Allah’s bounties to His slaves, which Allah guides them to, and helps them to do, however, they can still be of the trials and temptations the believers may be subjected to.
<br />The good deeds of Salah, Fasting, Charity, Hajj and helping others etc may lead a person to admire his own deeds, himself, and even to start to feel better than others, which leads to pride, which is one of the worst sins which can stop man from going to Paradise.
<br />Indeed, pride lead to Satan’s expulsion from Paradise, and he was one of the most worshipping Jinn, and he was close to Allah the Highest.  In fact, Allah the Highest called Satan ‘disbeliever’.  “AND AS WE SAID TO THE ANGELS: “PROSTRATE TO ADAM”, THEY PROSTRATED EXCEPT IBLIS (SATAN), HE REFUSED, WAS PROUD AND BECAME A DISBELIEVER” (S: 2 A: 34)
<br />Pride prevents a person from entering Paradise, for Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “Does not enter the Paradise, he who has as much as a grain of mustard of Pride in his heart”
<br />This is because Pride is one of the greatest sins, preventing man entry to Paradise, makes him loss Allah’s Mercy and leads him to the Hell-Fire.
<br />Therefore, if whatever good deeds a person does seeking to be close to Allah the Highest lead to him being proud and arrogant, then these good deeds might be the reasons for a person’s own destruction.
<br />So be weary of your good deeds for it is also a trial and temptation, just like any good thing.  Allah the Highest said: “EVERY SOUL WILL TASTE DEATH, AND WE TRY YOU WITH WHAT IS BAD AND WHAT IS GOOD, AS A TEST, AND TO US YOU WILL RETURN”.  (S: 21 A: 35)

<br />Did Not Spy on His Wives
<br /><br />Many of us experienced feelings of jealousy and suspicion towards one’s wife or husband which might lead us to spy on her or him.
<br />A man may go back home earlier than usual or if on a trip might return earlier than expected and unannounced, might even pretend to be travelling.  All in order to catch the betraying party red handed.
<br />Some husbands or wives might listen in on their spouse telephone conversations, or look into their mobile phones to see who called them and whom they called, at what time and for how long.  They also look into the messages to see if any of them is affectionate or even familiar in tone.
<br />Wives look into their husband’s cloths for hair, lipstick marks, any stains or strange perfumes.
<br />All this might not be evidence of innocence to the suspicious spouse.  They might feel that it is just a matter of time to catch them.
<br />This has never been the character of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, to the contrary, when he returned from a journey, he waited for few hours before going home, so that his wife can be ready for him.  At that time there was no telephones or mobiles phones.  The main thing is that he did not go home unannounced.
<br />Jabir Ibn Abd Allah Allah’s messenger’s companions said: “We were with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him travelling on an Expedition, When we reached Medina and we were going to our homes, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “Wait for going in until dark, so that the woman who did not comb her hair combs it and the one who has been left for a while shaves”.  (B: Nekah; 10 &amp; M: Redaa; 56)
<br />This is the Example of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  He would wait after his wives know of his return to Medina if he was travelling to give them time to tide themselves up, and not surprise them with his return.
<br />One might say that they were Allah’s messenger’s wives, no like any other woman.  I say that if a man chooses his wife well, and treats her well, he would see nothing but every thing good from her.
<br /><br />May Allah’s Prayer and Peace be upon our prophet and messenger Mohamed and upon his family and his companions.

<br />Hates Injustice
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him hated injustice and the unjust.  He avoided being unjust at any time, this is because of what he knew about Allah’s hate of injustice.
<br />Allah’s messenger’s companion, Anas Ibn Malek reported: “The prices went up during the life of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  People said to him: “Fix prices for us Allah’s messenger”.  He said: “Allah is the one who makes the prices and He is the One who withhold and the One, who gives, and I hope to meet my Lord and no one has any claim that I have been unjust to him, neither in blood or money”.  (T:Beyo;73 &amp; D:Beyo;49 &amp; Ma:Tegarate;27 &amp; Da:Beyo;13 &amp; A:2;337)
<br />Many of us will think that for the state authorities to fix the prices of some essential items without compensating for any losses is a common practice and is not unjust to any one.  However, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him who knew Allah the Highest best and is the most pious did not like to fix a price for any thing.
<br />It may be that the price would be good for the merchant and unfair for the buyer, and he would be unjust to the buyer.  Or it may be that the price would be cheap for the buyer and unfair for the merchant, and he would be unjust to the merchant.  In either case some one will have a claim against him on thee Day of Resurrection.
<br />This shows us how much was Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him keen to avoid being unjust to any one, in any way or form.  Such is the character of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, whom Allah the Highest made to be thee example for us to follow.
<br />May Allah’s prayer and peace be upon our prophet and messenger Mohamed and upon his family and companions.

<br /><br />Allah the Highest said: “MONEY AND CHILDREN ARE THE PLEASURES OF THE LOWER LIFE, BUT THE GOOD DEEDS WE KEEP ARE BETTER IN REWARDING AND BETTER HOPE”. (S: 18 A: 46)
<br />And Allah the Highest said: “ALLAH INCREASES THE GUIDANCE OF THOSE RIGHTLY GUIDED, AND THE GOOD DEEDS THAT REMAINS ARE BETTER WITH YOUR LORD IN REWARDING AND BETTER RECOMPENSE”. (S: 19 A: 76)
<br />The good deeds that remain are the good deeds which are recorded in our book of deeds, which remain for us in the Hereafter.  Every thing a person does will perish eventually even if they remain for thousands of years after he is gone.  Also it does not do who does it any good except if it is a good deed.
<br />Every thing we do of eating, drinking, dressing, or enjoying ourselves does not remain, except the good deed that is done for the sake of Allah the Highest or the what we did to displease Allah the Highest, they do not perish when a person perishes.  They will remain in the person’s book of deeds to be taken into account when the person means his creator.
<br />All the deeds we do in this life, we will see its recompense and feed back in this life, except what was to please Allah the Highest or displease Him.  The person will see their full recompense in the Hereafter when he meets his Lord.
<br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “Three things follow the dead (to his grave) two return and the third remains with him.  His family and property return and his deeds stay”.   (M: Zohd; 5)
<br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him also said: “The slave of Allah says: My money, my money.  All he has from his money are three things; what he ate and perished, or what he wore and ruined or what he gave and kept.  All else, he will go and leave behind”.  (M: Zohd; 4)
<br />Whatever the son of Adam does of evil deeds, he will hope not to see on the Day of Resurrection, as Allah the Highest said: “THE DAY WHEN EVERY SOUL WILL FIND WHATEVER GOOD IT HAS DONE PRESENT, AND WISHES IT IS A LONG DISTANCE FROM WHATEVER EVIL IT HAS DONE.  ALLAH WARNS YOU OF HIMSELF, AND ALLAH IS KIND TO THE SLAVES”.  (S: 3 A: 30)
<br />As for the good deeds, they remain, increase and multiply with Allah the Highest, even if we forget about them, they remain for us, giving us hope in Allah’s Mercy, without which no one can gain entry to Paradise.  
<br /><br />We ask Allah to be of those whom Allah embraces with His Mercy and admits to His Paradise.  Amen.

<br /><br />Allah the Highest said: “TAKE FROM THEIR EXCESS MONEY, AND UPHOLD GOOD TRADITIONS, AND TURN YOUR BACK TO THE IGNORANT”.  (S: 7 A: 199)
<br />In this Ayah is a command to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and the Muslims in general to turn their backs to the ignorant.  So what is it to turn your back to the ignorant?
<br />It is to ignore them and not to enter into an argument or a quarrel with them, physical or verbal.  The Muslim should be above that, should leave the ignorant and turn his back to him and go.  This protects the dignity of the Muslim and shows his strength for Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “The strong is not the person who can overpower others physically, but the strong is the one who can control himself when angry”.  (M:Ber;107 &amp; B:Adab;102)
<br />The prophets and messengers prayer and peace upon them all were not argumentative, particularly with the ignorant.  What they said was decisive.  Allah the Highest said about His prophet Dawood (David) peace be upon him: “WE STRENGTHENED HIS KINGDOM, AND WE GAVE HIM WISDOM AND THE DECISIVE WORDS”.  (S:38 A:20)
<br />When the king of Egypt argued with Ibrahim, the father of the prophets prayer and peace upon him, Ibrahim did not argue but close the argument with a decisive statement as we were told in Baqarah:  “DID YOU NOT SEE HE WHO HAD A DISPUTE WITH IBRAHIM CONCERNING HIS LORD, AS IBRAHIM SAID: “MY LORD IS HE WHO GIVES LIFE AND DEATH”. HE SAID: “I GIVE LIFE AND DEATH”. IBRAHIM SAID: “BUT ALLAH BRINGS THE SUN FROM THE EAST, YOU BRING IT FROM THE WEST”. THE DISBELIEVERS WAS CONFOUNDED, AND ALLAH DOES NOT GUIDE THE UNJUST EVIL DOERS”.  (S:2 A:258)
<br />And of turning our backs to the ignorant not to sit down with them while they are insulting Allah the Highest, his books and messengers and prophets.  Allah the Highest said: “WE SENT DOWN UPON YOU IN THE BOOK THAT IF YOU HEAR ALLAH’S AYAHS DISBELIEVED IN AND MOCKED, DO NOT SIT DOWN WITH THEM UNTIL THEY TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE LIKE  THEM.  ALLAH WILL GATHER THE HYPOCRITES AND THE DISBELIEVERS ALL TOGETHER IN THE HELL-FIRE”.  (S:4 A:140)
<br />This is what all the prophets and messengers prayer and peace upon them all did with the ignorant, and this is what the believers should do.  Turning our backs to them shows them to be insignificant and not important, not attracting attention to them, and in the mean time keeping the believer dignified and the faith honoured.
<br /><br />Allah’s prayer and peace be upon Mohamed and upon his family and companions.

<br />(Prophet’s Life)
<br /><br />Introduction
<br /><br />Serah means biography of a person in Arabic.  It is generally agreed, at least among the Muslim Arabs that when the word is used alone, it means the biography or life of Allah’s messenger, Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.
<br />There are many aspects to of Allah’s messenger’s life to study, which include:
<br />-	The culture and environment in which he was born and had to preach his message.
<br />-	His family and its history.
<br />-	His childhood and family environment in which he grow up.
<br />-	The family he established through his marriage, including his children.
<br />-	His struggle to spread Islam over 23 years.
<br />-	All the social, political, economic, cultural, religious and other change which took place in his life in Arabia and in other countries and nations due to his message and the example he gave to people.  For he is the last prophet and messenger to be sent.
<br />All these factors as well as others interacted and affected each other.
<br />I relied on the most reliable and authenticated references, which included:
<br />1-	Serah by Ibn Is, haq and Ibn Hesham.
<br />2-	Albedaya wa Al-Nehaya (the beginning and the end) Ibn Kathir.
<br />3-	History by Tabari.
<br />4-	History by Ibn Saad.
<br />I shall endeavor to publish the messenger’s life history in small episodes or parts, to be more easily readable.  Allah willing, it shall be published in both Arabic and English.
<br />I ask Allah the Highest His Help and Guidance so that I may be able to shed some light on the life of our prophet and messenger prayer and peace upon him, who has been sent as a Mercy to mankind and Bounty to the believers.  Amen.

<br />Prophet’s life 1
<br /><br />Prayer and peace is upon the last of Allah’s prophets and messengers, Mohamed son of Abd Allah son of Abd Al-Motaleb son of Hashem.  The man Allah the Highest honoured with His message and honoured and blessed the Muslim Nation by being his followers, who believe and follow his message and Allah willing will qualify for his intercession on the Day of Judgement.
<br />I am starting the narration of the biography of Mohamed prayer and peace upon him from before the birth of his father Abd Allah Ibn (son of) Abd El-Motaleb.  I hope that in the course of my narration the reader will get an idea and feel for his family background as well as the different aspects of the life at the Arabian Peninsula at the time.
<br /><br />Makah:
<br />There was no life or civilization at the site of Makah, although this is the site Allah the Highest allocated for the Sacred Mosque (Kabba).  It was said that the Kabba was built by Angels, and it was said that it was built by Adam peace upon him.  However, the most reliable account is the one we have in the Quran telling us that the Kabba was built by Ibrahim and Ismail.
<br />Allah the Highest commanded His prophet and messenger Ibrahim to take his new wife Hajar and their baby son Ismail to the site of the Sacred Mosque and leave them there, where there was not water or plants.  Ibrahim did what he was commanded, and prayed to Allah the Highest for them saying: “OUR LORD, I LEFT OF MY OFFSPRING IN A VALLEY WITH NO PLANTS BY YOUR SACRED HOUSE, OUR LORD SO THAT THEY MAY BE STEADFAST IN SALAH; LET PEOPLE’S HEARTS BE DRAWN TO THEM AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE PRODUCE SO THAT THEY MAY GIVE THANKS”.  (S: 14 A: 34)
<br />When water ran out, Hajar kept running between two small hells called Safa and Marwa to look out for a passing caravan or traveler to help her and her suckling baby Ismail with water or food.  Allah the Highest sent Gabriel peace upon him who scratched the surface of the earth, then the water of Zamzam gushed out; and it is still gushing with force up till this day.
<br />Now Hajar and her baby Ismail had the most important element for life, water, and in abundance.   People settle where there is water, therefore people began to come and want to settle around Zamzam, and life began and the town of Makah gradually formed.
<br />Ibrahim peace upon him used to visit his wife Hajar and his son Ismail in Makah and spend time with them.  When Ismail grow up and was about to walk around with his father every where, Allah the Highest subjected Ibrahim and Ismail to a very hard test of obedience.  He showed Ibrahim a vision that he is slaughtering his son Ismail, and the vision of the prophet is a true revelation from Allah the Highest.  “WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO WALK AROUND WITH HIM HE SAID: “MY SON, IS SAW IN A VISION THAT I AM SLAUGHTERING YOU, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK?  HE SAID: “O FATHER, DO AS YOU ARE COMMANDED, ALLAH WILLING YOU WILL FIND ME PATIENT”.  (S: 37 A: 102)
<br />After this test to Ibrahim and Ismail, Allah the Highest commanded Ibrahim to build the Kabba with his son Ismail, and again they obeyed the command without hesitation.  “AND AS IBRAHIM RAISES THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSE AS WELL AS ISMAIL, OUR LORD ACCEPT FROM US, FOR YOU ARE HEAR AND KNOW EVERY THING”.  (S: 2 A: 127)
<br />It was a hard task to build such a big building of stone in the desert, particularly as the Kabba was even larger then than it is now, and it does not seem that they got much help.
<br />Then Allah the Highest gave the command to Ibrahim peace upon him to call upon people to come for Hajj.  One might say: and how could he reach every one?  Ibrahim peace upon him duty was to call, and Allah the Highest delivered the message to people’s ears and hearts.
<br />Since then, Hajj started to Makah from every where.  People travelled to Makah walking or carried by camels, horses, donkeys, etc.  Nowadays they travel by Airplanes, ships, coaches and cars.  The Arabs went on glorifying the Kabba, and the rites of Hajj we follow now are the same we practice today.  Most of the Arabs went on worshipping Allah the Highest on the Religion of Ibrahim peace upon him.
<br />Makah became the most important and most respected town in Arabia, and Zamzam water people there and those who go on Hajj.  Makah enjoyed more prosperity and security more than any one else because of the presence of the Kabba.  This was the answer of the Dawaa of Ibrahim for his wife Hajar and son Ismail to provide them with food and water and people to live around them in the desert where he was told to leave them.

<br /><br />Marriage of Ismail peace upon him:
<br />Allah’s prophet Ismail the son of Ibrahim got married and lived in Makah.  His father Ibrahim used to visit him frequently.  Ibrahim travelled to visit Ismail on one occasion to find Ismail away but his wife at home.  Ismail’s wife welcomed her husband’s father, but she went on complaining to him about the difficulties they have in making a living and making ends meet, and that they do not have enough food and are in need.
<br />Ibrahim left before the return of Ismail from his travels, but he left him a message with his wife saying: “Change your door step”.  When Ismail returned, his wife gave him the message, which he told her to have meant that his father is telling him to divorce her, which he did.
<br />Ismail remarried, and after some time Ibrahim travelled to visit his son Ismail peace upon them, and again Ismail was travelling away.  Ismail’s wife welcomed her husband’s father.  When he asked her about their life, she thanked Allah for having all they need, and for plenty of provisions.  Ibrahim peace upon him left before the return of his son peace upon him and left him a message saying: “Fix your door step firmly”.  When Ismail returned and his wife told him about his father’s visit and the message he left for him, he told her that the message meant for him to hang on tight to her and not let her go.
<br />Ismail peace upon him lived in Makah, had a number of children and his children and their offspring spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and beyond.  Of his offspring was a man called Abd Allah who had one child son called Mohamed the son of Abd Allah.
<br />Ibrahim peace upon him had another son from his other wife, Sarah, the prophet Isaac peace upon him.  Isaac had a prophet son, Jacob peace upon him who is also called “Israel”.  From him came all the prophets of the Children of Israel up to Yehia (John the Baptist) and Jesus peace upon them.  There are no prophets or messengers between the Jesus peace upon him and Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />Idle worshipping starting: 
<br />The Arabs continued to worship Allah the Highest only on the Religion of Ibrahim peace upon him.  They used to go to Pilgrimage and Omrah as Ibrahim taught them, but then Idolatry and idle worshipping began gradually to creep into their religion.  Each tribe made itself an Idle to worship, which they claimed to be a way of drawing them nearer to Allah.  Then idles were place around and even inside the Kabba, until they reached over 360 Idles.
<br />Perversion of the rites of Hajj took place too.  An Idle was placed by the Safa and another by the Marwa.  Some people would do the Tawaf naked.  Others go to Hajj without food, saying that the guests of Allah, and then depend on people’s charity to them.  Some tribes like Qurish would not stand in Arafat.
<br />This way, many of the rites of Hajj and Omrah were altered, although Hajj continued every year the same time and in the same places as Ibrahim peace upon him did.
<br /><br />The Other Houses:
<br />The Arabs built houses similar to the Kabba in various parts of the Arab Peninsula.  They used to visit, glorify and go around them.  They also appointed keepers to look after them, and they also offered it offerings.  Yet, these houses were respected and glorifies out of respect to the Kabba, as if they were franchises of the Kabba.
<br />Qurish and Kenanah had a house called Al-Azy.
<br />Thaqeef had a house in Taef called Al-Lat.
<br />Awse and Khazrag in Yathrib had a house by the sea called “Menah”.
<br />Daws had a house called Zo Al-Khalsa
<br />Tae had a house called Felse.
<br />For the Yemen there was a house called Ream in Sanae.
<br />Bani Rabeae had a house called Redaa.
<br />Bakr and Talaab had a house called Zo Al-Kabaat.
<br />These houses were like branches or franchises of the Kabba, from which they had their status and prestige.
<br />These Idles and houses became the cornerstone of the religion, their pleasure was sought and gift and sacrifices were offered to them.  Each Idle and house had its faithful and those who seek and believe in its powers and blessings.  
<br />Idolatry also created an industry and business.  There were those who made Idles from various materials like stone, wood or metal for people to place in their houses or otherwise.  Some would keep a small copy to take with them on their travels.  A Muslim man told us that during Idolatry had had his favorite idle made of compressed dates to carry with him while travelling.  He ran out of food in the desert and had to eat his favorite idle.
<br />There were also priests for each idle, who will accept the gifts, offerings or sacrifices for the idle, also conduct prayers for different reasons like having wealth, healing for the sick or having children etc.  There was a sizable business and trade taking place around these idles and houses.  It is understandable that those benefiting from this trade would not find the idea of one God instead of hundreds appealing.
<br />Certainly the Omrah and Hajj floured after Islam, and the removal or the Idles and the false houses.  There is so much demand on Hajj and Omrah, to the extend that the responsible Authorities had to limit and restrict the overall numbers of people going on Hajj or Omrah at any one time as well as the number of Muslims going from each country worldwide.
<br />Thanks to Allah.

<br />The Elephant
<br />Abyssinia (Ethiopia) invaded Yemen at the south west corner of the Arabian Peninsula.  Abyssinia’s religion was Christianity.  When they saw the status of the Kabba amongst the Arabs, they decided to build a very large and grand church well decorated and ornamented to attract the Arabs instead of the Kabba built by Ibrahim peace upon him, and to attract them to Christianity.
<br />This scheme gave some results in some parts of Yemen, however, not in the rest of Arabia, which made the Abyssinian kind unhappy.  He was made even unhappy and indeed angered by someone defecating in this church.  
<br />The Abyssinian king was called “Abraha” and his nick name was “Al-Ashram”, meaning the one with a cut lip.  He sustained this injury in his fight over the thrown with another military general.  Abraha obviously won.  Abraha raised a large army of some sixty thousand soldiers, and to put fear into the hearts of the Arabs and to help destroy the Kabba he also had a very large elephant with the army, and they marched aiming to reach and destroy the Kabba.
<br />Some of the Arab tribes tried to resist Abraha and his army, but it was minor resistance compared to the army of Abraha, and the Arabs never tried to raise a big united army (Just like nowadays).  
<br />A man called Zo Nafar in Yemen gathered some men around him and tried to fight Abraha’s army, but they were easily defeated and Zo Nafar was taken prisoner.  
<br />In an area called “Khatham” a man called Nofil Ibn Habib lead an army to fight the Army of Abraha, but again he lost and was taken prisoner and was forced to lead the army of Abraha through the Arabian Desert. 
<br />When Abraha and his army went past Altaef, the people of Al-Taef who belonged to a tribe called Thaqif went out in a peaceful demonstration asking Abraha not to destroy their house, Al-Lat and he did not destroy it.
<br />At the time in Makah, its leader and richest man too was a man called Abd Al-Motaleb Ibn Hashem, who was the paternal grandfather of Allah’s messenger Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.   Abd Al-Motaleb real name was ‘Shyba’ which mean grey haired.  They thought that if would be a good omen for them to live long.  Shayba had a paternal uncle called Motaleb.  
<br />When Shyba’s father Hashem died, his mother took him and left Makah to Yathrib (Medina now) where her family lived, and she brought his up them.  When he approached puberty, his uncle Motaleb went to Yathrib to collect him to be brought up with his father’s family.  When he was seen bringing a young boy with him when he entered Makah, the Makans thought the Motaleb bought a slave boy, and Shyba was called Abd Al-Motaleb, meaning the slave of Motaleb.  This nick name stayed with him all his life.
<br />When the army of Abraha reached the outskirts of Makah, the army camped outside and waited.  Abraha sent to the Makans telling them that he does not wish to fight or kill them, but only to destroy the Kabba.  The people of Makah left their town and stayed in the mountains and valleys around it.  
<br />While the army was outside Makah, they took any animals they found that can be useful for them to eat or carry things, and of what they took were two hundred camels belonging to Abd Al-Motaleb.
<br />Abd Al-Motaleb went to Abraha’s camp and asked to see him.  Abraha thought that Abd Al-Motaleb went to speak to him and beg him not to destroy the Kabba, but he did not.  Abd Al-Motaleb asked Abraha to give him his camels back, and Abraha was rather surprised about this.  When Abraha expressed his astonishment that Abd Al-Motaleb asked for the camels and not the safety of the Kabba, Abd El-Motaleb said: “The camels are mine, I am their lord, as for the house, it has a Lord who will protect it”.  Abraha gave Abd El-Motaleb the two hundred camels.
<br />Abd Al-Motaleb returned to Makah and told its people to leave the town to the mountains and valleys around.  He went to the Kabba and kept praying for help against the army of Abraha.
<br />In the morning, the army of Abraha prepared to march into Makah, they started marching, but the elephant refused to march in this direction.  They tried pulling him, hitting him or poking him with an iron rode, but he still would not march towards Makah.  The strange thing was than if they tried to get him marching towards Yemen or any direction other than Makah, he would march, indeed run.
<br />Then Allah the Highest sent flocks of birds, each carrying three stones, one in it’s peak and two in its feet.  They throw these stones on the army and they killed the person they hit.  The effect was devastating, and the army started running away towards Yemen.  Abraha was badly injured, and he even lost some of his finger, but he was carried to Sanaa, the capital of Yemen where he died few days later.
<br />Allah the Highest mentioned this even in the Quran in Sorah Al-Feel (the Elephant) which says: 
<br />IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST MERCIFUL THE COMPASSIONATE
<br />DID YOU NOT SEE WHAT YOUR LORD DID TO THE PEOPLE OF THE ELEPHANT * DID HE NOT MAKE THEIR PLOTTING GO ASTRAY * AND HE SENT THEM FLOCKS OF BIRDS * STONING THEM WITH BAKED CLAY * AND HE MADE THEM LIKE DRY, BROKEN, WIND BLOWN PLANT”.  (S: 105)
<br />This Sorah was sent down some forty years after the event, which mean that it was still very well remembered, and there were many eye witnesses of the event still alive.  Mohamed Ibn Is, haq narrated that Aysha Allah’s messenger’s wife said: “I saw the person who lead the elephant and its keeper, blind and invalids, begging people for food”.
<br />As a result, Makah became of greater prestige and esteem among the Arabs; no one would dare to attack it or its caravans travelling in summer northwards, and travelling in winter southwards, for trade and to bring food to Makah.  Allah the Highest said about this:
<br />IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST MERCIFUL THE COMPASSIONATE
<br />THE COVENANT OF SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR QURISH * THEIR SAFETY AND SECURITY IN THE WINTER AND SUMMER TRIPS * LET THEM WORSHIP THE LORD OF THIS HOUSE * WHO FED THEM AFTER HUNGER AND SECURED THEM AFTER FEAR.
<br />Qurish and Makah still enjoy this security and prestige to this day, and will continue Allah willing, until the Day of Resurrection.

<br />The Prophet Is Born
<br /><br />During the year in which the army of Abraha with the Elephant marched to Makah, an orphan child was born to Amana the Daughter of Wahb, Abd Allah’s young widow.  He was named Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah Ibn Abd El-Motaleb Ibn Hashem.
<br />Let us return back to the past for a little while.
<br />The Kabba was attended to and looked after by Allah’s prophets, Ibrahim and Ismail, peace upon them.  Then the children of Ismail carried on doing the same, one generation after another, until it was taken over by a man called Modad Ibn Amro Al-Gorhmy.  His tribe Garham became in charge of Makah, and then many of the descendants of Ismail left Makah and went elsewhere.
<br />Garham were unjust and took the money and offerings given to the Kabba.  The two tribes of Bakr and Khozaa decided to fight them.  They defeated Garham who left Makah and went to Yemen from which they came originally.  However, before leaving Makah the buried the well of Zamzam and the Corner stone and two gold deer were inside the Kabba.
<br />They tribe of Khozaa went on looking after the Kabba and being in charge of its keep.  The last man to have done that was a man called Holil.  A man of the line of Ismail called “Qusi Ibn Kelab” married Holil’s daughter.  Qusi had many children and over the years he had a great wealth.  Holil died and Qusi wanted the honour or looking after the Kabba to be his and in the line of Ismail again.  A conflict arose between Qusi and the other two tribes of Bano Bakr and Khozaa.
<br />Fighting started but it went out of hand, they all agreed to seek the judgement of one of the wise Arab, who ruled for Qusi.  Qusi then had all the honour and everything to do with the Kabba, its keep, its key, feeding those on Hajj, watering them, had the banner of Qurish and Qurish counsel was to be held in his house and in his presence, and for that he built a special house called “Dar El-Nadwa”.  Qusi became the king of Makah.
<br /><br />The Well of Zamzam:
<br />Of the children of Qusi was a man called “Abd Manaf” and of the children of Abd Manaf was “Abd El-Motaleb”, the grandfather of Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.  Abd El-El-Motaleb was an honourable and generous man.  He became the chief in Makah and had the honour of feeding and watering the pilgrims.  He was well liked and respected among his people.
<br />One day while dosing off by the Kabba in its shade, heard in his sleep a caller.  This went on for three days and on the fourth the caller called him in his sleep and said to him to dig for Zamzam, which never runs out and told him the exact location of the well.  
<br />Abd El-Motaleb took his only son called Al-Hareth and went to dig for the well of Zamzam at the described location.  The surprise was that he found it, but then, the people of Makah wanted their share in the well, but he refused.  They decided to go to a woman priest of the idles, to rule in this dispute.  This woman’s place was near sham (Jordon and Syria, Lebanon now). 
<br />On their journey but before getting there, Abd El-Motaleb and his companions ran out of water, while those from other tribes accompanying them had water, but refused to give any to Abd El-Motaleb and his company.  They decided that every man should dig his grave and site waiting for his death, yet suddenly, Abd El-Motaleb decided not to die without doing his best and he got up and rode his camel.  When his camel got up, water burst from under its hove.  Abd El-Motaleb drank and invited every one else to drink and carry what they can of water.  At this point, every one acknowledged Abd El-Motaleb sole right to the well of Zamzam and they said to him: “Allah has ruled for you against us Abd El-Motaleb.  Indeed He who watered you in this dry desert is the same as he who gave you Zamzam, return safely to your well”.  And they all returned to Makah.  
<br />When Abd El-Motaleb saw what happened to him, he vowed that if he has ten children boys and they reach the age when they can defend him, he will sacrifice one of them.  Indeed, when he had 10 boys and the youngest was about 18, he gathered them all and went to the Kabba to fulfill his vow.  They made a draw between them and it came out on Abd Allah.  
<br />Abd El-Motaleb took Abd Allah to slaughter him by the idles; Esaf and Naela, but the people of Makah went and stopped him.  They did not want Abd El-Motaleb to set a precedent that a man may sacrifice one of his children.
<br />They eventually agreed to go to a priest fortune teller in Khyber.  They told her what happened and next day she told them to make a draw between Abd Allah and a man’s ransom, if the draw came on Abd Allah, they increase the ransom by another man’s ransom which was ten camels at the time, until the draw comes on the camels.  
<br />They all went to Makah and kept drawing lots between Abd Allah and the camels until it reached a hundred camels, then the draw came on the camels.  Abd El-Motaleb insisted on repeating the draw three times and it came on the camel before accepting the result of the draw.  He slaughtered the hundred camels and left them for man and beast to eat.
<br />Abd El-Motaleb took his son Abd Allah to Wahb bin Abd Manaf bin Zahrah who was the chief of Bani Zahrah and proposed to Wahb’s daughter Amana for Abd Allah.  The marriage between the two noble young people took place.  Amana became pregnant and soon after Abd Allah travelled in a trading Caravan to Sham.
<br />While Amana was pregnant she saw a number of visions:
<br />She saw light coming out of her illuminating the palaces of Basra in Sham.
<br />She heard a voice telling her: “You are carrying the noblest man of this nation.  When he is born say: I seek the protection of the one and only from the evil of every envious, and call him Mohamed”.
<br />Sadly, Abd Allah Ibn Abd El-Motaleb, Amana’s husband fell ill during the journey and died before the birth of the child.  It is said that the caravan left him with his maternal uncles in Yathrib (Medina now) when he was ill, and there he died and was buried.
<br />One can see that all that happened of the ransom for Abd Allah, was just to have Allah’s will fulfilled, and for Mohamed to born out of this decent and from the womb of Amana Bint Wahb.  Indeed, Allah’s will is always fulfilled. 
<br /><br />Birth of Mohamed prayer and peace upon him: 
<br />When Amana gave birth, she sent to Abd Al-Motaleb to tell him that he had a grandson.  Abd El-Motaleb went to see his grand son, and Amana told him what saw and heard while carrying him.  He called him Mohamed, which was not a common name at the time, and he carried him to the Kabba where he stood praying and thanking God for him, then took him back to his mother Amana.
<br />Hassan Ibn Thabet, a man lived in Yathrib (Medina) was 7-8 years older than Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, who was a poet, and was called Allah’s messenger poet, he said: “I was a grown up boy of seven, understanding what I hear.  I heard a Jew calling out on the roofs of Yathrib saying: ‘Jewish people, Jewish people’.  When they gathered around him he said to them: What is the matter.  He said: “The Star of the birth of Mohamed appeared today”.
<br /><br />The Wet-Nurse: 
<br />Abd El-Motaleb looked for Wet-Nurse to breast feed his grandson Mohamed as the noble of Makah used to do at the time.  They used to give their infants to be breast fed by the women in the desert tribes to feed them and to live the first years of their lives in the desert with its clean air.  Also to learn their first words in the pure Arabic tongue of the desert.
<br />Halima Bin Abi Zaob from a tribe called “Bani Saad” went with other women from her tribe to Makah looking for infants to breast feed them.  They used to earn a living by breast feeding the children of the noble and well off in Makah, each according to his means.  Halima carried her suckling infant on the back of a thin and weak donkey, which kept falling behind the small caravan.  
<br />The small caravan arrived to Makah and Halima arrived late because of her donkey. When Halima arrived, she found that every woman already had an infant to breast feed, and the only one left was that orphan infant she did not also want, as she did not expect his grandfather to give her much, it was usually the fathers who were generous to the wet-nurse.  Halima decided to go back to take this orphan infant Mohamed instead of going back home empty handed.
<br /><br />Blessing:
<br />As soon as Halima took the infant Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah and put him to her breast, her empty breasts filled with milk.  She fed Mohamed until he was full, and then fed her baby until he was full too, and they both slept.
<br />Halima’s husband who accompanied her on the journey went to look at his female camel, and to his surprise he found her adder full of milk.  He milked her and he and Halima had a good drink of mild and slept comfortably.
<br />On the way back home, Halima was carrying her two babies on the back of her donkey, to her surprise her donkey was the fastest one of the caravan.
<br />It was a dry year, with very little rain.  There was little water in the wells, and little grass for the animals to feed on.  Halima and her husband had few sheep, like many of the Arabs at the time.  Their sheep use to go out grassing, and return fed and watered and with milk in their adders, unlike the other sheep which returned thirsty, hungry and with dry milk.
<br />Halima and her husband realized that they were blessed by this orphan infant Mohamed since she took him.  Therefore, when reached the age of 2 and she weaned him; she took him back to his mother in Makah, but hoping to keep his with her for longer.  There was a disease spreading in Makah at the time, which made Amana decide to let Halima keep Mohamed for longer.
<br /><br />Washing Mohamed’s Heart:
<br />Few months after the return of Mohamed with Halima and while he was playing out with his milk brother and other children; his milk brother ran panicking to his parents.  He saw two men in white cloths took his milk brother Mohamed and cut his chest open.  They something like a clot out and said: “This was what Satan can get through with you”, and then they washed his heart with Zamzam Water, in a gold basin.  The children thought that Mohamed was killed, but when Halima reached him, he was well, but just looked pale.  (Muslim)
<br />Anas Ibn Malik who served Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said:  “I used to see the mark of a stitch in his chest”.
<br />Halima feared for him then, and decided and her husband to take him back to his mother.

<br />In Allah’s Care – Getting Married
<br /><br />The child Mohamed the son of Abd Allah lived with his mother Amana the daughter of Wahb after returning from the care of Halima and her family.  This orphan child lived under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather Abd El-Motaleb who was the chief of Makah, and who had a soft spot for this particular grandson.  
<br />Abd El-Motaleb sons used to prepare a place for him to sit and rest in the shad of the Kabba, and they never sat on his place out of respect.  However, when the grandson Mohamed wants to sit there and they wanted to stop him, Abd El-Motaleb will let him and will give a great deal of affection and attention.
<br /><br />The Death of Amana:
<br />When Mohamed was 6 years old, his mother Amana took him on a tribe to Yathrib (Medina) to visit his relatives on her mother’s side of Bani Adi Ibn Najar and she took with her a woman servant called Om Aymen.   Om Aymen said: “One day I found two men of the Jews of town (Yathrib-Medina) and they said to me: Let Ahmed come out for us to look at.  He came out and they looked at him all around, then one said to the other: This is the prophet, and here is where he will migrate to, and there will be a great deal of killing and war prisoner taking”
<br />When his mother Amana heard about this, she feared for his safety and decided to take him and Om Aymen and leave and return to Makah.  On the way Amana fell ill and soon died in the desert.  Om Aymen and Mohamed buried her at a place called Al-Abwa, and continued their journey to Makah.  Mohamed left Makah an orphan without a father, and returned an orphan without father or mother, and he was only six years of age.
<br />Mohamed lived under the care of his grandfather and Abd El-Motaleb Ibn Hashem, who was an old man then and died 2 years later when Mohamed was eight years old.  This was eight years following the incident of the Elephant.
<br /><br />His Uncle’s Guardianship:  
<br />After the death of Abd El-Motaleb, Mohamed’s grandfather, he went into the care of his uncle Abu Taleb. Abu Taleb and Abd Allah Mohamed’s father were brothers to the same father and mother.  Their mother was called Fatima Bent Amro.
<br />Abu Taleb was a very kind and loving father to his orphan nephew Mohamed, and his wife was similar.  He was not kind and loving to Mohamed as an orphan boy only, but this continued into Mohamed’s adulthood and until Abu Tale’s death.  Of the kindness of Abu Taleb to Mohamed was when Abu Taleb was travelling north to Syria for trade, Mohamed cried and sobbed to see his uncle departing, so much that Abu Taleb decided to take Mohamed with him on this tribe, in which some interesting events took place.
<br /><br />Bahera the Monk:
<br />The caravan travelled from Makah northwards and on the way they stopped at an area called Basra near a monastery of a monk called Bahera.  They often passed by him, without seeing Bahera.   This time Bahera looked at the caravan resting by the monastery, and saw that boy Mohamed sitting under a tree, and the branches of the tree coming down and around him to shade him.
<br />Bahera prepared food and asked every one in the caravan to come, and that no one should stay behind.  It is said that the caravan left Mohamed behind with the camels, but Bahera insisted that Mohamed should join them. 
<br />When Mohamed came, Bahera rose to receive him, put his arm around him and sate him down to eat.  He asked Mohamed: “Tell me by the Lat and Oza about the things I shall ask you about”.  Mohamed said: “Do not ask me by the Lat and Oza, for by Allah I do not hate any thing more than them”.  Bahera said: “Then by Allah, answer my questions”. Mohamed said: “Ask what you like”.  He went on asking him many questions about his back ground and life, and then he looked at his back and found the “seal of prophecy” between his shoulders (this was a birth mark on his back)
<br />Bahera went to Abu Taleb and asked him about Mohamed.  Abu Taleb first said: “Mohamed is my son”.  Bahera said: “This boy’s father is could not be alive”.  Abu Taleb said: “Well, he is my nephew”.  Bahera said: “What happened to his father?”  Abu Taleb said: “Died while his mother was pregnant”.  Bahera said: “You told me the truth, take your nephew home soon”.  
<br />Abu Taleb rushed to finish his business selling his goods and returning home with Mohamed.
<br /><br />Allah’s Care:
<br /> Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah grow up in Allah’s care, protected from all that the people at the time used to do or Idle worshiping, Adultery, drinking intoxicants, lying and all ill deeds.  He became known for his honesty, truthfulness, trustfulness and general decency, so much that he his people gave him the title “Amen” and he was known by it (it means honest and trustworthy).
<br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him mentioned some of the occasions in which Allah the Highest looked after him, he said: “I was with other boys in Qurish playing and carrying stones to play with, and all of us lifted his cloak to put by his neck to carry the stones.  While I was going with them, some one I did not see hit me and said: Pull your cloak down”  so I pulled it down, and went on playing carrying the stones with my cloak down while the other boys did not.
<br />It is also reported that while Mohamed was young and was working as a Sheppard, he wanted to see what the people in Makah do while they had good time.  He asked another boy to mind his sheep and went to see.  As soon as he sat down, he fell asleep to wake up in the morning.  He tried to do the same again, and again he slept, then he did not go again.  This was part of Allah’s care for him from a young age, keeping him away from sinning and preparing him for prophecy and its duties.
<br /><br />The battle of Fujar (meaning wicked doers):
<br />This is a battle which took place between Qurish and Kenanah on one side and Qise Elan on the other.   It was called this name because it was the result of a man killing another during the sacred month.  Mohamed the son of Abd took part in this battle when he was between 14 and 15 years old, he said: “I used to protect my uncles from the arrows”.  His side (Qurish and Kenanah) won the battle.
<br /><br />Marrying Khadija:
<br />She is Khadija the daughter of Khowayled the son of Asad.  She was a rich and noble woman in Makah.  She used to hire men to trade for her, for a share of the prophet.  When she heard about Mohamed’s character, honesty and truthfulness, she asked him to trade for her in Sham with her money, and that she will giving the highest rate she gives a man, and he agreed.  He travelling with her trade accompanied with a servant man of hers called Misarah.  
<br />Mohamed sold the goods he took from Makah and with the money he bought goods to bring to Makah.  Throughout the journey, Misarah noticed how honest he is in trading and how people liked him.  At the end of the transaction, Mohamed made a good profit, it was said that he doubled Khadija’s money.  Misarah also noticed during the journey that a cloud always shaded Mohamed while travelling.  
<br />All this made Khadija interested in Mohamed and she wished to marry him.  She asked one of her lady relatives to approach him with this proposal, and he agreed.  He was 25 and she was 40 at the time. Mohamed went to Khadija’s father Khowayled accompanied by his uncle Hamza, and her father agreed, and they got married.  She was the first woman to marry, and he did not marry another woman while she was with him, and he did not marry for 3 years following her death.  (This shows that is alright for a man to approach a good righteous man, offering him his daughter in marriage)
<br />He had all his children from her except for Ibrahim whom he had from the Egyptian lady Maria.  He had from Khadija Al-Qasim, Al-Tayeb, Zinab, Roqayah, Om-Kolthom, and Fatima.  Khadija was a very tender, loving and supportive wife to Mohamed, and he always remembered her.  When his wife Aysha was upset of him mentioning her and said: “Why do you keep remembering this old woman when Allah has given you better?” He said: “He did not”
<br /><br />Al-Fodol Alliance:
<br />This alliance was between a number of the noble families in Makah, and it was considered the most noble of the alliances the Arabs had.  
<br />The reason behind this alliance is that a man from a place called Zobid came to Makah with some good which a Makan man called Al-Ase Ibn Wael, but Al-Ase refused to give the man his money.
<br />The man from Zobid went to the Kabba and went on complaining about his predicament and composing poetry about it.  When people heard this, Zobir Ibn Abd El-Motaleb rose and he called upon the families of Hashem, Zahra, and Team, to meet at the house of Abd Allah Ibn Gedan, where they met and made a covenant to be together if any one suffer injustice in Makah, against the unjust and with the person suffering injustice until justice is being done.  Then they all went to Al-Ase Ibn wael and took the money of the man from Zobid from him and give the man his money.
<br />Mohamed was twenty years old then.   After Islam he used to say that if he was to be called upon to honour this alliance, he would.  This is because it was an alliance aiming to uphold justice and give people their rights; therefore it was in harmony with Islam.

<br /><br />Rebuilding the Kabba:
<br />When Mohamed became 35 years old, the people of Qurish decided to rebuild the Kabba which needed repair.  They also wanted to raise its height and put a root to it.  They had little wood in Makah at that time; however a ship wreck was washed out by the sea in Jeddah area, which provided the wood necessary.  They also happen to have a Christian carpenter to do the carpentry work.
<br />Inside the Kabba, there used to be a well they throw the offerings to the Kabba in.  In this well lived a snake which threatened any one who approaches her.  It used to go out and climb on the walls of the Kabba and stay there for warmth.  One day a big bird picked her of the wall of the Kabba where it used to stretch for warmth, then the people of Makah felt that Allah the Highest is pleased with what they wanted to do.
<br />They started to pull the walls of the Kabba first, and a man called Ais Ibn Omran started.  He took the first stone of the wall of the Kabba, which jumped off his hands back to its place, and then he cried: “O people of Qurish; do not spend on the building (of Kabba) except what is good and pure.  Do not use the money earned by prostitution, usury or money earned through injustice and unfairness to any one”.  (It is also reported that these words were said by Al-Waleed Ibn El-Mogirah)
<br />This shows that the Arabs before Islam considered prostitution, usury and unfair earnings to be not good or pure money.
<br />The Kabba was divided into section and every family or tribe was given a section to pull down, and then rebuild.  People were very afraid of pulling the Kabba down, and no one wanted to start, and then Al-Waleed Ibn El-Mogirah started –He was the father of Khalid Ibn El-Waleed- and went on working all day, and no one else did.  People waited overnight to see if something will happen to Al-Waleed, when they saw him going out to work next day, they started working.
<br />They pulled the building down to the foundations laid by Ibrahim peace upon him, where they found green stones the shape of a camel hump.  A man inserted his tool between two stones to separate them, but when they moved the whole of Makah shock.  Then they decided not to remove the old foundations of Ibrahim peace upon him.
<br />The tribes and families went on collecting stones for building, and every tribe or family gathered the stones for building the part they had to build.  They went one building until they finished building the Kabba, and had to put the black stone back in its place.  There was a dispute, for they disagreed as to who should have the honour of putting the black stone back in place.  They reached the point of fighting and for 4 or 5 days they were in suspense and ready to fight each other for that honour.
<br />A man by the name of Aba Omaha Ibn El-Mogirah and he was the oldest of them, suggested that they all accept the judgement of the first man to come, and the next thing there was Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah coming.  They were satisfied and pleased that he rules in this dispute.
<br />When he was asked to rule in the dispute, he asked for a sheet of cloth, on which he placed the black stone.  Then he asked a man from each tribe or family to hold the sheet and carry the sheet with the black stone who where it should be placed.  Then Mohamed took it and placed it in its place in the wall of the Kabba.  This way fighting and blood shed in Makah was prevented.
<br /><br />The Jews in the Arab Peninsula:
<br />Some Jews lived in the Arab Peninsula, who concentrated in Yathrib and Khyber.  The Christians concentrated in Najran in Yemen.  
<br />Three Jewish tribes lived in Yathrib (Medina), they were called; Bano Qurizah, Bano El-Nazer, and Bano Kinoka.  And there were two Arab tribes; Al-Awse and Al-Khazrag who were idle worshipers.  Whenever there was a conflict between the Arabs and Jews in Yathrib, the Jews used to mention that they are expecting a prophet to rise then whom they will follow and fight the idle worshipers with him.  The Jews of Yathrib mentioned this many times, so that the idle worshipping Arabs knew about it very well.
<br />It has been narrated that a Jewish man called Ibn Al-Heban went to live in Yathrib some years before Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  He was a decent character and righteous man, so much so that when it did not rain, they used to ask him to pray for rain and it rains.  He did that several times.
<br />When he was dying, he told some of the Jews youth who were with him that he left the land of sham (Syria &amp; Lebanon) and the comfortable life there because he knew of a prophet about to rise in this region; he hoped to see and follow.  He also said that this prophet will fight those who oppose him and take prisoners.  However, when Allah the Highest sent Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, they did not follow him.  When the Muslims fought and besieged the tribe of Bano Qurizah in their fortress, they remembered what they heard from Ibn Al-Heban, and they believed and became Muslims.
<br /><br />Salman the Persian: 
<br />Salman was a Persian man from a place called Asbahan.  His father was a wealthy man, and he loved Salman very much, and they were Magus (worship fire).  Salman used to worship fire and keenly attends to the fire so that it never goes out.  Salman did not leave the house often until one day his father asked him to go to their farm for some business.
<br />Salman went to the farm, and on the way he passed by a Christian church, and he heard them praying, so he went in and stayed and liked their prayer.  Salman spend the rest of the day in the church until sunset and did not go to the farm.  When he went back home, he told his father about what he did in his day, and that he thought that Christianity is better than fire worshipping and that he wanted to be Christian.  His father was very angry with him, and decided to tie him and imprison him at home.
<br />Salman managed to get a message to the Christian people, asking them to let him know whenever travelers come to them from Sham where Christianity spread then, and the time of their departure from Persia, so that he may escape and join them.  When a caravan came from Sham and was about to leave, Salman managed to untie his robes, escape and join them to Sham.
<br />Salman asked in Sham about the most knowledgeable of the Christians, and they directed him to a Bishop, whom Salman went to serve in his church to pray with him and learn from him.  Unfortunately, this bishop was dishonest, collecting charity for the poor, but keeping most of for himself, until he gathered a fortune 7 earth ware containers full of gold and silver.  Salman told the other priests, who found the treasure, crucified the bishop and stoned him.
<br />The bishop was replaced with a decent man who had a very simple life, spent his time praying.  Salman loved this bishop very much and stayed with him for a long time.  When the bishop was dying, Salman asked him to direct him to someone else to go to, and he told him about a man in Mousel (in Iraq).  After this bishop’s death and burial Salam went to the priest in Mousel. 
<br />Salman stayed with the priest in Mousel until he was dying, he asked him then to direct him to another priest and he directed him to a priest in a place called ‘Naseben”.  He went to the priest there, and he directed him before his death to a priest in “Amoryah”, and Salman went off to him.  There Salman worked and saved some money and he became the owner of some cows and sheep.  When the priest was dying and Salman asked him where to go next, the priest told him that it is the time for the appearance of a new prophet who will be from the Arab land.  He will be in a land with many palm trees, he will eat from a gift but not from charity, and will have the seal of prophecy between his should blades.  He advised him to go there and to follow the prophet when he sees him.
<br />Salman stayed in Amoryah for a while, and when he found a caravan travelling to Arabia, he agreed with them to pay them his animals for taking him over to the Arab land.  However on the way, they took his as slave, and then sold him to a Jewish man in Arabia.  This Jewish man sold Salman to his cousin who was fro the tribe of Bano Qurizah in Yathrib, and he took him there.  When Salman saw Yathrib, he knew that this is the place, and he was very pleased.
<br />Salman lived in Yathrib serving his master, and one day a cousin of his master came telling his master that the people from Aws and Khazrag are gathered in Qibaa around a man they claim to be a prophet.  When Salman heard this while he was on top of a palm tree, his body shivered.  He came down and said to his master’s cousin: “What do you say”, this angered his master who hit him hard.
<br />Salman had some dates and food, he took to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him while he was still at Qibaa and said: “I am told that you are a good man, and you have some companions who are strangers and in need.  This is something I had for charity, and I you are more deserving than others” and he gave him the food.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said to his companions: “Eat”, but he did not eat.  Salman said to himself: “This is one (sign)”
<br />Salman went and got more food, in the mean time Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him arrive at Medina.  He took the food to him and said: “I noticed that you do not eat from the charity, this is a present to honour you”.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him ate and asked his companions to eat from that food.
<br />One day, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was at Baqee follow one of his companion’s funeral, then he sate down.  Salman went and kept looking at his back trying to see the seal of prophecy.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him noticed he let his cloak slip off his back a little so that Salman may see the seal.  When Salman saw it, he went on kissing Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and crying.  Then Salman told Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him his full story.
<br />Then after the battles of Badr and Ohud, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told Salman to ask his master how much he wants for Salman’s freedom?  Salman’s master demanded 300 palm trees and forty ounces of gold, which was exorbitant.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said to his companions: “Help your brother out”.  They went on giving Salman as many young palm trees as they could, until he had 300.  Then Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him commanded Salman to dig the earth for the tree, and when he did, Allah’s messenger placed each of the three hundred young palms in the soil with his own hands, and they all lived.  This is the character Allah the Highest said about: “YOU ARE OF SUPREME CHARACTER”.
<br />Salman gave the palm trees to his Jewish master, but the gold remains to be paid.  One day a man brought Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him a piece of gold like an egg, he said: “Where is the Persian man buying his freedom?”  When he came he said to him: “Take this and pay of what you owe”, Salman said: “And what is compared to what I awe Allah’s messenger”.  He said: “Take it, Allah will make it pay for you”.  Salman took it to his master, and when weighed, it was 40 ounces, and Salman gained his freedom.
<br />Salman left the service of the Jewish man in Medina, and went to live with the Muslim.  He did not miss and took part in all the expeditions and battles with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.

<br /><br />There were some believers between the Arabs during the Idle Worshipping Era, but they were very few, of them:
<br /><br />Waraqa Ibn Nofel: 
<br /><br />He was a paternal cousin of Khadija, Allah’s messenger’s wife, and he adopted Christianity.  He was the first person Khadija told about the revelations Mohamed prayer and peace upon him received and also about seeing Gabriel peace upon him.  He did not live long after the beginning of the prophecy and mission of Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, for he was an old man then.
<br /><br />Zyd Ibn Amro Ibn Nofil:
<br /><br />He lived before Islam, but he did not worship idles or the things his people worshiped before Islam.  He did not eat the flesh of the dead animal, its blood, or from the offerings given to Idles.  He also discouraged people from killing their young daughters – some used to do that fearing that they will bring them shame-   Zyd followed the religion of Ibrahim peace upon him, and he used to prostrate to Allah the Highest.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was asked: “Should we ask Allah to forgive Zyd Ibn Amro?”   He said: “Yes for he is to be resurrected as a whole nation, just himself”.  (Byhaqy)
<br /><br />The Prophecy
<br /><br />The first signs of Prophecy that Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him experiences was the true vision.  Whenever he saw a vision, it used to be very clear like the daylight.
<br /><br />Then he was taken to solitude, until it became the thing he liked most.  He used to go out on his own to the mountains and passages around Makah.  Whenever he passed a rock or a tree, it used to greet him saying: “Peace upon you Allah’s messenger”.  He would turn right, left and behind him, to find nobody but rocks and trees. 
<br /><br />The last 5 years before his prophecy, he used to a month every year worshipping by himself at the cave of “Heraa”.  In the year during which Allah the Highest favoured him and us with His message, which is a mercy to mankind, it was during the month of Ramadan when Gabriel peace upon him went to him in the cave and said: “Read”, he answered: “I can not read” (He was illiterate).  He said: “he hugged me so hard, until I thought I was dying, then let me go and said: “Read” He said: “I can not read”.  He hugged me hard again until I thought I was dying then let me go and said: “Read”.  I said: “I can not read”.  He hugged me hard again until I thought I was dying then let me go and said: “What do I read?”  And this was only because I feared that he would do the same again.  He said: “READ IN THE NAME OF YOUR LORD WHO CREATED * HE CREATED MAN FROM A CLOT * READ FOR YOUR LORD IS THE MOST NOBLE * HE TAUGHT WITH THE PEN * HE TAUGHT MAN WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW”.  (S: 96 A: 1-5)
<br />I recited it, and he stopped and he left me, and rose up and it was as if engraved in my heart.  I went out, and then I heard a voice from the sky saying: “O Mohamed, you are Allah’s messenger and I am Gabriel”.  I looked up in the sky, and there was a man standing with his feet at the horizon saying: “O Mohamed, you are Allah’s messenger and I am Gabriel”.  I stood looking at him, neither moving forwards nor backwards.  I kept trying to look away from him, but whenever I looked in any direction in the sky, I found him.  I stayed in my place, neither moving forwards or backwards until Khadija sent her messengers looking for me, and they came up and went while I am still in my place, until he left me”.  
<br /><br />Mohamed prayer and peace upon him returned home and sate with Khadija and told her about what happened.  She said: “Be optimistic my cousin and do not be shaken, for by he who has the soul of Khadija in his hands, I hope that you are the prophet of this nation”.   She put her cloths on and went to her cousin Waraqa Ibn Nofel, who was a Christian who read both the Engeel and Torah.  She told him what Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told her, and he said: “Holy, Holy, if you told me the truth Khadija, he has seen the great archangel who used to visit Musa (Moses) and he is indeed the prophet of this nation, tell him not to be shaken and be firm”.   Khadija went back and told Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him what Waraqa told her.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him went to Kabba to do the Tawaf, and there he met Waraqa, and told Waraqa what happened with him, and Waraqa said to him: “By He who has my soul in his own hands, you are the prophet of this nation, and you have seen the great archangel who used to go to Musa (Moses)”.  Then Waraqa told him that his people are not going to believe him, they will hurt and fight him and turn him out of his home, and that if Waraqa was still alive by then, he will support him.  He kissed the head of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and went back to his home.
<br /><br />It has been narrated that Khadija asked Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to let her know whenever he sees Gabriel peace upon him, and when he came, he told her.  She asked him to sit on her left thigh, them on her right thigh, then in her lap, and he did.  Then she took her head cover off and let her dress slip a little of her shoulder, then Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told her that he went.  She told Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him that has been a devil, he would not have gone.  She believed in Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />Allah the Highest sent down many Ayahs in the Quran mentioning the beginning of the sending down of the Quran, and glorifying the night and the months during which it was sent, saying: 
<br /><br />“THE MONTH OF RAMADAN DURING WHICH THE KORAN WAS SENT DOWN, GUIDANCE TO MANKIND AND CARRYING CLEAR SIGNS OF GUIDANCE AND JUDGING RIGHT FROM WRONG.  ANY ONE OF YOU WHO SEE THIS MONTH, HE SHOULD FAST IT, AND WHOEVER IS ILL OR TRAVELLING, THEY SHOULD MAKE THE NUMBER UP AT OTHER DAYS.  ALLAH DESIRES EASE NOT HARDSHIP FOR YOU.  YOU SHOULD COMPLETE THE NUMBER OF DAYS, AND GLORIFY ALLAH FOR WHAT HE GUIDED YOU TO, SO THAT YOU MAY GIVE THANKS”.  (S: 2 A: 185)
<br /><br />And about the night the Quran was sent down, Allah the Highest:   
<br />“HA MEEM * AND THE CLEAR MANIFEST BOOK * WE SENT IT DOWN ON BLESSED NIGHT FOR WE ARE WARNING *” (S: 44 A: 1-3)
<br /><br />And Said: “WE SENT IT (THE QURAN) DOWN ON THE NIGHT OF QADR * AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE NIGHT OF QADR * THE NIGHT OF QADR IS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND MONTHS * THE ANGELS COME DOWN THEN AND SO DO THE SPIRITS WITH THEIR LORD’S PERMISSION WITH EVERY COMMAND * PEACE IT IS UNTIL THE DAWN RISES”.  (S: 97)
<br /><br />With the belief of Khadija, Allah the Highest gave his prophet and messenger prayer and peace upon him the best personal support he could have.  She did her best to comfort him and encourage him when people disbelieved and fought him.  She lightened the burden and eased the difficulties of the responsibilities of the prophecy.  
<br /><br />On an occasion, Gabriel peace upon him went to Mohamed prayer and peace upon him to deliver the greetings of Allah the Highest to Khadija.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “Khadija, this is Gabriel carrying you the Salam from you Lord”.  She said: “Allah is the Salam, from He comes the Salam and Salam is upon Gabriel”.  (Byhaqy)
<br /><br />On another occasion, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “I was commanded to give Khadija the good news that she will have a house of threads of jewels, where there is no noise and no one tires”.
<br /><br />When the Quran was sent down to Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, he went home frightened and shaking and saying: “Cover me up, cover me upon, wrap me up, and wrap me up”.  Khadija cuddled him and wrapped him up and comforted him until he calmed down.  Yet he remained frightened and shaky until Allah the Highest sent his these Ayahs:  “YOU THE WRAPPED UP MAN * RISE FOR THE NIGHT (TO PRAY) EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE LEFT OF IT * A HALF OR A LITTLE LESS * OR MORE THAN THAT AND RECITE THE QURAN WELL * FOR WE SEND YOU HEAVY WORDS”.  (S: 73 A: 1-5)
<br />And Allah the Highest also sent down: “YOU COVERED UP MAN * RISE AND WARN PEOPLE * AND GLORIFY YOUR LORD * AND PURIFY YOUR CLOTH * AND STAY WAY FROM THE IDLES AND EVIL”.  (S: 74 A: 1-5)
<br />Then revelations stopped for a while, and Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was very sad and thought that Allah the Highest abandoned him.  Allah the Highest then sent down: “BY THE MIDMORNING * AND THE NIGHT AS IT COVERS EVERY THING * YOUR LORD DID NOT ABANDON YOU AND HE DID NOT HATE YOU * AND THE HEREAFTER IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN THIS LIFE * AND YOUR LORD WILL GIVE YOU UNTIL YOU ARE SATISFIED”.  (S: 93 A: 1-5)
<br /><br />Allah the Highest protected His Book, the Quran on more than one level:
<br /><br />1-	On its way down.  Allah the Highest protected the Quran from being interfered with by the Devils or Satan on its way down, saying in Sorah Al-Jin “AND WE TOUCHED THE SKY AND WE FOUND IT FILLED WITH MANY STRONG GUARDS AND METEORITES * AND WE USED TO HAVE PLACES FOR LISTENING, BUT WHOEVER LISTENS NOW WILL FIND A METEORITE AIMING HIM”.  (S:72 A:8,9)
<br /><br />And answering those who claim that the a devil brings the Quran down to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, Allah the Highest sent down: “AND THE DEVILS DID NOT BRING IT DOWN * AND THEY SHOULD NOT AND THEY CAN NOT * AND THERE IS A BARRIER TO PREVENT THEM HEAR IT”. (S: 26 A: 210-212)
<br /><br />2-	The revelations of the Quran used to come via the Archangel Gabriel peace upon him.  When Mohamed prayer and peace upon him received it, at times it was light and mild, and other times it made him sweat on a very cold day.
<br />Mohamed prayer and peace upon him used to move his lips and tongue with Gabriel as he says the words, and that was to memorize it, until Allah the Highest told him in the Quran that he does not have to do that, for Allah the Highest will fix and clarify the for him.  “AND DO NOT MOVE YOU TONGUE WITH IT HURRY MEMORIZING IT * IT IS FOR US TO GATHER TOGETHER AND MAKE CLEAR”.  (S: 75 A: 16-17)
<br /><br />3-	Allah the Highest gave His messenger and us a guarantee that the Quran will be kept safe and intact always saying: “WE SENT DOWN THE ZEKR (QURAN) AND WE WILL PRESERVE AND PROTECT IT”.  (S:15 A:9)
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was reassured that Allah the Highest is protecting the Quran on every level.  It was carried by the archangel Gabriel, the devils could not interfere or even listen to it, it will be kept in his mind and heart, and afterwards, Allah the Highest will preserve His Book.

<br /><br />Early Muslims
<br /><br />Ali Ibn Abi Taleb:
<br /><br />Makah suffered a dry year before Islam, during which there was little water and food.  Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah went to his uncle Al-Abas Ibn Abd El-Motaleb to Abu Taleb Mohamed’s uncle and Abases brother.  He said to him that Abu Taleb has many children, so if each on of us takes a child to look after and bring up, they will ease his load a little.  They went to Abu Taleb and Mohamed took his son Ali, and Al-Abas took Jafar.  Ali was about 8 years old at the time.
<br /><br />Ali Ibn Abi Taleb was brought up in the house of his cousin Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah.  Then when Mohamed prayer and peace upon him received the message and started prophet hood, Ali saw him praying with Khadija, and he asked them what they were doing?  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told his that this is Allah’s religion and invited him to become a Muslim.  Ali wanted to consult with his father Abu Taleb first, but Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him asked him not to tell anyone.  But then, Ali believed and Abu Taleb knew about Islam and Ali becoming a Muslim, and he commanded his son to stay a Muslim and to follow Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, and at the time Ali was under the age of puberty.
<br /><br />Zyd Ibn El-Haretha:
<br /><br />Zyd was a boy of the prophet’s household before Islam since before Islam.  He was snatched as a child and sold as a slave.  He ended with Khadija’s sister, who gave him as a gift to Khadija.  When she found that her husband, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him liked him and his intelligence, she gave him the boy.  This was before Allah’s messenger’s prophecy.
<br /><br />Zyd lived in Allah’s messenger household treated as a son, meanwhile his father was looking everywhere for him.  His father, Al-Hareth was still looking for him and he had information that Zyd was in Makah, and he went there and found him to be with Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah.  Zyd’s father, Al-Hareth went to the Kabba and called out to the people there that his son is a slave with Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah, and to help him to buy his to set him free (he was afraid that the price will be put up high for him)
<br /><br />Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah (before the prophecy) came with Zyd and he told Al-Hareth that he will give Zyd the choice of going with his father or with him.   Zyd in front of every one choose to stay with Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah because of what he felt towards him and what he felt in his house hold.  Then and before the crowd, Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah set Zyd free and said that he was taking him for a son, inheriting each other (this was before the prohibition).  Then Zyd continued living in Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah and Khadija Bent Khowayled as a son.
<br /><br />When Allah the Highest started the prophecy of Mohamed prayer and peace upon him and he was with them, he believed and embraced Islam.
<br /><br />Abu Bakr:  
<br /><br />Abu Bakr was a merchant and a well liked man, known for good manners, helping people and being a good company.  He was also very knowledgeable of the families of Qurish, their origins and descent.  He also knew Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him very well.  Abu Bakr was his nick name but his real name was Ateeq and his father Abu Quhafa.
<br /><br />After receiving revelations, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told him about what happened and invited him to Islam.  Abu Bakr believed, without any hesitation, or thinking twice.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “I never called anyone to Islam who would not hesitate or pause to thing, except Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Quhafa, he did not turn away or hesitate”.  
<br /><br />Abu Bakr was the one of the best telling others about Islam, and he was the first adult man to believe, many people embraced Islam through him, of them: 
<br /><br />Othman Ibn Afan
<br />Al-Zobir Ibn Al-Awam.
<br />Abd El-Rahman Ibn Aouf
<br />Saad Ibn Abi Waqas
<br />Talha Ibn Obid Allah
<br />Abu Salama – Abd Allah Ibn Abd El-Asad.
<br />Al-Arqam Ibn Abi Al-Arqam
<br />Othman Ibn Mazoon
<br />Saed Ibn Zyd
<br />Khabab Ibn Al-Aret
<br />Omir Ibn Abi Waqas, Saad’s brother.
<br />Abd Allah Ibn Masoud
<br />Masoud Ibn El-Qari
<br /><br />Then Allah the Highest commanded his prophet and messenger to speak to and warn his close kin saying: “AND WARN YOUR CLOSE KIN * AND BE KIND TO THE BELIEVERS WHO FOLLOW YOU * BUT IF THEY DISOBEY YOU, SAY I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING”.  (S: 42 A: 214-216)
<br /><br />This was a direct command from Allah the Highest to His messenger prayer and peace upon him, and it had to be obeyed.  He started to with his close kin beyond his immediate family.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him commanded Ali Ibn Abi Taleb to slaughter a sheep and make food and drink for people, and then he invited his uncles and cousins. He did the same next day, and then next day again.  On the third day he spoke to them about Islam and what it is about, and that it is good for the good of our life and Hereafter.  
<br /><br />It was narrated that Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “O Fatema the daughter of Mohamed, O Safia the daughter of Abd El-Motaleb, I can not help you with Allah, but you can ask me for what you want of my money”.  (Muslim) 
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was worried that he might be killed if he speaks to people openly about Islam, and the message will not be delivered then.  Allah the Highest sent down a Quran reassuring his messenger prayer and peace upon him saying: “O MESSENGER, DELIVER WHAT WAS SENT DOWN TO YOU FROM YOUR LORD, AND IF YOU DO NOT, THEN YOU DID NOT DELIVER HIS MESSAGE, AND ALLAH WILL PROTECT YOU FROM PEOPLE, VERILY ALLAH DOES NOT GUIDE THE DISBELIEVING PEOPLE”.  (S: 5 A: 67)
<br /><br />He was reassured then prayer and peace upon him and went one delivering Allah’s message to people.
<br /><br />Abu Jahl tries to kill Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him: 
<br /><br />One day, Abu Jahl – his name was Al-Hakam Ibn Hesham- told his idle worshipping companions in Makah that he intends to strike Allah’s messenger’s head with a big stone while he is prostrating in his Salah at the sacred mosque, and they gave him their word that they will not stop him.
<br /><br />Next day, Abu Jahl took a large stone and sate waiting for Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to come to pray at the sacred Mosque.  He came and prayed, and when he prostrated, Abu Jahl carried the stone and went towards him until he was near, then he turned back looking pale and frightened, with his hands frozen on the stone which he then dropped.  Some men from Qurish went to him and said: “What happened to you Aba Al-Hakam?
<br />He said: “I went to do what I told you about yesterday, but when I approached, large male camel stood in my way, I have never seen another of that size and teeth, and he was about to eat me”.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said about this: “This was Gabriel, and if he came nearer, he would have taken him”.  
<br />This was an example of Allah’s protection to his messenger prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />Abu Jahl and the man from Irash: 
<br /><br />A man from Irash in Babylon went to Makah with camels to sell.  Abu Jahl bought them of him, but he did not pay the man his money.  The Man from Irash went to the sacred mosque and called out to every one that Abu Jahl bought his camels and would not pay him and to help him to get his money from Abu Jahl.
<br /><br />Some men looking for a laugh told him that the best man to get him his money is a man called Mohamed Ibn Abd Allah and they pointed him prayer and peace upon him to the man, knowing about the animosity between Abu Jahl and Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />The man from Irash went to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and told of about his problem with Abu Jahl, he got up with him going to Abu Jahl’s house, and a man from Qurish followed them.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him knocked the Abu Jahl’s door, and Abu Jahl came over looking pale.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him told Abu Jahl: “Give this man his money”, Abu Jahl said: “Do not leave I will get him his money”.  He went in, brought the money and gave it to the man from Irash.
<br /><br />The man from Irash went back to the sacred mosque and thanked those who advised him to speak to Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, which surprised them.  When they saw Abu Jahl later, they asked him what happened, and he told them that when he heard the knock on the door he felt frightened, then when he opened the door found a large male camel with large teeth, and had he refused, the camel would have devoured him.
<br /><br />This does not mean that Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him did not suffer any hurt physical and morale from the disbelievers.  He was attacked, insulted and threatened, even while praying, on a number of occasions. I will mention some of them.
<br /><br />One day, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was praying in the Sacred Mosque and there were the remains of a slaughtered animal lying not very far.  A man called Oqba Ibn Abi Maeet carried the remains and throws it on his back while he was prostrating.  He remained in this position until his daughter Fatema took it of his back.  This time he was angry and turned to that group of men saying: “Allah I ask you to take those people of Qurish, Allah I ask you to take Otba Ibn Rabae, Shayba Ibn Rabae, Abu Jahl Ibn Hesham, Oqba Ibn Abi Maet, and Omiya Ibn Khalaf”.  They were killed inn the battle of Badr, and buried in a mass grave there.  (Bukhari &amp; Muslim)
<br /><br />Bukhari reported that Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was praying by the Kabba, when Oqba Ibn Abi Maet came the put some cloth around Allah’s messenger neck to strangle him, and he did not let go until Abu Bakr rushed to Allah’s messenger’s aid and let him loose, and said a verse in the Quran : “DO YOU KILL A MAN JUST BECAUSE HE SAID: MY LORD IS ALLAH, AND HE CAME TO YOU WITH THE CLEAR SIGNS, AND IF HE IS A LIAR, THEN HE WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS LYING, BUT IF HE IS TRUTHFUL, SOME OF WHAT HE PROMISES YOU WILL AFFECT YOU, AND ALLAH DOES NOT GUIDE THOSE WHO ARE EXCESSIVE AND LIARS”.  (S: 40 A: 28)
<br /><br />On another occasion, while the noble men of Qurish, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him came to do the Tawaf.  Every time he walks past them, they say insults and unpleasant words.  On the third time he said to them: “Listen people of Qurish, by He who has my soul in his hand, I come to you with the slaughter”.
<br /><br />Next day when they met by the Kabba, they were angry from what Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said the day before and they went to him and said: “Did you say: such and such, and he says: Yes I said that.  One of them took him by the collar, when Abu Bakr went to help him saying: Are you killing a man just because he says:  Allah is my Lord.  Then they left him and went.

<br /><br />The disbelievers in Makah demanded from Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to show them some extraordinary things as a condition for their belief, such as:
<br /><br />-	To move the mountains away from Makah.
<br />-	To make the land around them flat and suitable for cultivation, so that they may grow food.
<br />-	To let there be rivers around them as in other countries.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “But I bring you what Allah sent me with, and I have delivered the message Allah has sent me with, if you accept it, this will be your good share of this life and the Hereafter, and if you reject, I will be patient and persevere with Allah’s command, until Allah rules out between us”.  
<br /><br />-	Then they asked him to let their punishment be sooner as a sign that he is truthful, or to let them see stairs rising in the heavens and him climbing up the stairs.  Then to bring back a written copy of the Quran, and to come accompanied by four Angels.
<br /><br />Imam Ahmed related: “The people of Qurish said to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him: ‘Ask your Lord to let the Hill of Safa turn into gold and we will believe for you’ He said: ‘Will you?’  They said:’ yes’.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him then asked his Lord.  Gabriel peace upon him came and said to him: “Your Lord is sending his greetings and say: “I you desire, I will turn the Safa into gold, but if any one does not believe after this, I will punish his with such punishment that no one else has even been punished with, or if you desire, I will open the gates for Mercy and Pardoning?” He prayer and peace upon him said: “But Mercy and Pardoning”.
<br /><br />And Ahmed And Nesae reported that Abd Allah Ibn Abas said: “The people of Makah asked Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to turn Safa into gold, and to turn the mountains away so that they may cultivate the land, and the answer was: “If you will give them more time, and if you will we will give them what they asked for, but if they disbelieve then, they will perish as other nations before them were destroyed?”  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: ‘I will give them more time”.  Allah the Highest then sent down the following Quran: “AND WHAT STOPPED US SENDING THE SIGNS IS THAT THE EARLIER PEOPLE REJECTED THEM, AND WE HAVE GIVEN THEMOD THE FEMALE CAMEL TO BE SEEN CLEARLY, BUT THEY DID IT WRONG, FOR WE SEND THE SIGNS ONLY TO STRIKE FEAR”.  (S: 17 A: 59)
<br /><br />It was also reported that the disbelievers in Makah also sent two of their nobles to meet the Rabbis of the Jews in Yathrib (Medina) to ask them about Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  They told them to ask him about three things, only known to a prophet: young men who were in the early times and what happened to them and a man who wondered throughout the Earth, east and west, and to ask him about the soul”
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him promised to answer them next day, but he did not say Allah willing.  He did not have any revelations to answer them with for 15 days, then Allah the Highest sent: “AND DO NOT SAY ABOUT ANY THING THAT I WILL DO THIS TOMORROW * ONLY IF ALLAH IS WILLING, AND REMEMBER YOUR LORD IF YOU FORGET AND SAY: ‘MY LORD MAY GUIDE ME TO A BETTER GUIDANCE THAN THAT”.  (S: 18 A: 23, 24)
<br /><br />Allah the Highest also sent His messenger prayer and peace upon him Quran answering their questions; first the young men of the early times, saying: “OR DID YOU THINK THAT THOSE OF THE CAVE AND THE TABLET IN WHICH THEIR NAMES AND DESCENT IS WRITTEN ARE OF OUR AMAZING SIGNS * AS THE YOUNG MEN SOUGHT SHELTER IN THE CAVE AND SAID: ‘OUR LORD, GIVE US MERCY FROM YOU AND GUIDE US TO THE RIGHT WAY IN WHAT WE ARE DOING * ……………….”  (S: 18 A: from 9)
<br /><br />And then about the man who wondered through the Earth and east and west: “AND THEY ASK YOU ABOUT THE ONE WITH TWO HORNS, SAY: I WILL RECITE SOMETHING ABOUT HIM * …..” (S: 18 A: from 83)
<br /><br />And about the soul, Allah the Highest said: “AND THEY ASK YOU ABOUT THE SOUL, SAY: THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOUL IS WITH MY LORD, AND YOU WERE GIVEN ONLY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE”.  (S: 17 A: 85) 
<br /><br />It is reported in both Bukhari and Muslim that the Jews of Medina asked Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him these questions when he migrated to Medina.  Although he gave them the right answers, yet only a few of them believed.  
<br /><br />The Torture of the Muslims
<br /><br />The disbeliever’s resistance of the spread of Islam took a new turning when they started to torture the Muslim.  Each tribe started torturing the slaves and the week of their Muslims.  They were imprisoned, flogged and left without food or water, and at times left in the extreme heat of the desert without water.  I will mention some examples:
<br /><br />Belal Ibn Rabah:  
<br /><br />Belal was a slave owned by some people from Bani Jamh, and his mother’s name was Hamamah.  Belal was very pure hearted and sincere in his faith.  Omyah Ibn Khalaf used to take his to the desert when it is very hot and place a large stone on his chest and order his to disbelieve and to leave the faith of Mohamed and worship Al-Lat and Oza, but Belal will only say: “Ahad, Ahad”  (Meaning Allah is one and only)
<br /><br />One day Abu Bakr saw his being tortured, he took him from Omyah in exchange for another slave, then Abu Bakr let him free.
<br /><br />Abu Bakr bought with his money a number of slaves, men and women who were Muslims and sat them free, of them; Belal, Emarah, Om Amees, who was blinded but Allah restored her eyesight.  Also bout a woman slave called Nahdiah and her daughter.  He also bought a woman slave from Bani Moamel, whom Omar used to flog her before he became Muslim.
<br /><br />Abu Bakr’s father Abu Kohafa used to advise him to buy the strongest men slaves, who would be able to help and protect them, however, Abu Bakr was seeking to please Allah the Highest and to his reward, therefore he bought those who suffer.  Allah the Highest sent down Quran about him saying: “AS FOR HIM WHO GIVE AND IS PIOUS * AND BELIEVE IN WHAT IS RIGHTEOUS * WE WILL EASE HIS WAY TO WHAT ID GOOD * ……….”  (S:92 A:5,6)
<br /><br />Abu Jahl was the worst in torturing the Muslims and persecuting them.  If the Muslim was strong and his family protected him him, he would verbally abuse them; otherwise, he would hit and flog.
<br />Bano Makhzoom used to take Amar Ibn Yasser and his father and his mother Somayah, they were all Muslims, and they would take them out in the midday heat and torture them.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him passed by them once and said: “Be patient and persevere family of Yasser, for your place is the Paradise”
<br />On another occasion he said: “Good news Yasser’s family, your place is the Paradise”.
<br />Abu Jahl killed Somayah with a spear penetrating her from the front.
<br /><br />The Muslims who were tortured less used to be unable to just site up due to pain, or thirst and hunger.
<br /><br />The Disbelievers hear the Quran and Prostrate
<br /><br />On another occasion, Otba Ibn Rabae went to speak to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and repeated their offer to make him their king, and the wealthiest man etc.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him listened then started to recite Sorat Foselat saying: “IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE.  IT IS SENT DOWN FROM THE MOST MERCIFUL THE COMPASSIONATE * A BOOK AND its AYAHS ARE CLEAR AND IN ARABIC ………..”
<br />Otba went on listening, put his hands on the floor behind him and rested his weight on his arms listening, until Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him finished reciting then he went back to his companions.  He told them that these words were neither poetry nor what they used to hear from the temples priests.  He advise them to leave him alone and not to harm him, then should he become stronger and prevails, they should follow him then, if he does not, then they have been saved the trouble.  They did not like what he said.
<br /><br />One night, Abu Sofian and Abu Jahl and Al-Akhnas went out each from their own houses, alone and unknown to each other, and they sat near Allah’s messenger’s house to listen to him reciting the Quran while praying.  In the morning, they saw each other and they blamed each other and promised each other not to repeat this.  The same thing happened next night and the third night.  Al-Akhnas went to Abu Sofian to ask him about what he heard, and Abu Sofian said that he heard and understood what he heard, but did not elaborate any further.  Then he went to Abu Jahl and asked him the same question, and he had the same answer.
<br /><br />Abu Sofian and Abu Jahl mocked Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him saying that didn’t Allah have found better than Mohamed to make a prophet, which upset Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  Allah the Highest then sent him a Quran saying: “AND WHEN THEY SEE YOU THEY MOCK YOU (SAYING): IS THIS WHOM ALLAH SENT TO BE A MESSENGER * HE ALMOST LEAD US AWAY FROM OUR GODS, IF WE DID NOT PERSEVERE WITH THEM, BUT THEY WILL KNOW WHEN THEY SEE THE PUNISHMENT WHO IS THE MOST MISGUIDED”  (S:25 A:41-42)
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him used to raise his voice reciting the Quran when he led his companions in Salah.  He was trying to let the disbelievers hear.  However, when they heard the Quran they used to swear at and insult the Quran.  Allah the Highest then sent him further instructions regarding reciting the Quran.  “SAY: CALL UPON ALLAH OR CALL UPON THE MERCIFUL, WHOEVER YOU MAY CALL FOR HE HAS THE GOOD NAMES, AND DO NOT RAISE YOUR VOICE RECITING THE QURAN AND DO NOT WHISPER IT AND SEEK SOMETHING IN BETWEEN” (S: 17 A: 110)
<br /><br />Abd Allah Ibn Masoud Reciting the Quran Loud:
<br /><br />The first of Allah’s messenger’s companions to have recited the Quran out loud was Abd Allah Ibn Masoud.  He went out to the Kabba, and when he reached Maqam Ibrahim he started reciting Sorat Al-Rahman “THE MERCIFUL * HE TAUGHT THE QURAN, HE CREATED MAN * TAUGHT HIM TO SPEAK * …………….”  When they heard him, they went on beaten him up, and he continued to recite the Quran, until he could not any more, then he stopped.  He was then the only one to have recited the Quran out loud in public after Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />When The People of Makah Prostrated: 
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him sat by the Kabba one day and started to recite Sorah Al-Najm.  Every one around, believers or disbelievers sat and listened and they were taken by the Sorah. 
<br /><br />When Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him reached the end of the Sorah which had a prostration (Sajda), he prostrated and every one else believers and disbelievers prostrated.  Some of the Muslims thought that this was a sign that they all embraced Islam, but it was not, Even though even the disbelievers were so moved by this Sorah.

<br /><br />When the persecution of the Muslims in Makah became too much, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said to his companions: “You may go to the land of Habasha (Abyssinia) for there is a king who is not unjust to any one, may Allah makes there your relief from what you are going through”
<br /><br />A number of Allah’s messenger companions who were able to migrate, did migrate escaping with their Faith, of them:
<br /><br />-	Othman Ibn Afan and his wife Roqayah, the daughter of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.
<br />-	Abu Hozifa Ibn Otba Ibn Rabae and his wife Sahla bent Sohil Ibn Amro, who gave birth to a boy they called him Mohamed while in Abyssinia.
<br />-	Al-Zobir Ibn El-Awam
<br />-	Abd El-Rahman Ibn Awf.
<br />-	Abu Salama and his wife Om Salama.
<br />-	Othman Ibn Mazoon.
<br />-	Amer Ibn Rabae and his wife Lila.
<br />-	Abi Sabra Ibn Abi Dirham.
<br />-	Sohil Ibn Bidaa.
<br /><br />This was the first wave of migrants, who were followed by:
<br /><br />-	Jafar Ibn Abi Taleb and his wife Asmaa Bent Omis
<br />-	Amro Ibn Saeed Ibn El-Ase and his wife Fatema.
<br />-	Khalid Ibn Saed Ibn El-Ase and his wife Amena.
<br />-	And others.  The total number was 82 men with their wives and children.
<br /><br />The Muslims lived in Habasha (Abyssinia) securely under the protection of the king there titled Nagashi.  They practiced their religion safely, not being hurt or insulted by any one.  
<br /><br />The people of Qurish decided to send two of their most cunning men, Amro Ibn El-Ase and Abd Allah Ibn Abi Rabae to ask the Nagashi to send them back to Makah.  Abd Allah and Amro went to the Nagashi and took with them presents to him and his bishops, and plenty of leather which the Nagashi likes very much, and they took presents to the bishops first. 
<br /><br />They spoke to the Nagashi about the Muslims and described them as fools, who migrated to his land and yet did not embrace his religion, Christianity.  They asked the Nagashi to send them back to Makah with them, and the bishops supported this idea.
<br /><br />The Nagashi was very angry, and he refused to surrender to them the people who sought refuge with him and in his land, without listening to them first, so that he may pass a fair judgement.
<br /><br />When Allah’s messenger’s companions there heard of that they met and discussed the situation.  They decided to answer the questions from the Quran and Sunah only, and they choose Jafar Ibn Abi Taleb to be their speaking person.
<br /><br />The Nagashi asked them in the presence of his bishops: “What is this religion which caused you to leave your people’s religion for and in the mean time you did not embrace my religion or any other known religion?”  Jafar said: “O king, we were living in ignorance, worship idles, eat dead animals and do all sins, break up with family relations, and be bad to our neighbours, the strong unfair to the weak, until Allah sent us a messenger from us, we know his origin and decent and also his character, honesty and truthfulness.  He called us to worship Allah only and stop worshipping idles, and commanded us to be truthful, fulfilling our trust, being good to our blood relations and neighbours, and to stop all sins and killing and giving false testimony, and wrongly taking the orphan’s money, and speaking ill of women, and commanded us to worship Allah with not partners besides him, and to pray, give charity and to fast (and mentioned the Islamic principles) we believed in him, and we followed what he had for us from Allah, so we worshiped Allah Alone with no partners, and we forbad to ourselves what we were forbidden and allowed ourselves what we were allowed.  Then our people attacked us, tortured and persecuted us to force us to return to the worship of idles instead of Allah the Highest, and to permit ourselves the evil things.  When we were overpowered and made life very hard for us, we left our homes to you’re your country, and we choose you above others, and we hoped for your protection and not to suffer injustice in your land O King”.  The Nagashi said: “Do you have anything of what he brought you from Allah?”  Jafar said: “Yes”, and he recited to from the beginning of Sorah Mariam.  By Allah, the Nagashi wept until his beard became wet, and so did the bishops.  Then the Nagashi said: “Indeed, this and what Jesus brought come out of the same light.  You may go, by Allah I will never give you to them or hurt you”
<br /><br />Then Amro had another plot, he said to the Nagashi that they say that Jesus the son of Mary was a slave”.  The Nagashi called them again and asked them what they say about Jesus the son of Mary?  Jafar said: “We say about him what our prophet prayer and peace upon him and that he is Allah’s slave and messenger and his spirit and word he sent to Mariam the virgin the chaste”.
<br /><br />The Nagashi picked up a little stick from the earth and said: “Jesus is no more that what may say about this stick (meaning is no more than what he said”.  Then he told the Muslims that they may live safely in his land, and should any one insult them, he will make them suffer, he said it three times.
<br />The Nagashi gave Amro and Abd Allah their presents back and told his bishops to do the same.  He said: “Give them their presents back, I do not need it.  Allah did not accept bribery in my case when he gave me my kingdom back so that will accept bribe as far as he is concerned and he did not do what people say about me, so that I do what people say about him”
<br /><br />How the Nagashi became king:
<br /><br />Going back in time a little, the Nagashi’s father was a Nagashi (Meaning king) of Abyssinia, and he had one boy while his brother had 12 boys, they decided to kill the king, following which they feared the revenge of his son when he gets older, yet his uncle refused to kill his nephew and he sold his as a slave.
<br /><br />The slave merchant took him in a ship, but soon there was a storm with thunder and lightening, and his uncle was struck by lightening which killed him.  Out of his 12 children, they could not find one who was good enough to be king; therefore, they looked for the previous Nagashi’s son to make king.  They looked out for him and eventually found him with the slaves’ merchant, and they took him from the merchant without paying his price.  
<br /><br />Time went by and the slave’s merchant found him and went to claim his price of 600 silver coins.  The Nagashi gave his courtiers the choice or either paying the merchant 600 silver coins or he will have to go with him, so they paid the money and the Nagashi was eventually free.
<br /><br />While the Muslims were still living in Abyssinia, a man challenged the Nagashi’s right to the throne.  The Muslims were very worried in case this man became Nagashi (king) and he might not treat them well. The Nagashi marched with his army to meet the army of his challenger on the other side of the Nile.  Al-Zobir swam across the Nile to the other side to follow the battle and to let the Muslims know its outcome.  Victory was to the side of Nagashi, and Al-Zobir swam across to give the Muslims the good news.  The Muslims live in Abyssinia in safety until they returned to join the rest of the Muslims and this was after their migration to Medina.
<br /><br />The Nagashi becoming Muslim: 
<br /><br />The Nagashi of Abyssinia embraced Islam and believed in Mohamed prayer and peace upon him being a prophet and messenger of Allah.  People around him felt it, and they met and decided to go against him because of him leaving their faith, and also for believing that Jesus the son of Mary is Allah’s slave and messenger.  The Nagashi knew about this and that they plan to meet with him.
<br /><br />The Nagashi sent to the Muslims to let them know what is happening, and he prepared ships to take them away, as he felt that those going against him might hurt the Muslims if they win the day. He wrote on a patch “There is no God other than Allah and Mohamed is his slave and messenger, and Jesus the son of Mary is his slave and messenger and spirit from Him, he sent to Mary” and he put this patch inside his cloth.  When he met those going against him, and they said that Jesus is the son of God, he put is hand on the patch in his clothe, and said that Jesus in no more than that (meaning what is in the patch).  
<br /><br />The Nagashi died on the ninth year after migration to Medina, and Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him know about it at the time it happened.  He told the Muslims about the death of the Nagashi and he led the Salah Al-Janaza on him.
<br /><br />It is also reported that one of the Nagashi’s sons was taken and sold as a slave and his name was Abi Nizr, and a slave merchant in Makah had him.  When Ali Ibn Abi Taleb saw him and knew who he was, he bought him and let him go free because of what his father the Nagashi did for the Muslims.  After the Nagashi’s death, people had a dispute concerning who should follow him on the throne.  When they know of the presence of his son with the Muslims and he was in Medina then, they sent to him to come to be made a king.  He refused, and said: “I was not to seek the throne after having Allah’s bounty of Islam”.

<br /><br />Omar Ibn El-Khatab embraces Islam:
<br /><br />Omar went out one day carrying his sword and looking for Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to do him harm.  He learned that he was with a group of his companions in a house by the Safa, and of the people there was Hamza and Ali Ibn Abi Taleb.
<br /><br />Omar was a very harsh man with the Muslims, persecuting and hurting them, although on some occasions he did show softness and compassion to them.  Of these occasions was when a Muslim woman by the name of Om Abd Allah was preparing for migration to Abyssinia (the second wave) when Omar Ibn El-Khatab passed her by, and said: You are going off them Om Abd Allah?  She said: Yes.  We will go out into Allah’s land until Allah makes a way out for us, for you have hurt and oppressed us.  Omar said: May Allah be with you, and he said it softly. 
<br />This was the first time he showed softness to the Muslims.
<br /><br />On his way to where Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was, he met a man of his tribe Bani Adi, called Naem Ibn Abd Allah, who was a Muslim but kept his Islam secret fearing his people.  He asked Omar where he was going, and Omar told him that he was going to kill Mohamed.  Naem reminded Omar that Mohamed’s family would kill him if he does, and that he ought to see to his family first, informing him that Omar’s sister Fatima and her husband Saed Ibn Zyd who was also his cousin were Muslim. 
<br /><br />Omar then changed direction and headed for his sister’s house.  At the time they had Khabab Ibn Al-Aret teaching them the Quran, and they had a sheath with Sorah Taha or part of it written.  When they saw Omar coming, they hide Khabab in one of the rooms, and Fatema hide the sheath under her thigh.  However, Omar already heard them reading the Quran, and he asked about it, but they denied.  He told them that he heard that they embraced Islam, and went for Fatima’s husband hitting him.  When Fatima tried to save her husband from Omar’s hands, Omar Hit her and cut her head open.  
<br /><br />When Omar saw the blood on his sister’s head and face, he regretted what he did and calmed down.  He asked to have a look at the Quran Sheath, but his sister told him that as a disbeliever he is impure and he has to bath before touching the Quran.  Omar bathed and read from the beginning of Sorat Taha, which moved him and he said: “How good these words are and how noble”.   Khebab heard him from his hiding and came out to say to Omar that he heard the day before Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him say: “Allah, support Islam with one of the two, Abi Al-Hakam Ibn Hesham or Omar Ibn El-Khatab”.  Omar asked them to take him to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, and they took him to the house by Safa.
<br /><br />When Allah’s messenger’s companions saw Omar going to them carrying his sword, Hamza said: Let him come in, if he wants something good, we will do it for him and but if he tries an thing bad, we will kill him with his own sword.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him let Omar in, and then he took hold of his cloth and pulled him hard and said: “What is the matter with you Omar, will you not stop until something terrible happens to you?”
<br />Omar said: “Allah’s messenger, I came to believe in Allah and His messenger and what came from Allah”.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him glorified God saying Allah Akbar, from which every one in the house knew that Omar embraced Islam.
<br /><br />Omar asked as to the person who spreads the news fastest in Qurish?  He was told he was Jameel Ibn Moamar.  Omar went to him and told him about his Islam, and Immediately Jameel got up and went around shouting the news, and Omar walked behind him.  It was not long before Omar was attacked, and he went on fighting his attackers all day.
<br /><br />Omar embracing Islam was a step forwards for the Muslims, particularly after Hamza embraced Islam, Allah’s messenger’s uncle; for Hamza and Omar were two strong men, feared by their people, and they were a great support for the Muslims.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger ppuh write to Nagashi: 
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him sent a message to the Nagashi of Abyssinia concerning the Muslims in his land.  The message was carried by Amro Ibn Omiya and it said: “In the name of Allah the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.  From Mohamed Allah’s slave and messenger to the Nagashi Al-As-ham, the king of Abyssinia.  Peace upon you.  I thank and praise Allah, the King, the Holly, the Faithful, the Overseeing, and I give testimony that Jesus is Allah’s spirit and word sent to Mariam the virgin, the pure, the kind and the chaste, which caused her to conceive Jesus, who was created from His spirit, and blow into him as He created Adam with his hands and blow into him.  I ask you to come to Allah, one with no partners, and to obey him always, and to follow me and believe in me and what came to me, for I am Allah’s messenger.  I sent my cousin Jafar with a number of the Muslims to you.  When they come, let them live there and do not be arrogant and overpowering.  I call you and your soldiers to Allah, the most Exalted, the Majestic.  I delivered (the message) and advised you, so accept my advice, and peace is upon those who follow the right guidance”.
<br /><br />Nagashi’s Reply: 
<br /><br />The Nagashi wrote to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him saying: “In the name of Allah the Most Merciful the Compassionate.  To Mohamed Allah’s messenger from the Nagashi Al-AsHab Ibn El-Abgar; Peace upon you Allah’s prophet and Allah’s Mercy and Blessings.  There is no god other than Allah who guided me to Islam.  I received your letter Allah’s messenger and what you mentioned about Jesus, by the Lord of the heavens and earth Jesus is no more than what you said.  We recognized what you sent to us and let your cousin and his companions settle here.  I testify that you are Allah’s messenger, with the truth and to be believed.  I give you allegiance and give your cousin whom I embraced Islam before him, and to Allah the lord of all the worlds.  Allah’s messenger, I sent you Arbaha Ibn Al-AsHam, for I only have power over myself.  If you wish me to come to you Allah’s messenger, I will, for I testify that what you say is the truth”.
<br /><br />Sorat Al-Masad:  
<br /><br />One day, Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him went out until he reached the top of the Safa and shouted out for people.  When people gathered around him, he said: What do you think if I told you about horsemen coming from around this mountain, would you believe me?  They said: Yes, you did not lie to us before.  He said: Then I am warning you before severe punishment.  His uncle Abu Lahab said:  You may perish, is this is what you gathered us for?  Allah the Highest then sent down Sorat Al-Masad saying: “PERISH WILL THE HANDS OF ABI LAHAB AND PERISH WILL HE * HIS MONEY AND WHAT HE EARNED WILL NOT SAVE HIM * HE WILL BURN IN A FIRE WITH FLAMES * AND HIS WIFE WILL CARRY THE FIRE-WOOD * AROUND HER NECK IS A ROBE OF LOOFA”.  
<br /><br />Om Jameel, Abu Lahab’s wife thought that this was a sort of offensive poetry insulting her when she heard these Ayahs.  
<br /><br />Sorat Al-Kafroon: 
<br /><br />The disbelievers in Makah offered Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him that they worship Allah for a month or a year then he worships the idles for similar period etc.  Allah the Highest sent down this Sorah telling the believers and disbelievers that the believers do not worship idles for a year, month or a minute.  This was Sorat Al-Kafroon saying: SAY: YOU DISBELIEVERS * I DO NOT WORSHIP WHAT YOU WORSHIP * AND YOU DO NOT WORSHIP WHAT I WORSHIP * AND I AM NOT WORSHIPPING WHAT YOU WORSHIP * AND YOU ARE NOT WORSHIPPING WHAT I WORSHIP * YOU HAVE YOUR RELIGION AND I HAVE MINE”.
<br /><br />The Muslims in Abyssinia received false news about the Makans becoming all Muslims.  That news were because of the fact that one day Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him sate by the Kabba and started to recite the Quran, Sorat Al-Najm loudly, and people Muslims and disbelievers sate listening to him.  When he reached the end of the Sorah, which had a prostration, he prostrated, and so did every one else believers and disbelievers, except for an old disbeliever.
<br /><br />It is possible that someone carried this news prematurely to the Muslims in Abyssinia thinking that all of Makah embraced Islam.  This lead to some of the Muslims going back to Makah to find the situation to be still the same and the majority of the Makans are worshipping idles still.
<br /><br />Othman Ibn Mazoon; was one of the men to have returned to Makah.  He feared to enter Makah without any protection.  He sought the protection of Al-Waleed Ibn El-Mogera who gave him his protection.  Othman lived for few days under the protection of the Waleed, however he felt bad that the Muslims are suffering and tortured, which he enjoys safety being in the protection of a disbeliever.  He considered this weakness in his faith, therefore he publically gave up this protection.
<br /><br />Al-Waleed Ibn Al-Mogera: was the chief man in Makah.  He said how would the Quran be sent down to an ordinary man and not the chief or Makah or Taef, meaning that if Allah the Highest was to communicate with someone there, Allah should have communicated with a chief.  Allah the Highest sent down sent down the following Quran: “AND THEY SAID: IF THIS QURAN WAS SENT DOWN ON ONE OF THE GREAT MEN OF THE TWO VILLAGE * DO THEY SHARE YOUR LORD’S MERCY OUT, WE GAVE EACH HIS SHARE IN THE LOWER LIFE, AND RAISED SOME OF THEM DEGREES ABOVE THE OTHERS, AND SOME OF THEM TAKE THE OTHERS IN JEST, BUT THE MERCY OF YOUR LORD IS BETTER THAN ALL THEY MAY GATHER”. (S:43 A:31-32)
<br /><br />Oqbah Ibn Abi Maet sat with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him listening to the Quran.  A man of the disbelievers new and said to Oqbah, that he will never speak to him unless he spites in Allah’s messenger’s face.  Oqbah went and spate in Allah’s messenger’s face.  Allah the Highest sent Quran down about this in Sorat Forqan: “THE DAY WHEN THE UNJUST WILL BITE HIS HAND AND SAY: I WISH I WENT DOWN THE SAME PATH AS THE MESSENGER * I WISH I NEVER TOOK SO AND SO FOR INTIMATE FRIEND * HE MISGUIDED AWAY FROM THE ZEKR (QURAN) WHEN IT CAME TO ME, BUT THE DEVIL ALWAYS LETS MAN DOWN”.  (S:25 A:27-29)
<br /><br />Obi Ibn Khalaf went one day to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him with very old brittle bone and said: Mohamed, you claim that Allah will resurrect this after it became old and brittle?  Then he crushed the bone with his hand and blow it up at the face of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  Allah the Highest sent down Quran of Sorat Yaseen answering him: “HE GAVE US AN EXAMPLE, WHILE FORGETTING HIS OWN CREATION SAYING: WHO WILL RESURRECT THE BONE AFTER IT BECAME OLD AND BRITTLE * SAY: HE WHO CREATED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE WILL RESURRECT IT, FOR HE HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL CREATION * WHO MADE FIRE FOR YOU FROM THE GREEN TREES YOU USE FOR FUEL * IS HE WHO CREATED THE HEAVENS AND EARTH NOT ABLE TO CREATE OTHERS LIKE THEM? YES INDEED, FOR HE IS THE ALL KNOWING CREATOR * BUT WHENEVER HE WILLS SOMETHING TO BE HE SAYS: BE. AND IT WILL BE * THEREFORE GLORY IS TO HE WHO HAS IN HIS HAND ALL KINGDOMS, AND TO HIM YOU WILL RETURN”.  (S:36 A:78-83)
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was talking with Al-Waleed Ibn El-Mogerah telling his about Islam, hoping that he will embrace Islam, when Ibn Om Maktoom went to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him asking him to teach him some Quran.  Ibn Om Maktoom was a blind man.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him frowned and looked away no more, which the blind man did not see, but Allah the Highest did, and He sent to His messenger prayer and peace upon him Quran to tell him that he should not have done, and that the blind man was more worthy of his time: “HE FROWNED AND TURNED AWAY * WHEN THE BLIND MAN WENT TO HIM * AND HOW DO YOU KNOW HE MIGHT WISH TO PURIFY HIMSELF * OR REMEMBER SOMETHING AND IT WILL BENEFIT HIM * ……………” (S:80)
<br /><br />This gentle reminder from Allah the Highest to His messenger is also in the best form.  It is written in the best and most honoured book and carried by the chief angel.  Reciting its words is worshipping which Allah the Highest rewards us for each and every letter.  This shows us the High status which Allah the Highest held for His messenger prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />These were some of the situations which took place in Makah before the Migration of the Muslims to Medina, and which Allah the Highest sent Quran about.

<br /><br />The Boycott:
<br /><br />The disbelievers of Qurish agreed on a plan to pressurize Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and his family and clan who protect him, despite the fact the majority of the did not believe yet.  They agreed to send the descendants of Abu Taleb and Hashem from Makah, to any dry area outside Makah Called Sheb Abi Taleb.  They also agreed that they should not buy or sell any thing with them, and not to intermarry with them.  They wrote their agreement on a sheath they kept inside the Kabba.
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him lived with his clan in Sheb Abi Taleb for three years, in tents and in very harsh conditions, with little food and water, they had to eat tree leaves, and anything they find even deal animals.  Even under these conditions, Allah’s messenger family and clan did not give up protecting him and did not think of surrendering him those who wanted to kill him.
<br /><br />Hesham Ibn Amro was a man of high position and good esteem in Makah, and he was close to Bano Hashem.  He used to take food to them secretly by night, carrying it on the back of a camel.
<br /><br />Hesham went one day to Zohir Ibn Omyah and they discussed what is happening to Bano Abd El-Motaleb and Bano Hashem in their exile in Sheb Abi Taleb.  They agreed to do their best to break up this boycott; however they felt that they need a third man to support them.  They two of them went to Al-Motam Ibn Adi and they spoke to him about their wish, and he agreed with them.  The three of them went to see Al-Buhtori Ibn Hesham, and told him what they wanted to do, he agreed, and they became four.  The four of them went to Zoma Ibn Al-Aswad, and sought his support, he agreed and they became five.
<br /><br />The five of them agree to meet by night to plan what they were going to do, and they met and agreed to break up the boycott, and that Zohir will be the first man to talk in public about it.
<br /><br />Zohir went to the sacred mosque and spoke out saying: “O people of Makah, do we eat and wear cloths, while descendants of Hashem (Bano Hashem) are perishing, no one is buying or selling with them, by Allah I will not rest until I destroy this unjust, boycotting agreement”.  Abu Jahl went to oppose Zohir, but Zohir’s four companions stood up to defend his and his cause.
<br /><br />Ibn Is,Haq narrated that Allah’s messenger pray and peace upon him said to Abu Taleb his uncle: “My uncle, my Lord made the termites each Qurish’s agreement sheath and only left Allah’s name and erased all the injustice, boycotting and falsehood”  Abu Taleb said: “Did your Lord tell you that?” He said: “Yes”. 
<br /><br />Abu Taleb went out and said: “People of Qurish, my nephew tells me so and so, therefore stop boycotting us, and stop what you doing, and if he is lying, I will surrender my nephew to you”.  They said: “We agree” and they all agreed to that.  When they look at the sheath and found what Allah’s messenger said to be true, they became angrier, however, the sheath was torn and the agreement it had was broken.
<br /><br />During the year this agreement broke, Abu Taleb, Allah’s messenger’s uncle who brought him us and protected him, died.  This was a great personal loss and a big loss for all the Muslims.
<br /><br />During the same year Khadija bent Khowayled, Allah’s messenger’s wife died.  He lost the kind heart and the tender faithful wife and support for Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him.  This year because the year of grief for Allah’s messenger by losing his uncle and wife.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil Ibn Amro Al-Doci:
<br /><br />Al-Tofil was the chief of his tribe Doci and the noble man there.  He was also a thoughtful and wise man.  When he went to Makah, it’s people told him never to talk to or listen to Mohamed prayer and peace upon him, to the extend that he put cotton wool in his ears.  However, when he reached the Kabba Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was praying there, and Al-Tofil unintentionally heard some of the Quran, and he liked what he heart.  He thought to himself; why would he obey others without thinking about the matter himself.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil decided to go to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and ask him about Islam.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him talked to him about Islam, and recited the Quran to him, and Tofil decided to embrace Islam.  Al-Tofil said to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him that he is respected and obeyed by his people, and asked him if he can have a sign to help him to persuade his people, and Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him asked Allah to give him a sign.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil went back home to Doci, and when he got near, he found that he has light right in front of his face.     He asked Allah to move it elsewhere and it was moved to his whip, and every one in the tribe was this light in his whip as he came nearer.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil told his father about Islam and he embraced Islam, and also told his wife who embraced Islam too.  They he started to talk to one household after another and the people of Doci slowly but steadily became Muslim.  Mean while, the Muslims migrated to Medina, and the battle of Badr took place, and after the taking of Khyber, he migrated to Medina along with 70-80 household from Doci.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was overjoyed to see them, and he gave them a share of the bounty of the battle.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil lived in Medina with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him until the death of Allah’s messenger.  When some tribes refused to pay Zakah or left Islam, Abu Bakr sent armies to fight them, and Al-Tofil went with these armies, and he went to the battle of Yamamah.  Before the battle he saw a vision that he shaved his head, and a bird flew out of his mouth, then he me a women and his body entered her body through her genitalia, and saw his son eagerly going after him, but he was kept away from him.  When he told the people about his vision, they said: Good Allah willing.  He said: Bu I understand it, as for the shaving of the head it means that his head will be put down, and the bird flying out of my mouth is my soul, and the woman is the earth will be split open for me to be buried, as for my son eagerly going after him is that his son will be hurt in the battle.
<br /><br />Al-Tofil was martyred during the battle of Yamamah, and his son had a bad wound but was not killed.  He died years later during the battle of Yarmok, during the rule of Omar Ibn El-Khatab.  May Allah be pleased with and has mercy upon Al-Tofil and his son.
<br /><br />The Mood Splitting Asunder:
<br /><br />Bukhari, Muslims and Ahmed narrated that the disbelievers asked Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him to show them sign of his prophecy on a night when the moon was complete, and the moon spit asunder into two halves.  They said: This is magic.  Allah the Highest send down these Ayahs of Sorat Al-Qamar (the moon): “THE HOUR DRAW NEAR AND THE MOON SPLIT ASUNDER * AND WHEN THEY A SIGN THEY TURN AWAY AND SAY: ONGOING MAGIC * THEY DENIED AND FOLLOWED THEIR DESIRES BUT EVERY THING WILL SETTLE”. (S: 54 A: 1-3)
<br />The disbelievers did believe after seeing this great miracle, which shows that they used to ask Allah’s messenger for miracles, hoping to find evidence to deny his prophecy not as a proof of his prophecy.
<br /><br />Wrestling with Rekana: 
<br />Ibn Is, Haq narrated that Rekana Ibn Abd Yazed Ibn Hashem was the strongest man in Qurish and Makah, and he would defeat any one he wrestles.  He met Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, and they were on their own outside Makah. Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “Rekana, would you not protect yourself from Allah’s displeasure and follow me?”  Rekana said: “If I know that what you say is true, I would have followed you”.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: How if I overcome you wrestling”.  Rekana got up to fight him by Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him overcame him easily.  Rekana asked to try again and he was defeated again and a third time.  Rekana said: “This is really amazing Mohamed, how could you defeat me?”
<br />He said to him: “And I can show you more, if you fear Allah and follow me”.  Rekana said: “what is that?”  He said: “I will call this tree and it will come to me”  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him called the tree and it came to him, then said to her to return and it returned back to it’s place.
<br />Rekana went to his people, and said: “O Bani Abd Manaf, you can use your man (Mohamed) to spell magic on all people on earth, for I have never seen a better magician, and he told them what happened wit Mohamed prayer and peace upon him.
<br /><br />The Christians visit: 
<br />A twenty men delegation of the Christians of Arabia went to see Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him in Makah.  This was a different delegation from the one which went from Najran to meet him in Medina.
<br />They sat down, listened to him and to the Quran, and were tearful when they heard the Quran.  Abu Jahl met them and was nasty and unpleasant to them. Allah the Highest sent down Quran about them saying: “THOSE WE HAVE GIVEN THE BOOK BEFORE YOU, THEY BELIEVE IN IT * AND WHEN IT IS RECITED TO THEM THEY SAY: WE BELIEVE IN IT, IT IS THE TRUTH FROM OUR LORD, AND WE HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS BEFOREHAND * THEY ARE TO BE GIVEN THEIR REWARD TWICE BECAUSE OF THEIR PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE, AND WARD OFF THE BAD DEED WITH A GOOD DEED, AND THEY SPEND OUT OF WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED * WHEN THEY HEAR THE BAD TALK, THEY TURN AWAY FROM IT, AND THEY SAY WE HAVE OUR DEEDS, AND YOU HAVE YOUR DEED, PEACE UPON YOU, WE DO NOT SEEK  THE IGNORANT”  (S:28 A:52-55) 
<br /><br />The Weak and Poor Muslims sitting with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him:
<br />When Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him sat in the sacred mosque, the weak and poor of the Muslims; like Khabab Ibn Al-Aret and Amar Ibn Yasser, used to sit with him.  The wealthy and noble of the Makans used to laugh at them and say that had what was sent to Mohamed been right, the wealthy and strong would have followed Mohamed and not the weak and poor.  Allah the Highest sent down Quran about this saying: “AND DO NOT TURN AWAY THOSE WHO CALL UPON THEIR LORD BY DAY AND NIGHT SEEKING HIM, YOU DO NOT JUDGE THEM AND THEY DO NOT JUDGE YOU, IF YOU TURN THEM AWAY YOU WILL BE OF THE UNJUST * SUCH WE TEMPTED SOME OF YOU BY THE OTHER FOR THEM TO SAY: DID ALLAH HAS HIS BOUNTY UPON THOSE FROM AMONGST US?  DOES ALLAH NOT KNOW BETTER WHO ARE THE THANKFUL”.  (S: 6 A: 52-53)
<br /><br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him sits with the Christian young man:
<br />A young Christian man who was not an Arab used to sit with Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him by the Marwa.  Some of the disbelievers said that he taught Mohamed prayer and peace upon him the Quran.  Allah the Highest sent down Quran answering them: “AND WE KNOW THAT THEY SAY THAT A HUMAN TEACHES HIM (THE QURAN), THE TONGUE OF THE ONE THEY REFER TO IS NOT ARAB, AND THIS IS A CLEAR ARABIC TONGUE”  (S:16 A:103)
<br /><br />Sorat Al-Kowther: 
<br />A man of the disbelievers called Al-Ase Ibn Wael used to say whenever Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him: Leave him for he is a man without offspring (had no living boy), once he dies, he will not be remembered, and you will have no trouble with him.  Allah the Highest sent down: “WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THE KOWTHER * SO PRAY FOR YOUR LORD AND SACRIFICE (OR SLAUGHTER) * HE WHO HATES YOU IS THE ONE WITHOUT OFFSPRING”. 
<br />Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was asked: “Allah’s messenger, what is the Kowther?”  He said: “It is a river in Paradise, as long as between Ayala and Sanaa.  It has cups and many as the stars in the heavens, and birds with necks like the camel’s neck go to it”.  In another narration: “Those who drink from it will never get thirsty”.
<br />The Disbelievers wanted to see the angels:
<br />Some of the disbelievers said to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him that they will believe him if they see him accompanied by an angel.  To be seen by people and talks to them, then this will be a proof of his prophecy.  Allah the Highest sent the following Ayahs down.  “AND THEY SAID: SHOULD AN ANGEL BE SENT DOWN TO HIM, AND IF WE SEND AN ANGEL DOWN, ALL WILL BE FINISHED, AND THEY WILL NOT BE GIVEN ANY REPRIEVE * AND IF WE MADE HIM AN ANGEL, WE WOULD MAKE HIM A MAN, AND THEY WILL STILL BE CONFUSED” (S: 6 A: 8-9)

<br /><br />Al-Israe and Mearage
<br /><br />Before going into the details of the Israe and Mirage, I would like to discuss two controversial points:
<br /><br />First; Did the Israe and M Mirage happen with body and soul or only by the soul?
<br />I would say that has the Israe and Mirage been done with the soul only, the material things that happened, would not have happened, particularly the drinking of the water some people left.  As far as denying that it could not have happened with the body as Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was not missed, and the where he slept was warm all the time, despite traveling very long distances on Earth then going up in the Heavens.  Weather these took days, hours or minutes, this would not matter to Allah the Highest and is not too much for him.  The one who did the Israe and Mirage was Allah the Highest who said: “PRAISE BE TO HIM WHO TOOK HIS SLAVE ON ISRAE FROM THE SACRED MOSQUE TO AL-AQSA MOSQUE” (S: 17 A: 1)
<br />It happened by Allah’s Power which is without a limit, not by his messenger’s power.
<br /><br />Second: Did Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him see Allah the Highest or not?
<br />Allah’s messenger said that he saw light and Allah shields him self from others with light, and he did not describe any thing more.  If Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him saw Allah the Highest and did not tell us, this would be a secret between him and his Lord, we should not discuss.
<br /><br />Om Hanai Hadith concerning Israe and Mirage:
<br /><br />Om Hanai real name was Hend and she was a cousin of Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him, daughter of his uncle Abu Taleb and a sister to Ali Ibn Abi Taleb.  She said: 
<br />“Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon went on Israe from my house.  He slept that night in my house after praying Esha, then went to sleep.  At Fajr, he rose and prayed the morning Salah and we prayed with him, then he said: “Om Hanai, I prayed the last Salah of Esha as you sae in this valley, then I went to Jerusalem and prayed them, then I prayed the Morning with you as you see”.  Then he rose to go out, I held the end of his garment and said: “Allah’s prophet, do not tell this to people, for they will not believe you and will hurt you.  He said: “By Allah, I will tell them”  She told an Abyssinian slave of hers: “Follow Allah’s messenger and listen to what people say”.
<br /><br />When he went out and told people, they said to him that they never heard any thing like it, and said to him what is the evidence for that?  He said: “The evidence is that I passed by the caravan of Bani so and so and one of their camels went astray and (he described the camel) then in another valley, he went by the caravan of Bani so and so who had water in container and the container was covered, he drank the water and recovered the container”
<br /><br />When they enquired from these caravans when they arrived to Makah, they found that what he told them was true.
<br /><br />On that night, Gabriel peace upon him wake him us and brought his an animal call “Al-Boraq” its size is between the mule and the donkey, and it had two wings, which Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him rode.  It toke him very fast to Jerusalem, and seeing things on the way, until her arrived to Jerusalem where he met, Ibrahim peace upon him  and Jesus peace upon him, with a group of the prophets gathered for him, and he lead them in Salah.
<br /><br />Then Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him was brought three containers, one containing wine, the second water and the third milk, he took the milk and drank it.  Gabriel peace upon him said: “You have been rightly guided and so has your nation and you will be forbidden intoxicants”
<br /><br />After finishing with Jerusalem, the Mirage was brought to him, and did not see any thing better.  It is what the dying person look up to when dying.  My companion (Gabriel) took me ascending it, until we reached one of the heavens gates, guarded by an Angel called Ismail, in charge of twelve thousand angels, each of them in charge of twelve thousand angels.  
<br /><br />Then Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “the Angels received me in the lower heaven, and whenever one receives me he will be happy and smiling and pleased and says good things and says Dawa for me, until one of the angels met men who said like what they said and said Dawa for my like the others, but he was not smiling and did not look pleased, I said to Gabriel: ‘O Gabriel, who is this angel who spoke to me like the other Angels but did not smile to me and was not pleased as the others?  He said: If he was to smile to any one before you or any one after you, he would have smiled to you, he is Malek, the keeper of the Fire’.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: ‘I said to Gabriel who has such status with Allah the Highest: “Would you order him to show me the Fire” He said: Yes.  Malek, show Mohamed the Fire.  He to a lid of it, it rose over until I thought she will burn ever thing I see.  I said to Gabriel: tell him to put it back where it was, and he told him, and it went down, and he covered it”
<br /><br />Then he said: “In the lower heaven, I saw a man and the soul of the human beings are shown to him.  When he sees some, he speaks well of and says: “A good soul, came out of a good body”, and to others he would say: off and would frown, and say: “an evil soul which came out of an evil body” He then said: “Who is that Gabriel?  He said: This is your father Adam, the souls of his offspring is shown to him, when a believer’s soul passes, he is pleased and says: A good soul out of a good body.  And when a disbeliever’s soul passes, he dislikes it and says: An evil soul out of an evil spirit”
<br /><br />Then he said: “Then I saw men with lips like the lips of the camel, and in their hands there are pieces of fire, they put into their mouths, and it comes out of their rears.  I asked: “Who are they Gabriel? He said: “They are those who unjustly devour the money of the orphans”.
<br /><br />And said: “Then I saw men who have good meat, and besides it bad, smelly meat.  They eat out of the bad and smelly meat and leave the good meat, I said: “Who are they Gabriel?  He said: “They are those who leave what Allah permitted them of the women, and go for what Allah the Highest has forbidden.
<br /><br />Then said: “Then I was women hanged by their breasts, I said: “Who are they Gabriel” They are the women who let children other than their husband, come to their husband’s home (through Adultery)&quot;
<br /><br />Then he took me up to the second heaven, and there I found the two cousins through their mothers, Jesus the son of Mary and Yehia the son of Zakaria. 
<br /><br />Then I was taken to the third heaven, I saw a man as good looking as then the moon when it is full.  I said: “Who is he Gabriel” He said: “This is Yusuf (Joseph) the son of Jacob”
<br /><br />Then I was taken to the fourth heaven, and there I saw a man, I said: “Who is this Gabriel?  He said: This is Idris.  Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him said: “AND WE RAISED HIM TO A HIGH STATE”
<br /><br />Then I was taken to the fifth Heaven, and there I found an aged man with while white hair and beard, I said: “Who is this Gabriel”, he said: “This is the one loved by his people, Haroon the son of Emran”.
<br /><br />Then I was taken to the sixth Heaven, and there I found a tall dark man with a curved nose, I asked: who is this Gabriel? He said: This is your brother, Moses the son of Emran.
<br /><br />Then I was taken to she seventh heaven, and their I found an aged man sitting on a chair by Al-Bayt El-Mamour, into which goes seventy thousand angel and do not return, up to the day of Resurrection, no one looks like your companion (himself) or I am more like any one more than him.  I asked: Who is he Gabriel?  He said: This is you father Ibrahim.  
<br /><br />Then He took me into the Paradise, and there I saw a dark maiden, I asked her, and she was good looking, whom does she belong to?   She said: “Zyd Ibn Haretha” And he told Zyd about this news.
<br /><br />Then Allah’s messenger prayer and peace went to audience with his Lord, where Gabriel could not enter with.  In the presence of Allah the Highest, he was given the command about the Salah.  It was given in direct communication with Allah the Highest, without any intermediaries.  It was for fifty Salah every day and night i.e. every 24 hours. On his way back he passed by Moses peace upon him who advised his to go back to Allah and ask for this heavy duty to be lightened, which he did down to forty Salah. Mohamed prayer and peace upon him kept going back until Allah the Highest made it 5 Salahs, rewarded as for fifty Salahs’  When Moses Advised him to go back, Mohamed prayer and peace upon him said that he was very shy of doing this again.  This is how the Salah was prescribed for us.  It was made a duty upon us when Allah the Highest honoured his messenger prayer and peace upon him, by the journeys of Israe and Mirage and by giving him an audience the Allah the Highest directly, in a place, no one else could enter.
<br /><br />Gabriel went to Allah’s messenger prayer and peace upon him and led him in Prayer the five times per day in two consecutive days, to teach him the way of praying.  In the First day, they prayed at the beginning of the time and next day at the end of the time for praying, and told him to pray between those times.  This is how we learned about the way of Salah and the time of the Salah.

<br /><br />It was once said that “If you can not keep your secret to yourself, do not expect others to keep it for you”.
<br />Wise words for those seeking wisdom, for Man’s secrets are those things he/she does not like others to know, for whatever reason.  However, being a social animal, who likes to be with people and communicating with them, he might feel the need to share his secrete with someone considered trustworthy.  When we share a secrete of ours with someone, there is always the assertion that no one else should know this secret, for not one else have been told about it.
<br />It is also reasonable to assume that this secrete will be less important to that person than to the initial keeper of the secret, and Therefore, he is more likely to let this secret known to others than the person who’s secret it is, who was in fact the first person to release this secret.  
<br />Consequently, unless a person has to share a particular secret with others, he should share it only with the least number of people he has to share it with.  By telling others who did not need to know, is in reality a divulgence of the secret, and one should not be surprised or angry if others do what he did of divulging his secret.
