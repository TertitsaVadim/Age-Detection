That reflection is the soul, which Jesus sanctioned by saying, &quot;I and the Father are one.&quot; Similar to Christ we should put aside every thought except a longing for truth. Thoughts being causes, we must realize that when we control our thoughts, we control their effects, and the conditions they cause. It then follows that our health, happiness and abundance are under our control and the way to change our conditions on earth is to change our thoughts. This realization of our power to control our destiny is the truth that sets us free. With this power to think we can guide our thoughts into spiritual activities instead of just dealing with the effects. We can use visualization, concentration, imagination and realization to direct our thoughts to our soul. This brings us close to God's all-pervading consciousness in everything.

This usually happens when we as individuals have no intent on having this effect on others because the force of magnetism works in an isolated way to unite separate human beings who belong together. An example of this attraction is the positive method that Jesus used to heal and inspirer faith in his followers. His teaching in the manner of parables is very wise, not forceful because they cultivate wisdom. To some these allegories are the most appealing part of the Bible because in the computer age information can be purchased, but wisdom can’t be exchanged for wealth. These heart-felt stories about the integrity of life generate no debate or conscious effort to change the audience into a specific mold because the meaning doesn’t come all at once, but only after struggle and effort. Those who are ready to understand the deeper meaning of the parable will see the universal truth, while others will see something else depending on what layer of the mind they are functioning in.         <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoaW5rdW5pdHkuY29t" target="_blank">Christian Mysticism</a>

It is not the dull habit of preaching, patronizing, condemning and judging others as insufficient. It is not the religion about Christ, but the religion of Christ. Descritions about Jesus are not what Christ described. He talked about the joys and realizations of heaven above the pain of earth.

These saints are free because they are unattached and have never hardened their minds to the physical world. They do respond though without delay to the trembling nerves they might encounter and to all the problems and questions, spoken and unspoken. Their desire is to remove the causes of sorrow whether they are physical, mental or spiritual because they prevent the unfortunate people in this world from happiness. Compared with true bliss nothing is of any importance because fame, health and success are nothing compared to the happiness experienced in the higher layers of the mind. The happiness evoked in the Discriminate Mind is not the same thing as excitement or pleasure experienced in the lower layers, it is a deep flowing calm, a satisfaction that mounts up at times into ecstasy and is to be shared with others.

We can hire others to work for us, to take care of our physical needs, but there are some things we must do ourselves. We must set ourselves right, put ourselves in harmony with life. This change of consciousness does not come by wishing, but by going through the layers of the mind and realizing that pure consciousness binds everything together in one complete aggregate within us. This spiritual experience and first-hand knowledge of what is true and real is the way to find peace and comfort. All great religions say we need peace of mind, but it means nothing unless we experience peace of mind. What peace does for the mind must be done through the mind so centering prayer, contemplative prayer, meditation, and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoaW5rdW5pdHkuY29t" target="_blank">Christian Mysticism</a>  help us  go through the layers of the mind where one achieves harmony. Peace of mind is in our unit consciousness springing from within, coming from the God consciousness that quenches every hunger. It works its way through the layers of the mind putting us back on track with reality because it is the key for man to unite with God, the visible with the invisible, and the Son with the Father. God Bless.  
<br /><br />St. Paul           1 Corinthians 2: 6-14
<br />Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are three words, but they are also one Word. This is similar to three musical notes vibrating together to make one sound or chord. There is only one God even though there are three aspects and many objects. God is all there is! The cosmic symphony is the universe vibrating a message of one body, one organic whole that separates and again unites in consciousness. The all-pervading consciousness, the true self of the universe redeems itself from dispersion in time and space because it unites all the diverse tendencies in one body of love. This makes it seem like the universe is one thing playing at being many.

		<document id="974e38da0ea2b97c5b1e45f7c58a5526" url=""><![CDATA[Christian Mysticism and One God<br/><br/>The Christian’s consciousness of acceptance that there is one God and that He created all things is a conceptual truth that frees the mind to think of God all the time. This relaxes the emotions so we can praise everything as good because it came from God. This kind of encounter Jesus revealed to be the key to reality, a connection to God or pure consciousness that has the ability to bring into physical being that which is spiritual and ultimately real. Jesus’ words were not meant to be an end in themselves, but a vehicle to lead a person to encounter the all-pervading God that is beyond the grasp of the mind and all words. Jesus had the ultimate experience with God consciousness and his consciousness was interchangeable with God’s. He is beyond the normal mundane world of time and space and is the living expression of pure consciousness where everyone can find fulfillment. Jesus said, “I and the Father are one.” This is where the formless becomes visible and the pure consciousness of God becomes expressed in the unit consciousness of an individual in the form of Christ consciousness.

<br />All things are born from it,
<br />yet it doesn't create them.
<br /><br />I feel Genesis is an example of this Tao principle, which is the emergence of being from non-being. I know it says that in the beginning God created heaven and earth, but if you bear with me I will give a different interpretation.  Genesis 2 “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”  I feel this great primordial ocean is a great ocean of pure consciousness. The ocean represents everything as an expression of oneness in the pictorial language of nature. Imagine all living things of the universe emerging out of an ocean of pure consciousness, being maintained in this ocean and finally dissolving into it in the end. I feel this abstract image is God the Father. He does not act, but lets the Holy Ghost act on this great body, the Father. Genesis  3 “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. The Trinity, which I am eluding, is only to show the duality in unity. Imagine this ocean of pure consciousness with some parts frozen. The liquid part represents pure consciousness, which is not manifested materially and the icebergs represent pure consciousness as it is manifested in the universe thus we have creation. The ocean and the icebergs are both made of water so they both contain pure consciousness. We are able to live because this pure consciousness lives within us, we are able to move because a universal energy flows through us, and we are also able to think because there is an infinite consciousness thinking through us. This water or pure consciousness is an infinite ocean, but in it is the finite water or ice; thus, we have the word infinite, (in-the-finite).
<br /><br />In the medium of the ocean of pure consciousness, the Holy Trinity is in equilibrium. The Trinity is a Christian term used to express the three basic forces in nature. This Holy Trinity contains the force that freezes the water so that it may manifest itself in the form of icebergs so pure consciousness may materialize. The Holy Trinity is; the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost and is the Christian symbol for God from which the universe emanates, has its growth, realizes pure consciousness and merges in the end. When the Holy Trinity is in equilibrium it transcends the limitations of time; past, present and future; the genders; masculine, feminine and neuter; and the mind; conscious, subconscious and unconscious. When the equilibrium is disturbed, each principle of the Holy Trinity has the opportunity to express itself. This is the emergence of being from non-being or what we refer to as creation. The primordial waters are a theoretical expression showing the creative spirit of God bringing order out of what seems to be chaos. In creation there is still oneness, but the awareness of this oneness in all things becomes lost in the individual awareness of the parts.
<br /><br />It pours itself into its work,
<br />yet it makes no claim.
<br />It nourishes infinite worlds,
<br />yet it doesn't hold on to them.
<br />Since it is merged with all things
<br />and hidden in their hearts,
<br />it can be called humble.
<br /><br />God, the Father is used in the pervasive sense that is the pure consciousness that is all pervading and as Christians, we say God is all knowing because he is all pervading. The Witnessing Consciousness, God the Father is everywhere, He lies quiescent in every entity; therefore, He is all seeing and all pervading. In our model God the Father is the ocean of pure consciousness and in this ocean of pure consciousness, God the Father allows the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, as you may call it, to operate. God the Father is the primary cause of creation; the Holy Ghost is the secondary cause. This is because the Father allows the Holy Spirit to give qualities to the all-pervading consciousness. The Holy Spirit is not all pervading so only the Father can be the material cause. The Holy Ghost is the operative principle or the force that freezes the water. It is allowed to operate and is sheltered in the Father so the Holy Ghost can only work as much as the Father allows it to. In the science of creation only the Father is the instrumental cause. He said, &quot;Let there be light and there was light.&quot;
<br /><br />Since all things vanish into it
<br />and it alone endures,
<br />it can be called great.
<br />It isn't aware of its greatness;
<br />thus it is truly great.
<br /><br />The Holy Trinity represents God from which nature comes, maintains it's growth, and into which it dies and merges in the end; thus, this triangle is the strongest form in nature. The Father is all encompassing and is both in the world and beyond it so everything is within His Body and nothing is outside of Him. As all ice comes from water (pure consciousness) so also all forms of this creation come from the Father or pure consciousness. 
<br />The Holy Ghost is also within the body of the Father and can act only as far as the Father permits. It is the energy or force that causes the activity and change within the body of the Father. The Holy Ghost does not affect the Father because it is within the Father’s body so He is still unchanged. The Father only allows the activity to happen and does no activity Himself because He is completely at peace. He only permits the Holy Ghost to act or not. 
<br />The Holy Ghost has the power to super-impose a force over some of the pure consciousness, but it doesn't have the power to change it. This force is what hides from the individual consciousness that which connects it to the Whole or the Father. This super-imposition of the particular over the universal is the birth of the individual soul. The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost are a triad. If you take a cup of water from the ocean, the water in the cup is the same as the water in the ocean. There is no difference. The ocean is the Father, the Holy Ghost creates the cup and the water in the cup is the Son. 
<br /><br />In a composition we can say that the Father is the subject matter, the Holy Ghost is the action and the Son is the intent. The masterpiece is the unity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. This is the Holy Trinity, and upon deep inquiry, we see The Holy Trinity trying to make sense of non-duality. This is a logical problem because the mind in time and space only knows duality, but when we say God is everything, we are saying God is one. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoaW5rdW5pdHkuY29t" target="_blank">all-pervading consciousness</a>  is everywhere and is without duality, but it is not without relations.

Women and people excluded, our brothers and sisters have special and pastoral gifts so there is a need to challenge the church to incorporate these gifts in every sphere of the church. I am not saying men and women are identical, women and men, men and men and women and women tend to be different. This diversity is desperately needed in the leadership of the body of Christ.  
<br />I feel patriarchy is the problem and the theological result of the biblical fall because it leads to degradation and violence against people worldwide. It seems the church is a fallen system and will continue to be as long as patriarchy is a legitimate component of biblical Christianity. It is appalling and unchristian for us to perpetuate the fallen powers on which patriarchy's system is structured. We need to discern with the spirit the deception being disseminated upon our Christian brothers and sisters. Christian need to be awakened as many have already posted to the disgrace being propagated. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoaW5rdW5pdHkuY29t" target="_blank">Christian mysticism</a>

It focuses my mind into a laser promoting and facilitating the nervous and circulatory systems to invigorate my body and mind. It is one way my soul can conserve and channel energy that is lost in drifting habits. This is a kind of healing, an adaptation, absorption and practice of spiritual knowledge to align my mind with my soul. Currents that produce anger, divisive thoughts and destructive actions become apparent, and the energy currents that produce love, healing thoughts and constructive actions bring my attention to the field of the soul where understanding the impersonal nature of energy and the interconnected dynamics of everything beyond the senses is beneficial to my life.  In this state of being I learn to love without restriction and accept without judgment because I am not on the level of thinking, which is my well-versed, experienced, relative existence. Identifying with the consciousness of the soul I slowly learn about the energy of life, the value of creativity, healing and love. Releasing negativity, disharmony and violence Christian contemplation and meditation shows me the way to serve the power of my soul by increasing my knowledge of the finer strata of existence so I can align with it.  It is a journey through the layers of my mind leading to the perception of Christ consciousness.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fthinkunity.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://thinkunity.com</a>

Following a spiritual path is difficult because of Trust and Faith. We may have faith in God and that all things are united, but not trust that people are ready to hear it or the world is ready for it with all the strife. We may believe God is talking to us in different ways, but then question these intuitions as weird spirit voices. I feel we may trust we are on the right path, but not believe it, if we think others are on the wrong path. I feel to do great spiritual work we need to believe and trust in what we are doing. This is reflected in that we also feel others are doing exactly what they are suppose to be doing at this time. 
<br /><br />To connect Trust and Faith, I feel we have to reconnect with our faith so we need to take time to pray, meditate, listen to music, read, write, daydream, build sandcastles or whatever to connect to the Spirit within. Our deep spiritual faith will reconnect with Trust. If we lack faith then we need to argue, sing, talk, and listen to our God, which is the same God as others so there is no need to argue with other people. If we don’t have faith then our work is not spiritual. We need people to give their spiritual gifts and people need to share their spirit so we need to encourage all faiths to express their love and devotion. I feel this will get rid of religious terrorism, suicide bombers and condemning of others.

<br />I feel in the heart of everyone, God comes, and God goes in the form of pure consciousness. It is not that the pure consciousness is not there, but the awareness is not there. When the heart and the mind become vast, deep and limitless, then Christ makes a heaven in that graceful heart, and pure consciousness and bliss prevails. The experience is recognized as love and peace. Christians and non-Christians have this experience. In the absence of this experience especially among my fellow Christians arrogance, separation and even hatred arises, divisions of every sort fragment the mind and heart. I feel it is the responsibility of our Christian leaders to educate others of this experience, but first they must find it in themselves. Many times it is the ones without the experience of silence that preach the loudest without knowing the inner meaning of the words.

Because of their manifestations we can conclude that their reality exists, but we cannot give a reason why Truth is true. At the same time the scientist can't give a good explanation for the action of the atom. A physicist may study the atom and learn something about its nature and how it operates, but he can't give a reason for its action, only a theory. One does not make universal laws and principles; one only discovers and makes use of them. One must accept this position in relation to consciousness, rather than contradict it, in order to experience it.
<br /><br />No one has ever encompassed the depths of pure consciousness because it reaches out to Infinity, and no one can encompass Infinity. One only enlarges one's capacity to know and to experience it. In our present state of awareness we are standing with our eyes next to the painting and only see one small patch of colors at a time, but in our pure consciousness we see the whole picture. The whole picture or pure consciousness can't be divided.

God impels seeking through love, not fear that is why he sent us his son and Christ Consciousness. When one becomes aware of Christ Consciousness, one falls in love with everything, everyone and God Himself. God is not separate from anything; He is the Life of our life, the Reality within our own reality and the Soul within our being. Christ consciousness leads us to the pure consciousness of Our Father. Jesus had a pure mind so his actions were pure and with the replication between Christ Consciousness and our own consciousness we can become better at living a pure life. This is the bringing of our own minds and wills into agreement with Christ Consciousness, a consciousness where we experience God and get submerged in the loving will of God. It starts us on a journey toward a new consciousness where Christ Consciousness purifies the mind so it becomes free, not worried, and unattached. Christ Consciousness shows us the way to pure consciousness because it doesn’t want its own way, but the Lord’s way. Christ said, “Lord let Thy Will be done.&quot;

The Holy Man replied you are across the river. We are already there, but we are not aware of it. The technique doesn't matter, what matters is the awareness. If I wake up with an alarm clock or the light it doesn't matter once I am awake.

I like the combination of science and religion so as we evolve spiritually we see religion as an opened ended truth that is constant, but changes with our realization. We need a spiritual science that will reveal or explain our insights into key principles of our consciousness and allow us to have an individual experience related to the challenges we face in life. May it help us understand what we are experiencing in the moment transforming our life to one aligned with the Divinity within.

<br />The Spirit is always there so we must transform and enlarge our personal consciousness and individual experience with the Holy Spirit. This is basic to every mode of spiritual discernment, and every quest. The more we are aware of Spirit working in and through everything, especially within ourselves, the more God’s presence can replace prior limitations and disharmonies with good. Our minds will act on the new ideas that are formed and form a new, more positive belief and attitude. This deep understanding sees the good of God everywhere and always present. This shift in attitude brings greater freedom; peace and joy so we need to give up the old worries, free ourselves and replace old ideas with the knowledge that everything we need is available. When we recognize Spirit and pull into life revelation, discernment and right choices are made.
<br />Isn't amazing how throughout the ages mystics of all stripes and religions have plugged into almost universal concepts of love, unity and oneness, compassion and justice for all, regardless of their culture or religion.
