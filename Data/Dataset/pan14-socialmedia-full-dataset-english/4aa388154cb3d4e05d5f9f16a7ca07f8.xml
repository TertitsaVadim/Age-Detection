<br /><br />Some people may believe that if you love something you let it go.... and if it comes back it was meant to be... if it doesnt then it was never really love at all....
<br /><br />i think thats a load of horse shit.... 
<br /><br />If you love something dont let it go... hold on for dear life and work your arse off to get by... if that fails... then the only adivce that you will ever need.... is that if you love someone, you have to do whatever you can in your power to make them have a happier life... with you.... or without you
<br /><br />i think i may have rambled enough now, but it helped... 
<br /><br />to all of you out there that have been hurt by hanging on... dont remember the pain that was caused... remember the happiness you had.... because a second of happiness forgotten is one you will never get back..
<br /><br />hold on to those seconds and eventually you will get your happily ever after.

<br />you didnt seem to mind...
<br />i'd take it back in a second if i knew that things would be ok...
<br />i never wanted to let go so i'm never going to...
<br />all it takes is a call... a message... a letter in the mail...
<br /><br />i dunno... in my mind the only thing that matters your happiness
<br /><br />i...
<br /><br />just dont know

<br /><br />*bangs head on desk*
<br /><br />now that this is out of the way...
<br /><br />I'm confused as hell...
<br /><br />Trying to work through everything in my head...
<br /><br />I have a big choice to make in about a month....
<br /><br />Whether to Pack up and move away from everything I have grown to Love and to Hate, the place that I have made my life, and just move and start fresh... with the chance that when i get back... none of it will be here...
<br /><br />Or whether to stay in hopes that one day soon I will have back everything I loved, family, friends, love itself.... i've never been one for change.... in fact i made a huge change not long ago and i hated doing it... and i hate the after effect.... but for some reason i felt it had to be done
<br /><br />I hate making decisions... especially ones that I know I might regret....
<br /><br />If only I had something to help me make decisions.... some sort of sign saying.... go there.... or please dont leave...
<br /><br />Its all too much sometimes..

<br /><br />apparently being a sooky, messy ex-boyfriend doesnt always lead to the one you love hating you completely..
<br /><br />guess now all I have to do is wait til you get to the top of that disabled ramp,
<br /><br />I was driving last night and saw this disabled ramp to a building, guess what I saw at the top...
<br /><br />It was an elevator, maybe when we meet at the top of the disabled ramp we can catch the elevator together?
<br /><br />Thank you for last night, it meant a lot that you still have time for me

<br /><br />All i know is this is sorta tearing me apart, not knowing where to go... not knowing where we are... never knowing whether the first girl i ever loved still loves me... lol it sounds so stupid yet its all i'm thinking about...
<br /><br />To avoid being pushy I'm sorta taking a step back coz the one thing i know i was never able to give you no matter how hard i tried.. was space...
<br /><br />I just hope that in the end you might come looking for me... coz you've said it before and i'm gonna say it now coz i hope you meant it 
<br />&quot;i hope ur still there at the end
<br />because i always want you beside me&quot;
<br /><br />Ups and Downs i'm still here for you, i always will be... only a call/msg away... i promise
<br /><br />Love Always,

<br /><br />I never quite figured out why the sexual urge of men and women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.
<br /><br />FOR EXAMPLE:
<br /><br />One evening last week, my girlfriend and I were getting into bed.
<br /><br />Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, &quot;I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot;
<br /><br />I said, &quot;WHAT??!! What was that?!&quot;
<br /><br />So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...
<br /><br />&quot;You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.&quot;
<br /><br />She responded to my puzzled look by saying, &quot;Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?&quot;
<br /><br />Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.
<br /><br />The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, &quot;Lets get a pair for each outfit.&quot;
<br /><br />We went on to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.
<br /><br />I think I threw her for a loop when I said, &quot;That's fine, honey.&quot; She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, &quot;I think this is all
<br />dear, let's go to the cashier.&quot;
<br /><br />I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, &quot;No honey, I don't feel like it.&quot;
<br /><br />Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, &quot;WHAT?&quot;
<br /><br />I then said, &quot;Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.&quot;
<br /><br />And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, &quot;Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?&quot;
<br /><br />Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either....but at least that bitch knows I'm smarter than her.
