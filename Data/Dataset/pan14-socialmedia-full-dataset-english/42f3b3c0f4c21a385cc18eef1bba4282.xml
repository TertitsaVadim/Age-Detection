It is composed of 55 independent, locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans that collectively offered health care coverage to over 88 million people in 2003.<br /><br />For its beginnings we need to have to go back to 1929 to a man namedJustin Ford Kimball when he became vice president of Baylor University in Dallas, Texas.  He was an knowledgeable administrator, as he headed the College of Medicine, School of Nursing, College of Dentistry, and the university hospital.<br /><br />Soon right after taking the job, he created a wellness strategy that guaranteed teachers 21 days of hospital care <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYW5ndWFnZWFsbGlhbmNlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">languagealliance.com</a> for 50 cents amonth. The strategy soon spread  to other employee groups in Dallas, and then comparable plans began to crop up nation-wide.<br /><br />Meanwhile, around the very same time that Kimball was making his strategy,  the Blue Shield notion was becoming well-known in the lumber and mining camps of the Pacific Northwest. Significant injuries and chronic illness were frequent among these workers who had been in quite hazardous and hazardous jobs.<br /><br />Their employers saw the need to have to give medical care for them and they arranged with physicians to spend them a monthly fee to take care of the medical demands of the workers. These programs would later become what is identified as the Blue Shield Plans.<br /><br />As for the cross symbol, it was very first employed in a 1934 advertisement for the Hospital Service Association, which later became known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota.<br /><br />Joseph Binder, a Viennese artist, was hired by Firm secretary E.A. van Steenwyk to  create a poster that included a blue Greek cross. Van Steenwyk utilized the symbol to determine his company's well being plans and then Blue Cross began to use it in other parts of the country.<br /><br />In 1939, the  American Hospital Association, which was based in Chicago,  began to use the Blue Cross symbol to indicate that wellness plans around the country met particular standards.<br /><br />The AHA continued to use the symbol until 1960 when the Blue Cross Association was founded.
