But you know what? You eat far beyond these types of raw materials. According to statistics, McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, although on the surface of only seven ingredients, but in fact with a total of 67 kinds of raw materials. National nutrition experts William Harris, based on McDonald's, KFC and other fast-food chain's five surveys, and with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration list of common food ingredients and pigments cf analysis, lists the 10 most common fast food ingredients, and point out several raw materials may cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. High Fructose Corn Syrup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common sweetener. Fructose syrup because of its low price and antiseptic greatly welcome the fast food industry, often appear in a number of baked foods and beverages. However, doubts over the years HFCS has never stopped. It is reported that adding HFCS in many processed foods, high-calorie but low nutrition, high intake may lead to cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Soybean Oil:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2Fchristian-louboutin-pumps-c-19.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/christian-louboutin-pumps-c-19.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The most common oils or fats. Soybean oil used in fast food fried food, but also margarine, dessert of the important raw materials. Because soybean oil contains unsaturated fatty acids, not long-term preservation, hydrogenation can reduce this disadvantage. However, hydrogenated oils produce trans fatty acids, increased blood viscosity, speed up atherosclerosis, increased cardiovascular disease risk. Many European countries have begun to ban hydrogenated oils, but in China, is still widely used in fast-food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Citric acid:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2Fchristian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/christian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin sandals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The most common preservative. It exists in the lemon, grapefruit and other fruits, the acidity can increase the microbial environment, growth and reproduction of bacteria is difficult. Although the citric acid will not harm the human body digestive system, but it will promote the body's excretion of calcium and the deposition may result in hypocalcemia, and increase the risk of duodenal cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />	Woman&amp;#39;s buttocks shaped like a diamond cutting as important as a complete &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; type finishing line area, the curve of Alice Johnson always brought great joy to fashion gurus. &amp;quot;Hip shaping&amp;quot; is becoming a city of female beauty in fashion, good care of this precious line, you can not be left behind! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	1, high heels, walking 30 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2Fchristian-louboutin-pumps-c-19.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/christian-louboutin-pumps-c-19.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for a woman beloved treasures, but its function is certainly not just to women&amp;#39;s greater stature seems to pick it, there are studies that high heels boom in hip play a vital the role.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	Association of American health survey pointed out that despite the high-heeled shoes are not designed ergonomically, but it does allow women to walk when not consciously tighten the buttocks, pulling up the plastic to achieve the purpose of the Bottom Line. But I suggest women who like to wear high heels, wearing high heels every day as long as 30 minutes of continuous walking hip has been able to play the effect, to the foot bone health, life, best not to leave high heels every day feet.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2Fchristian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/christian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin sandals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Recommendation 2 in the morning from the &amp;quot;put&amp;quot; tight. The skin on the body is in a relaxed state, then put on gloves, linen rub the buttocks after every inch of skin, to &amp;quot;remind&amp;quot; the skin want to start a compact contraction. Nice Bottom massage and then cast products, the perfect call it a day!&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	a, quick swing through the lower body movement, hip place for the stringent requirements of the amplitude and frequency, can be fully hip movement, so a small electric motor of the birth of hip not difficult!&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	b, hope abundant buttocks of women can usually eat more protein and vitamin C rich foods. The former helps to abundant buttocks, which have stereotypical roles, such as the use of peanuts, almonds, tomatoes, broccoli and other materials made ??out of vegetables, salads, low in calories and good for hip curve.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;
<br />	c, the usual sedentary hard wooden chair leather ottoman into it. The chair will give a little hard hip corresponding reaction, indirectly promote muscle tight.&lt;/p&gt;

Jordan has won the annual salary of 30 million a season, but his identity is now the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats. Charlotte is a city of small ball team, the team lacks a charismatic star, leading to poor ticket sales, into a loss last season, so Jordan urged bosses to give less than the 50-50 offer, the only way Bobcats next season only want to maintain the balance of payments. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsonicebag.com%2F%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3Blouis"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://sonicebag.com//&quot;&gt;louis</a> vuitton bag&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Jordan also to succeed in its own image in the eyes of three stars fell.

It is well-known sports reporter Werner YAHOO Pawlowski said, the players in labor negotiations, Jordan kept provocative, but may take into account the identity of his former players, Michael Jordan has always been silent. In David - Stern when an ultimatum to the players, Jordan remained silent - Joe really been wronged lord! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsonicebag.com%2Fhermes-handbag-c-12.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BHermes"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://sonicebag.com/hermes-handbag-c-12.html&quot;&gt;Hermes</a> bag&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Overwhelming U.S. media reports, Michael Jordan is the leader of the hardliners employers, perhaps David - Stern talks to Jordan to participate in this cause. Jordan's hard-line leader as employer, is a very sudden news. Because before that, Jordan has been silent on labor negotiations, almost no publicly said a word. Perhaps the influence of Chinese and Jordan, Stern let him participate in the negotiations. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbestshoppingbox.com%2F%26quot%3B%26gt%3BAir"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bestshoppingbox.com/&quot;&gt;Air</a> Jordan Shoes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Stern issued the so-called ultimatum of the players, when Jordan still silent. Stern's so-called ultimatum, the threat is actually naked, almost blocked the path of negotiation between employers and employees. Jordan as a shrewd man, he could not understand this point, so he chose silence. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbestshoppingbox.com%2Fgucci-shoes-c-83.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BGucci"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bestshoppingbox.com/gucci-shoes-c-83.html&quot;&gt;Gucci</a> Shoes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Now think of Jordan's identity, his silence is the greatest support for the players. Jordan is now the identity of the Bobcats owner, to put it bluntly he was a businessman. He stood opposite the players, he can respond to loud players express their views and difficulties. Because Charlotte is indeed a small team, city of Charlotte is a small ball. If there is no fair system, Charlotte and, like many small clubs, certainly could not handle.

Christian Louboutin so angry, the YSL court. In litigation cases, Louboutin, said in February this year he has asked the Yves Saint Laurent brand stores in Manhattan to stop the red sole product, as it will cause consumers to confuse the two brands, suspected of cheating, and asked the defendant for compensation $ 1 million loss, and stop the production of similar products, but also pointed out that in 2008 he has been registered in the United States outside the red end of the design, but its owner YSL and Gucci Group were not available to respond and comment. However, YSL's spokesman said &amp;quot;red background&amp;quot; can not be seen as Louboutin's patent. Using the color red as the sole is very common practice! Back longer before His Majesty Louis XIV in the 17th century wore on red shoes, and then later the classic fairy tale film &amp;quot;The Wizard of Oz.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 204px; height: 218px&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg7.ppsj.com.cn%2F431%2F4319%2F3266989932.gif%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://img7.ppsj.com.cn/431/4319/3266989932.gif&quot</a>; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a historical point of view, the right and the red-soled shoes have always been a status symbol. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fchristianlouboutinup.com%2Fchristian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://christianlouboutinup.com/christian-louboutin-sandals-c-21.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin sandals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, only the aristocracy made the red man to the heel.
