<br />i hate to say this but i dont know what i felt right now
<br />im so numb and horrified
<br />do you know the feeling of being alone and lonely
<br />after all the good things youve done with the person 
<br />it was just ruin by that feeling. i hate that feeling. 
<br />i hate it.
<br />i dont feel love at this moment. 
<br />im so full of sadness and hatred.
<br />i want to change it but how i can change it.
<br />tomorow is for party but im not sure if i will enjoy that party without his voice first
<br />without his sincere voice... 
<br /><br />i wish i can take it back.. everything. i can take it back. everything ive done.. everything.....
<br />from him to his is not really been a good end but it was a great experience.. it just the end was worst than ever i had.. 
<br /><br />how long i can wait to feel like im in heaven, im in giggle, im in gladness, im in love, how long i can wait... so lonely... so hopeless. 
<br /><br />this is karma.. this is punishment for being sinner.. this is it.. youll not gonna make it until the end because you just dont... 
<br /><br />you just have to do is cry and cry and cry until your eyes dont feel anything at all.. and turn groggy. 
<br />you just have to do is drink and drink and drink until you get drunk and fuck up at the end.. ur fault again silly girl... 
<br /><br />im so sorry for being like this to myself.. im just so down right now. no1 can cheer me up because im waitin for him to cheer me up. so how long i will be like this.. how long.... maybe i will stay like this forever.. who knows, right? 
<br /><br />hope youll understand what im saying here. hope youll read this arlo.. hope.. i will see you soon arlo.. i will see you soon... and i think that soon is just nothing for you. but everything for me...</div>

<br /><br />my cousin is having a party at metro next saturday. i wish i can come cause i invite some of my friends to come.. i just wanna dance, i keep thinking lately, im still young i can do this later after 3 yrs. but is it ok if i can do it right now, you know just to have fun. i just wanna dance with high heels and dress up.. hehehe. 
<br /><br />i just really wish i can come. i hope my mother will have a good mood for this.. hoping...... 
<br /><br />one more thing i just wanna tell you my inspiration right now is my study.. everytime i think of something that makes myself terrible about wat happen to me 4 months ago, i always think my studies and how it will end up with success. i hope it may come through. and i hope god will help me doing this career through Christ amen.

(y is dat) because his a playboy guy who love any kind of girls that can fuck him anytime. (oh.. yeah his not the one) yeah right his not the one.. but his so sweet.. the way who look at me. the way he touch, the way he hug me, and what so on. (so what do you want to do) nothing, im not doing anything, it happen before and we had a deal, i had a deal to myself that im going to stop everything i do to him because its not healthy to my self. and my brother will get upset again with me. which i will not ruin that again. i hate it you know, cause if god give someone to love with this guy will just not for you though. it a bit unfair but i should get it what it means. the fact i really dont know what with him. his not for me totally but why i am really so into him which the fact i know his not into me. and i remembered last time i was playing around and talking about him that ill have sex with him which its my first time sex. yeah im still v.. and i want him to know that cause i told him i slept with my x before but i didnt. yeah i lied. i do lie always. i hate to do it but demons on me. yeah i feel sorry for myself and i want to change as badly as i want.. i dont have any excuses for this lies. the only thing i can say is sorry.. 
<br /><br />anyway back to the guy i was talking about.. i want him so much.. and i know thats what i always say to others too. but this one is different. we cant stop playing games  we cant stop flirting to each other. i dont know why but it feels so good. it really does. hehe. i just wish this is just a misunderstanding feeling i had right now and someday ill find someone who really i love and who really loves me back.. and if that happen i will say all of this stories will be just a feeling a had today. have a great night. and ill be having shower now cause i smell like a pooed. chao..

What i'm thinking right now is to break up with him sooner and later but i can't do it. I'm worried to be honest for what could happen if me and him are not together anymore. Everyone knows how much i love him, but i'm not sure if this is enough to keep the relationship work. Yea, i am totally denying for what i felt right now. His been asking me if i feel distant with him and i said no, i still feel the same way. But the truth i feel really distant cause i don't feel any connection at all. I don't feel love at all. I couldn't even see the point that were still together eh cause it's not working anymore. I'm loosing my love actually, but i don't want to lose the love for him. I want him to love me more. Right now he can't do that because his very broke and need to pay lots of bills. I'm really just concern for him. I couldn't even do anything, i couldn't help me like the way i use to help him because something stopping me to do it. To be honest, i'm not sure how would i handle living without him. I keep saying to my friend ill be fine, everything will be alright, its better for me and him to break up and be just friend the way it was before. But it wasn't alright, i'm sad, i'm worried, the fact that its ok with him that i let him go away from me. Thats the sad part here eh, his fine with it. I really wish i have a guts to tell him that i have to stop this and lets just be friend, and everything will be just fine. 
<br /><br />I really want to stop because lots of reason, 
<br />first, he couldn't shows that he loves me so much in front of everyone
<br />second, he got no moves at all, like no sweetness or no mushy stuff but i could be happy for your sweetness not your gift at all, cause he only thing he could be sweet is giving stuff or pressie which is not... so annoying he could even do anything that i would feel his loves towards me without giving anything. its really terrible you know. cause i can show him the way i love him soo much but he couldnt. 
<br />its very frustrating cause one more thing im trying to change right like pretending im mature enough to think that its fine if he dont contact me or anything or if he go out with bunch of girls which i think im fine with it like seriously, i dont feel any jealousy at all. my issue right now is the way he treats me the way he shows his love, the way he makes me feel the he love me so much and doesnt want me to leave or lose or anything. i know its not going to be forever but the only thing i could say is i dont care anymore. right now if i see him one day before he go back to singapore is to try to talk about breaking up if i dont see him before i wont break him up and it will continue till he go back here and will what will happen. ill just pretend that were fine but not gonna act like a very concern loving and caring girlfriend to him cause this is how he deserves to treat from me. 
<br /><br />thats all i can say tonight.. its very emotional for me though cause everything is pretending.. which lead to lies. once again lies.. hoping ill get through this. i really hope. 
<br /><br />goodnight...
