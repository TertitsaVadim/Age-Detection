My dad has been taking care of me since my mom passed away when I was 8 ( if your wondering how she died she died of cancer) Anyway back to the story. It was Saturday morning and I had just woke up. I rose out of bed and showered quickly. I slipped on a plain white t-shirt, pink shorts and black Converse. I brushed my hair, put my hair up in a ponytail and put some makeup on. All of a sudden, my cellphone beeped. I walked toward my nightstand and grabbed it. I looked down at my cellphone. It was a text message from my friend Samantha. I clicked on the message. It read Hey Ashley. Are we still going to the mall today? I smiled and texted her back yes. We texted each other for a few minutes until she arrived at my house. She knocked on the door. I answered it. Hey. I said with a smile. She looked at me. She smiled. Hey! She shouted happily. She hugged me. I hugged her back and we left the house. We walked toward her car. She unlocked it

We quickly put on our seatbelts. She put the key in the ignition and cranked up the car. She drove down the street. She drove a few blocks down the street and drove in the mall parking lot. She parked the car in the middle of the parking lot. She took the key out of the ignition. We unbuckled our seatbelts and got out of the car. She locked the doors. We walked across the parking lot and went inside the mall. We looked around and went in a few stores. After we finished shopping, we went to the food court and got hot dogs and slurpees. After we finished eating, we left the mall and went to our school gym. We went to the basketball court outside and started playing. It was really warm outside, so we decided to take off our shirts. Mind if we join you? A guy said. We looked up and saw two 2 guys. One was very tall and one was very short. The tall guy smiled. Hi I'm Alex. Samantha smiled. Hi I'm Samantha. She turned to me. This is my friend Ashley

Alex turned to the guy next to him. This is my friend Austin. Samantha looked at him. She smiled. Hi Austin. He looked at her. He smiled. Hi. I looked at him. I smiled. Hi Austin. He looked at me and had the biggest smile on his face. Hi. We chatted for a few minutes and started playing basketball. For some reason, Alex kept looking at Samantha and for some reason Austin kept looking at me. We played basketball until 8:00. We walked across the court and walked across the parking lot. We walked toward Samantha's car. She quickly unlocked the doors. I looked back at the court and saw Alex and Austin playing basketball. For some reason, I had gotten butterflies around him. We got in the car and buckled our seatbelts. Samantha drove out of the parking lot and took me home. That night, all I could think about was him. End of part 3. So what did you guys think? Leave me comments or tweet me  @AwesomeMahone please give me feedback. thanks! &lt;3

I can tell Samantha likes Alex by the way she was looking at him last night. And well I really like Austin but the problem is... I already have a boyfriend. His name is Brandon Mitchell. We've been going out for 8 months now. Let me tell you a little about him. He's the captain of the football team,  basketball team and soccer team. And yes he's hot. He has dirty blond hair and blue eyes. He's 17 and he is the guy of my dreams. I've been in love with him since I met him in fourth grade. We didn't start dating until I was 14. I know I should probably tell him that I like Austin, but I don't wanna lose him. Anyway, today is Sunday and yes I'm going to church. I rose out of bed and got ready. I walked downstairs. I looked around the living room. Then I spotted my dad sitting on the sofa. He was already dressed. He smiled as soon as he saw me. Good morning. I smiled. Morning. I said. You ready? He asked. I nodded. He got up from the sofa and walked

After church, we went out to eat then went home. I stayed at home for a few hours then met Brandon at the park (which we btw had a total makeout session for 3 hours) We chatted like crazy. So where were you yesterday? He asked. I looked at him. I told you I was at the mall with Samantha. Brandon chuckled. Right. I heard that's not all you guys did. I froze. Does he know I like Austin? He took a deep breath. Samantha told me that you guys played some basketball. Phew. I thought. I smiled. Yeah we did. He nodded. And she told me that you two met some guys. Is that true? I took a deep breath. Yeah it's true. Brandon looked at me. What kind of guys? I shrugged. Just some regular guys. That's all. Brandon gave me an are you sure look. He frowned. Are you sure there were just regular guys? Definitely. They just came over to us and asked us if they could play basketball with us. So that's all that happened yesterday?

Good cuz if any other guy ever flirts with you, I'll have to kick his butt. I giggled. Aww you're jealous. You're so cute when you're jealous. He grumbled. I'm not jealous. Sure you aren't. I kissed him. I pulled away from him and got up from the ground. He got up from the ground too. I turned to him. Well I better go home now or my dad is gonna be worried sick about me. He nodded. I smiled. Goodnight. He smiled. Goodnight. I kissed him again and went home. The next day, I rose out of bed and got ready for school. Samantha came over and drove me to school. After school was over, we went to my house and hung out. Then we went back to the gym and played basketball. Wow, I just keep running into you. We looked up and saw Alex. Samantha smiled of course. Hey Alex. Alex looked at her. He smiled. Hey Samantha. She beamed. I frowned. There was no sign of Austin. Where's Austin? I asked. He had to go to the doctor for a checkup. He answered. I nodded. Alex turned to Samantha. So I just

At my house. We don't know where you live at. I said. He looked at me. I'm across the street from where you live. You know that little white house? I shook my head. Well that's where I live at. What time does the party start? Samantha asked. 8:00. He answered. Don't be late. I'll see you guys tonight. He walked away. I looked at Samantha. I could tell she was already excited. Oh my god. We're going to a party. Can you believe it? She looked at me. No. I said. This is so exciting. I have to go home and get ready. See you later. She walked away. I sighed. She KNEW she was supposed to drive me home. Crap. Now I have to walk home. FML. I left the gym and walked a few blocks until I saw my house. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a key. I unlocked the door and went inside. I closed the door behind me. I turned on the light and walked in the living room. I looked around the room. I walked in the kitchen and poured

I walked toward the fridge and looked at it. It said Dear Ashley, I'm having to work late tonight. I'm sorry. I hope you understand. Be good. I love you. P.S. there is lasagna in the oven. Love, Dad. I sighed and walked toward the oven. I opened the oven and grabbed a mitten. I pulled out the pan of lasgna and set it on the stove. I ate dinner and went upstairs to get ready for the party. I brushed my hair, put makeup on and slipped on a pink mini dress and some flats. I grabbed my cellphone and texted Samantha. A few minutes later she arrived at my house. I answered the door. She looked at me and smiled. Wow you look hot. I smiled. Thanks. So do you. She smiled. Thanks. Let's go. I grabbed my cellphone and my handbag and we left the house. Samantha drove a few blocks down the street until we saw Alex's house. She parked near the driveway. We unbuckled our seatbelts and got out of the car. She locked the doors then we walked toward the house

She took a deep breath. Good. I could tell she was nervous. Alex answered the door. He smiled. Hey you guys made it. Hope we're not late. I said. He looked at me. No you guys are on time. Come in. We went inside. He closed the door. We looked around the house. Lots of teenagers were there. Some were dancing and making out. Let me introduce you guys to my friends. Alex said. He introduced us to three cute guys. Excuse me hot guys. Alex smiled. This is Robert, Aric and Cameron. We smiled and shook their hands. Hi. We said. Hi. They said. Alex introduced us to the rest of his friends then asked Samantha to dance. Of course she said yes. I sighed and walked around the room. There was no one to dance with. Most of the guys were already dancing with some girls. I looked around the room and went to the refreshment table. I poured myself a glass of punch. Wow. You look beautiful. I turned around and saw Austin. And boy did he

Thanks. You don't look so bad yourself. He smiled. Thanks. We were silent for a moment. Would you like to dance? I smiled. Sure. He held out his hand. I grabbed his hand and led me across the room. I wrapped my arms around his neck. He placed his hands around my waist. He looked at me. So I was wondering if you'd like to go out Friday. I smiled. I SO wanted to say yes. I'd love to, but I already have a boyfriend. He smiled. Well he's a lucky guy. Yeah he's a great guy. He nodded. Does he ever tell you that your beautiful? No but he tells me that I'm hot. He should tell you that your beautiful every day. Why? I asked. He took a deep breath. Because you are. I blushed. He leaned in to kiss me but I turned away. I sighed. I can't kiss you. I'm with Brandon. He sighed. I'm sorry. It's just that I really like you. Well I really like you too but I can't do this to Brandon. He sighed. I understand. I won't try to kiss

I unwrapped my arms from his neck and left the room. I went upstairs. He sighed. I walked down the hallway until I saw the bathroom. I opened the door. I went inside and walked toward the sink. I rinsed my face with water then dried it with a towel. All of a sudden, I heard a noise coming from the shower. It was laughter. I walked toward the shower and pulled the curtain. I gasped. I couldn't believe it. It was Brandon and ANOTHER girl. Brandon? What the hell is going on? Before he could say anything, I walked out of the bathroom and went downstairs. I walked toward Samantha. She was still dancing with Alex. They were making out. I tapped Samantha on the shoulder. She pulled away from Alex and turned around. She looked at me. She smiled. Hey I thought you were dancing with Austin. Can we go please? She could tell that I was serious. Sure. She turned to Alex. Bye. He smiled. Bye. We left the house and got in the car. We buckled our seatbelts and drove down the street

I saw Brandon in the bathroom with another girl. She gasped. Oh my god. That jerk. Are you okay? Considering I just got my heart broken, I'm fine. She sighed. I'm so sorry. Brandon is a jerk. You didn't deserve that. I sighed. And the worst part is I almost kissed Austin. She stopped the car as soon as she drove into my driveway. She looked at me. You and Austin almost kissed? I nodded. She took a deep breath. Wow. Me and Alex made out. I know. I saw you guys. How was it? She smiled. Amazing. What else happened at the party? Austin asked me out. What did you say? She asked. I told him I already have a boyfriend. Well you don't have a boyfriend now. You should go out with him. I sighed. I don't know. I think it's too soon to start dating again. She nodded. I understand. Take your time. She hugged me. I got out of the car and went inside. I went upstairs and went to sleep

I was SO pissed at him. He would try to talk to me at school every morning but I would just ignore him and go to class. I know it's rude to ignore him but he deserves it for the way he treated me. After school, I would go to the gym with Samantha and hang out with Austin and Alex. That day, I had just finished playing basketball. I was sitting down on the bleachers. I took a deep breath and drank some water from my water bottle. Hey. I looked up and saw Austin. I looked at him and smiled slightly. Hey. He smiled slightly. Mind if I sit with you? He asked. I shrugged. Go ahead. I don't own the gym. He sat down next to me. He looked at me. You okay? I'm fine. Really? You don't look fine. I looked at him. How do I look then? Upset and confused. He answered. I sighed. I don't know Austin. I really cared about him. I guess I wasn't good enough for him. He sighed. That's not true. He wasn't good enough for you. I glanced at him

I'm about to kiss the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. THIS IS SO NERVE WRACKING. Before we could kiss, Austin turned away. He sighed. I frowned. What's wrong? He looked at me. Remember when I told you I wouldn't kiss you again? I nodded. I remember. I took a deep breath and smiled. But I didn't. I leaned in and kissed him. He kissed me back of course. (Austin's Part) OMG. Is Ashley seriously kissing me? SOMEBODY PINCH ME. I kissed him for a few more minutes and pulled away. I looked at him. He still had his eyes closed. He opened his eyes. He looked at me. Wow. Did that really just happen? I giggled. I think it did. He smiled. Woah. Sweet! I laughed. He chuckled. Hey Alex is having a movie night at his house tonight. Wanna come?
