<br /><br />Coldness Of the Night
<br /><br />When I close my eyes at night and all of my senses fade. I hear your voice whispering my name, and I know in my heart that I will never be the same. It's your pressence at night in my dreams that makes me want to scream. It's your essence that makes it hard for me to wake. Do you even care that it is my heart at stake. I long to touch you, to feel your breath whisper on my skin again and again. Oh why can't this be real! All of these things that I feel. When will be over you? This I ask myself as I am trapped in this nightly hell. Will in here I forever dwell? This cold dark place with you as its face. When will feel the warmth of the light, Instead of the cold of the night. Never. As long as you dwell in my heart

Just as he went to shoot the bear looked at him, well he took the shot and his gun jammed. Well the bear came charging up to him. The athiest started to pray he said &quot;Lord I know that I have not ever prayed to you before, heck I never even belived in you, please let this bear be a Christian bear. Amen&quot; Well the next thing that he knew the bear got down on his knees and said &quot;Thank you lord for this meal that I am about to recieve.&quot;

<br />Your absence has left us here feeling all alone. 
<br />It is like a piece ot our hearts is missing.
<br />You took the pieces with you on your journey home.
<br />We showed you how much that we care.
<br />You were always there.
<br />You always came to me when I cried.
<br />It will never be the same, now that you are gone.
<br />A vital piece is gone from this home.
<br />As I sit here and think of you, I start to cry.
<br />I am writing you this to tell you goodbye.
<br /><br />Jessie You were my best friend we will miss you esecially mom. We love you very much You were our angel dog there will never be another that was like you
<br /><br />If you would like to see a picture go to my pictures. This was a one in a million dog she was very dear to us and she will be sorelyh missed, by all of us and the other animals that are here. She was very in tune to us and always came runnin at the first sign of tears. She would give hugs. When u went outside she would find a ball and follow you around the yard with it until you stopped to play with her

Beauty is not just on the outside, it is really what is on the inside that counts. I am perfectly happy with the way that I am. God made me this way. You can not judge a book by the cover. If you do not like big girls or big people then that goes to show you just how shallow of a person that you are. I am steppin up for us big girls, we can do the same things that little people can so do not judge us. That is the way that I feel about it.

<br />She told me to tell her all the things I needed to say.
<br />So I told her all my fears.
<br />She say with me,
<br />Held my hand,
<br />And wiped my tears.
<br />She said that I've been needing this for years.
<br />I'll never forget the beauty in her face,
<br />Or the serenity of the place.
<br />She told of things yet to come.
<br />Things that have passed.
<br />As I sat there it felt like I was looking through a glass.
<br />It was over before I knew it.
<br />And as she began to stand.
<br />She took my hand and kissed it.
<br />Telling me to understand.
<br />That life was never easy.
<br />Sometimes we had to take a stand.
<br />But we are never alone,
<br />God always lends a helping hand.

<br /><br />They tell me of your face,
<br /><br />They take me to another place.
<br /><br />One of pain.
<br /><br />One with no gain.
<br /><br />Help me I scream over and over again.
<br /><br />They whisper there tauntings to me,
<br /><br />Laughing at me the whole time.
<br /><br />The more I scream, the more I weep.
<br /><br />The harder it is for me to wake.
<br /><br />Why won't you leave me alone,
<br /><br />take your demons and go home.
<br /><br />Find someone else, you are going to kill me.
<br /><br />But that is your will is it not.
<br /><br />Another soul bought,
<br /><br />and another lesson taught.
<br /><br />I loved you,
<br /><br />You hated me.
<br /><br />You and your evil waited to break me.
<br /><br />When you did,
<br /><br />All I could do was cry,
<br /><br />And hope that I would die.
<br /><br />Oh but that was not to be,
<br /><br />You had to have all of me.........
