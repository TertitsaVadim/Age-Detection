<br />anyways, here it goes...
<br /><br />10th Grade
<br /><br />As I sat there in English class, I stared at the girl next to
<br />me. She was my so-called &quot;best friend&quot;. I stared at her long, silky
<br />hair. I wished she were mine, but she didn't notice me like
<br />that.
<br />And I knew it. After class she walked up to me and asked me
<br />for the notes she had missed the day before, and I handed them to
<br />her.
<br /><br />She said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to
<br />tell her. I wanted her to know that I don't want to be just
<br />friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know
<br />why.
<br /><br />11th Grade
<br /><br />The phone rang. It was her on the other end. She was in tears,
<br />mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart. She
<br />asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone, so I
<br />did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, I stared at her softeyes,
<br />wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, a Drew Barrymore movie,
<br />and three bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at
<br />me, said &quot;thanks,&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell
<br />her. I want her to know that I don't want to be justfriends. I
<br />love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why.
<br /><br />12th Grade
<br /><br />The day before prom she walked to my locker. &quot;My date is sick,&quot;
<br />she said. He's not going to go. Well, I didn't have a date and
<br />in 7th grade we made a promise that if neither of
<br />us had dates we would go together just as &quot;best friends,&quot; so we did. Prom
<br />night after everything was over I was standing at her front door
<br />step. I stared at her. She smiled at me and stared at me with her
<br />crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but she doesn't think of me like
<br />that, and I know it. Then she said, &quot;I had the best time,
<br />thanks!&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her. I want her
<br />to know that I don't want to be just friends. I love her, but I'm
<br />just too shy. And I don't know why...
<br /><br />Graduation Day
<br /><br />A day passed. A week passed. A month passed. Before I could
<br />blink, it was graduation day. I watched as her perfect body floated
<br />like an angel up on stage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be
<br />mine, but she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. Before
<br />everyone went home, she came to me in her smock and hat, and she cried
<br />as I hugged her. Then, she lifted her head from my shoulder and
<br />said, &quot;You're my best friend, thanks!&quot; and gave me a kiss on the
<br />cheek. I want to tell her. I want her to know that I don't want to be
<br />just friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't know why…
<br /><br />A Few Years Later
<br /><br />Now, I sit in the pews of the church. She is getting married,
<br />now. I watched her say, &quot;I do&quot; and drive off to her new
<br />life, married to another man. I wanted her to be mine but she didn't see me
<br />like that, and I knew it. But before she drove away, she came to me
<br />and said, &quot;You came!&quot; She said, &quot;thanks!&quot; and kissed me on the
<br />cheek. I want to tell her. I want her to know that I don't want to
<br />be just friends. I love her, but I'm just too shy. And I don't
<br />know why...
<br /><br />Funeral
<br /><br />yrs passed, and I looked down at the coffin of the girl who
<br />used to be my best friend.&quot; At the service they read a diary entry
<br />she had wrote in her high school years. This is what it read: I
<br />stare at him wishing he were mine. But he doesn't notice me like
<br />that, and I know it. I want to tell him. I want him to know that I
<br />don't want to be just friends. I love him, but I'm just too shy, and I
<br />don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me…
<br /><br />i wish I did too… i thought to myself, and I cried.

<br /><br />other boys 
<br /><br />his age rather 
<br /><br />curious. 
<br /><br />He had been hearing quite a bit 
<br /><br />about 'making out' 
<br /><br />from the older boys, and he wondered 
<br /><br />what it was 
<br /><br />and how it was done. 
<br /><br />One day he took his question to his 
<br /><br />mother, who 
<br /><br />became rather flustered. Instead of 
<br /><br />explaining 
<br /><br />things to Johnny, she told him to hide 
<br /><br />behind the 
<br /><br />curtains one night and watch his older 
<br /><br />sister and 
<br /><br />her boyfriend. 
<br /><br />This he did. The following morning, 
<br /><br />Johnny 
<br /><br />described EVERYTHING to his mother. 
<br /><br />&quot;Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for 
<br /><br />a while, 
<br /><br />then he turned off most of the lights. 
<br /><br />Then he 
<br /><br />started kissing and hugging her. I 
<br /><br />figured 'Sis must 
<br /><br />be getting sick, because her face started 
<br /><br />looking 
<br /><br />funny. 
<br /><br />He must have thought so too, because he 
<br /><br />put his 
<br /><br />hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, 
<br /><br />just the 
<br /><br />way the doctor would. Except he's not as 
<br /><br />smart as 
<br /><br />the doctor because he seemed to have 
<br /><br />trouble 
<br /><br />finding her heart. I guess he was getting 
<br /><br />sick too, 
<br /><br />because pretty soon both of them started 
<br /><br />panting 
<br /><br />and getting all out of breath. 
<br /><br />His other hand must have been cold 
<br /><br />because he 
<br /><br />put it under her skirt. 
<br /><br />About this time 'Sis got worse and began 
<br /><br />to moan 
<br /><br />and sigh and squirm around and slide 
<br /><br />down 
<br /><br />toward 
<br /><br />the end of the couch. This was when her 
<br /><br />fever 
<br /><br />started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis 
<br /><br />told him 
<br /><br />she felt really hot. 
<br /><br />Finally, I found out what was making 
<br /><br />them so 
<br /><br />sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his 
<br /><br />pants 
<br /><br />somehow. It just jumped out of his pants 
<br /><br />and 
<br /><br />stood there, about 10 inches long, 
<br /><br />honest, anyway 
<br /><br />he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from 
<br /><br />getting 
<br /><br />away. 
<br /><br />When Sis saw it, she got really scared-her 
<br /><br />eyes 
<br /><br />got big, and her mouth fell open, and 
<br /><br />she started 
<br /><br />calling out to God and stuff like that. She 
<br /><br />said it 
<br /><br />was the biggest one she's ever seen; I 
<br /><br />should tell 
<br /><br />her about the ones down at the lake by 
<br /><br />our house! 
<br /><br />Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the 
<br /><br />eel by 
<br /><br />biting its head off.The eel spit on her face 
<br /><br />a little bit and then, All of a sudden she 
<br /><br />grabbed it 
<br /><br />with both hands and held it tight while he 
<br /><br />took a 
<br /><br />muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it 
<br /><br />over the 
<br /><br />eel's head to keep it from biting again. 
<br /><br />Sis lay back and spread her legs so she 
<br /><br />could get 
<br /><br />a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying 
<br /><br />on top 
<br /><br />of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a 
<br /><br />fight. 
<br /><br />Sis started groaning and squealing and 
<br /><br />her 
<br /><br />boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess 
<br /><br />they 
<br /><br />wanted to kill the eel by squashing it 
<br /><br />between 
<br /><br />them. 
<br /><br />After a while they both quit moving and 
<br /><br />gave a 
<br /><br />great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure 
<br /><br />enough, 
<br /><br />they killed the eel. I knew because it just 
<br /><br />hung 
<br /><br />there, limp, and some of its insides were 
<br /><br />hanging 
<br /><br />out. 
<br /><br />Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired 
<br /><br />from the 
<br /><br />battle, but they went back to courting 
<br /><br />anyway. He 
<br /><br />started hugging and kissing her again. By 
<br /><br />golly, 
<br /><br />the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up 
<br /><br />and 
<br /><br />started to fight again. 
<br /><br />I guess eels are like cats- they have nine 
<br /><br />lives or 
<br /><br />something. This time, Sis jumped up and 
<br /><br />tried to 
<br /><br />kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35 
<br /><br />minute 
<br /><br />struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew 
<br /><br />it was 
<br /><br />dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel 
<br /><br />its skin 
<br /><br />off and flush it down the toilet. 
<br /><br />Jks......dnt ya tink, lol.
