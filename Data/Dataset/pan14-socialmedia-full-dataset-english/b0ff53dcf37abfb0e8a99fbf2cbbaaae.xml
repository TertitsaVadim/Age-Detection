<br />Look at who you are, just another stupid fool
<br />What didn't you understand?
<br />What didn't you get?
<br />When I said I was over you.
<br /><br />You try to guilt trip me with those looks
<br />I get pictures from you, arms with cuts
<br />Look at the state of you, you fuckin’ fool
<br />I'm so over this, just give me the knife
<br />I'll do it for you
<br /><br />You used to say you loved me
<br />But only [after] you beat me black and blue
<br />Honey your definition of love doesn't suit mine
<br />The smack of your fist, the split of my lip
<br />Was the only kiss I ever got from you
<br /><br />And you think that it's so damn easy
<br />You just walk away like it never happened
<br />Well you've got another thing coming babe
<br />I've had it up to here, don't make a move
<br />Honey this bullet is just for you
<br /><br />[Irony] You used to ask
<br />What could drive someone [To take a life]
<br />Guess what Honey you're gonna find out
<br />Your time is up
<br />The roles have changed 
<br /><br />Because now [I'm] the swatter and [you're] the fly

<br />A boy sits alone
<br />[He hugs himself tight]
<br />Heart on his sleeve 
<br />Tears fall from his eyes
<br /><br />Ocean sunset bathes him in warmth
<br />A warmth that [cannot] be felt
<br />Orange reflection trying in vain
<br />To penetrate his cold gray sight
<br />[See no affection]
<br /><br />He dares himself to forget
<br />Wishes for it all to just
<br />=Go away=
<br />Maybe if he closes his eyes
<br />The bruises will disappear
<br /><br />Orange turns to purple
<br />Purple turns to blue
<br />Twilit protection
<br />Helps the boy decide what to do
<br />[He can’t go back home]
<br /><br />And as the moon rises
<br />While the rest of San Francisco slumbers
<br />A stranger takes his hand
<br />Tells him it’ll all be ok
<br />Because he understands
<br /><br />Together they stand
<br />High upon the Golden Gate
<br />Hands clasped together
<br />A silent sign that says
<br />It will all be all right
<br /><br />Below a perfect copy of the sky
<br />Twinkles at them
<br />The moon’s double shines
<br />And together
<br />Hand in hand
<br />They jump into the moon
<br />Each with a person who finally…

School is dull at the present time...which is amazing for us! lol. Oh, but, today in Math my friends and I were talking about this person who put a fish inside them instead of a dildo....YUCK!!! POOR FISH!! 
<br />Anyways...below is a song i wrote a while ago...tell me what u think. The format is outta wack cos I cant or dont know how, to center it! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Nothing Can Compare
<br /><br />We’ve had our differences and we’ve had our fights
<br />All the harmful shit we said those nights 
<br />Those words we meant to crush our souls and destroy our hearts
<br />Have no harm because we know in truth they’re all lies.
<br />Because no matter what we’ll always love each other
<br />(No matter what)
<br />For all eternity
<br />Until we die
<br /><br />And nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />Nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />(Mmmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…)
<br /><br />Your parents may hate me and my sister may want you
<br />The stresses in life may wear me down
<br />Throw me around
<br />Kick me while Im down
<br />But I’ll always know where to go to find comfort
<br />To find solace in life’s hash light
<br />To find the strength to live
<br />To be me
<br />You’ll never take me for granted
<br />Never say I whine
<br />(No, never)
<br />But what you will do is gather me up in your arms
<br />And tell me it will all be fine
<br />(All be fine)
<br /><br />And
<br />Nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />Nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />(Mmmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…)
<br /><br />So here we lay in each other’s arms
<br />Watching the heavens and souls of the dead
<br />Flash by in form of shooting stars
<br />and when you kiss me
<br />at the moment our lips meet
<br />I can hear your heart beat out my name
<br />To the gravity of love
<br />(Gravity of love)
<br />And in that instant I know we’ll never part
<br />Because no matter what we’ll always love each other
<br />(No matter what)
<br />For all eternity
<br />Until we die
<br /><br />And nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />Nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me
<br />(Mmmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…)
<br /><br />And nothing can compare to when you hold my hand
<br />and swear your loves for me…
<br />(Swear your loves for me)

<br /><br />Broken
<br /><br />Boy, you’re broken
<br />Tears fill your eyes
<br />And what you say 
<br />Makes the world stand still
<br />You need love
<br /><br />Boy, you’re alone
<br />You say you’re ok
<br />But I know that you’re not
<br />You don’t need to hide the truth
<br />Im here for you
<br /><br />Take my hand
<br />Live while you can
<br />Let me be your angel 
<br />And take you on a dream
<br />Take you away from reality
<br /><br />Boy, when you cry
<br />Does your spirit die?
<br />When you shout
<br />Is your heart strung out?
<br />When you fall
<br />Do you lose it all?
<br />When you scream
<br />No one notices at all…
<br /><br />You’re slipping away
<br />You’re losing control
<br />Losing the battle
<br />You’re starting to fall
<br />Spiralling down
<br />Hitting the ground
<br />Something’s gonna give
<br />You’re losing the will
<br />To live…
<br /><br />Boy, undone
<br />Not long now

My friends will know what I'm talking about...everyone else will just know I'm confused. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> I wrote a poem about it...I needed a release...so I wrote it down.
<br /><br />&quot;Gray, Black [&amp;] White&quot;
<br /><br />Spiralling down
<br />Out of control
<br />Losing the will
<br />Hitting the floor
<br /><br />Closing my eyes
<br />The tears slide
<br />Finding the knife
<br />Ending my life
<br /><br />I’ve lost it all
<br />I see no light
<br />I believe that in this world
<br />There is every shade of gray
<br />Black and white
<br /><br />All the colors gone
<br />Dampening the spark
<br />That I’ve been holding onto
<br />For forever and a day
<br /><br />What do I do
<br />To make everything ok
<br />To figure out what I am…
<br />…I’m going quietly insane
<br /><br />Maybe I’ll go for a walk
<br />Maybe out in the rain
<br />Think about everything and nothing
<br />Let the tears fall
<br />And end all the pain

<br /><br />Have decided to write blog like Bridget Jones, will see how long this idea lasts as have bad habit of getting bored very quickly. 
<br /><br />8.34p.m
<br /><br />Fainted today on morning train, during peak hour, was very bad. Woke up to people asking if I was ok and helping me up whilst I was sweating and was blind with bright white dots in front of eyes. Hurt both knees in process and have been hobbling around. 
<br />Had a hectic day afterwards with Maths test in first period, English spoken presentation in third period and History exam in seventh period. Am buggered and in dire need of caffeine. Did however have a rather odd conversation during a free period with Vanessa and Lucretia about what investigators look for when a dead body is found (Lucretia was over due on homework and Vanessa and I were helping) When Vanessa and I mentioned looking for seminal fluid, torn tissue around the vaginal cavity and foreign pubic hairs Lucretia refused to right them down upon which V and I suggested she write down ‘rape kit’ instead. Lucretia had images of a rape kit containing ‘hand cuffs…etc’ so we made her write next to it NOT BONDAGE.

<br /><br />1.If I’ve got to sit next to you for 42 minutes, then personal hygiene is important. People also begin to act favourably when you bathe and use deodorant;
<br /><br />2.Your mobile phone conversation doesn’t interest me – keep it short or keep it down;
<br /><br />3.You’ve made yourself so deaf from loud music on your MP3 player that you’ve got to turn it up so all the passengers can hear it; 
<br /><br />4.If you want to stare at breasts, get a magazine;
<br /><br />5.There’s no need to push your way into the carriage – we’ll probably all get a seat (except in Brisbane)
<br /><br />6.Keep your feet off the seats or pay for my dry-cleaning;
<br /><br />7.The discussion you’re having with your girlfriend doesn’t interest us – shut up;
<br /><br />8.When you manoeuvre into the seat nest to me, acknowledge my existence;
<br /><br />9.The book, telephone, paper or magazine doesn’t reserve a seat – it’s public transport, remember;
<br /><br />10.That gratuitous display of affection for your partner is boorish  - get a room;
<br /><br />11.When you get into a carriage keep moving, don’t stop. There are people behind you trying to get on;
<br /><br />12.You might get the same seat each day – until someone else sits in it. Don’t get angry, get over it;
<br /><br />13.Don’t run the length of the platform to get on the train. There are doors from carriage to carriage on the inside. The front doesn’t get to the station much quicker;
<br /><br />14.You pay for one seat, so don’t spread your stuff all over the seats next to you;
<br /><br />15.I’m sitting down and you’re standing up. When you turn around abruptly, please be careful the bag you’ve got over your shoulder doesn’t take my head off;
<br /><br />16.Civilised humans wear pants, a shirt and some sort of footwear when outside. None of these are optional on public transport. See rule 6.

<br /><br />He can’t find any way out
<br />He’s trapped and all alone
<br />Today’s the day, without a doubt
<br />Its time for him to go
<br /><br />How stupid could he be?
<br />A simpleton could see
<br />That life’s just not for him
<br />And death is all that he can see
<br /><br />He’s unable to speak
<br />Except to cry out
<br />And all he can feel is the pain
<br />Of the hand life has dealt
<br /><br />And images of failure run through his mind
<br />Of hurt and of pain
<br />How everything he’s touched
<br />Breaks down at the seams
<br /><br />So now with those thoughts in his mind 
<br />He walks through the quad wishing he was dead
<br />He raises the gun and closes his eyes
<br />And puts a bullet through his head
<br /><br />Everything changes, everything falls apart
<br /><br />--------.x?x.--------
<br /><br />How stupid could we be?
<br />A simpleton could see
<br />That life just wasn’t for him
<br />And death was all that he could see

<br />It doesn’t matter what I need
<br />It doesn’t matter if cry
<br />It don’t matter if I bleed.
<br /><br />If I decided to pack my bags and go
<br />No one would ask me to stay
<br />No one would beg or plead
<br />Or stop me from going away
<br /><br />Sometimes I find life ok
<br />Sometimes I want to die
<br />Sometimes I want to live
<br />But everyday I ask myself why
<br /><br />But no matter how I act
<br />No matter how I’m seen
<br />I am never showing the real me
<br />Im just a masked tragedy
<br /><br />It doesn’t matter what I want
<br />It doesn’t matter what I need
<br />It doesn’t matter if cry
<br />It don’t matter if I bleed.
<br /><br />People push their happiness in my face
<br />They make me see what I lack
<br />And even though it doesn’t really show
<br />It’s fucking killing me
<br /><br />Take me away
<br />Let me leave
<br />I don’t ever want to see
<br />Your love in front of me
<br /><br />I wish this would stop
<br />I never wanted this to be
<br />I’m turning into something
<br />I don’t want my friends to see
<br /><br />I feel the stain of tears
<br />As my tears begin to flow
<br />And I want all of you to know
<br />That I’m sorry for being me
<br /><br />I’m sorry
<br /><br />It doesn’t matter what I want
<br />It doesn’t matter what I need
<br />It doesn’t matter if cry
<br />It don’t matter if I bleed.
<br /><br />And please…
<br /><br />Don’t tell me that it does
<br />Because it doesn’t to me

<br /><br />Girl: I really like you. And I... I think I'm falling in love with you.
<br /><br />Boy: Ok...
<br /><br />Girl: What do you mean &quot;ok&quot;?
<br /><br />Boy: I don't like you like that...
<br /><br />Girl: Why not?
<br /><br />Boy: I can't tell you... maybe another time...
<br /><br />From then on, the girl kept asking the boy &quot;Why not?&quot; whenever she saw him, and he kept answering the same answer of &quot;I'll tell you later.&quot; Finally the girl got fed up.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm tired of this! Tell me why you don't like me!
<br /><br />Boy: Do you really wanna know why?
<br /><br />Girl: Yes!
<br /><br />Boy: It's because you're ugly as fuck! What's the point of going out with someone when they're not pretty?!
<br /><br />Girl: But... I...
<br /><br />Boy: Just shut up and leave me alone!
<br /><br />The boy leaves and the girl is sitting there alone, crying her heart out. Then her cell phone rings.
<br /><br />Girl: Hello?
<br /><br />Mom: Sweetheart? I want you to go home, ok? I'll be home from work in a few hours.
<br /><br />Girl: Alright Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: I love you.
<br /><br />Girl: I love you too, Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: Bye Bye.
<br /><br />Girl: Bye
<br /><br />The girl heads home and once she got there, she went in the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm not pretty enough...
<br /><br />She set to work, knowing fully well what she was going to do. 2 hours later, her Mom came home and heard the bath water running. She went upstairs to find the hallway flooded so she knocked on the door.
<br /><br />Mom: Honey? Are you alright?
<br /><br />She opened the door and was shocked at the site. The bath was overflowing onto the floor, and the water was tinted red. She walked over to see what was inside and screamed. There, her little girl was lying with cuts all over her face and wrists. Her Mom backed away and was going to run to call the police when something caught her eye. On the mirror, am I pretty enough now?
<br /><br />No one deserves to be told that by someone they love. If you find it messed up then forward this to everyone you know.
<br /><br />A person's appearance doesn't count. What counts is their heart inside of them and their personality. No one wants to be told they're not good enough...
<br /><br />Repost this in 5 Min or something bad will happen 2 U tomorrow

<br />Girl: &quot;Can we do what?&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;You know, can I be your first, finally?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Um.....no.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Because, 1. you have a girlfriend, who happens to be my friend.......&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;So, if you don't tell, I won' tell.&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br />Guy looks forward and keeps driving. 5 minutes pass....... Guy starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me!&quot;
<br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br />Guy: continues trying.
<br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl
<br />Starts to kiss her..
<br />Girl: pushes him off and scoots over, &quot;Please, don't do this.&quot;
<br />Guy: &quot;Don't do what, I know you want it, I can see it in your eyes.&quot;
<br />Moves over to her and starts to unbutton her pants.
<br />Girl: pushes him harder and says, &quot;No, don't.&quot;
<br />Guy: getting aggravated, punches her and tells her to stop &quot;playing hard to get&quot;.
<br />Girl: crying, continues to fight.
<br />Guy: punches her harder, pulls her pants off, and holds her down.
<br />Girl: screams as he penetrates her, &quot;NO, please don't do this to me!&quot;
<br />Guy: puts his hand over her mouth.
<br />An hour passes.........
<br />Guy: pulls back and wipes himself off.
<br />Girl: sits on the corner of the seat, sobbing.
<br />Guy: looks at her and says, &quot;You better not tell anybody about this. If you're really my friend, you won't tell anybody. You know I love you.&quot; He reaches out his hand to touch her cheek.
<br />Girl: pulls back, &quot;Just take me home, now.&quot;
<br />Guy: says, &quot;Alright.&quot; Gets in the front seat and drives her home.
<br />2 months later.........
<br />Girl: &quot;Doctor, what's wrong with me. I haven't had my time of the month in 2 months.&quot;
<br />Doctor: looks at her, &quot;You haven't been having your &quot;time&quot; for a reason.&quot;
<br />Girl: looks at him and says, &quot;Why?&quot; dreading the answer that she was sure to receive.
<br />Doctor: &quot;You are pregnant.&quot;
<br />Girl: faints.
<br /><br />The story gets out that she is pregnant, and people start looking to the guy. He claims that it isn't his because she was sleeping with every guy in the school (which was a lie). He goes to her and tells her, &quot;I'm telling you, if you lie to people and say that I raped you, I'll kill you.&quot;
<br /><br />The Girl is completely devastated. First, he took her virginity and got her pregnant....then he lied about it. So completely depressed......the girl commits suicide by drug overdose.......
<br />Girls, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;That's Fucked up&quot;
<br />Guys, if this story touched you, repost it as &quot;I'll kill any fucker who does this&quot; if you care

<br />Chatting up our neighbour’s friends
<br />You sneak out when you think I’m asleep
<br />Out the door, down the street
<br />Around the corner and to a waiting cab

<br />Hey well, fuck you!

<br />Suitcase thrown on the bed
<br />Many thoughts rushing through my head
<br />Ripping through my clothes
<br />Off the racks and in they go
<br />CDs, books and magazines
<br />Crappy junk from you to me
<br />It’s time for me to go.

<br /><br />[Verse 3]
<br />Writing you a note 
<br />While pulling on my jeans
<br />In between words
<br />I’m tying up my Connies 
<br />“I can’t believe you’d do this
<br />You’re so friggin worthless
<br />But I guess you won’t even realise
