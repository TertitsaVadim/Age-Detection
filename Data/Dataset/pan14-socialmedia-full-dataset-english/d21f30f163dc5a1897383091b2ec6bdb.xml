Between them they have 47years employment with the police, Carol being a member of the Civilian support staff and Bob being a Police Officer. They never had any inclinations to become authors, but others found their verbal stories thrilling which led them to put pen to paper.
<br /><br />Bob was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire in 1952. He left Grammar School at the age of 15, served an apprenticeship as a Butcher then spent two years in a dye works before joining the police force on the 28th January 1974. In 1981 he was awarded the much acclaimed ‘Denis Hoban Trophy’ for outstanding detective work. On retirement he received a Certificate of Loyal Service from West Yorkshire Police in appreciation and recognition of 30years ‘Loyal and Devoted Service to the Community’. As a career detective he worked in the CID at every rank. For over half of his service he was a senior detective, retiring at the rank of Detective Superintendent. As a Senior Investigative Officer (SIO) in charge of homicide cases he took command of some twenty-six murder investigations, twenty- three major incidents including shootings and attempted murders and over fifty suspicious deaths and numerous sexual assaults, some of which were extremely high profile in his last three years alone. He received numerous commendations from high court judges and chief constables who credit him with personal commitment and professionalism, expertise and diligence as well as competence with skilful leadership in sensitive, complex high profile cases with the subsequent presentation of compelling evidence. He was a Force Hostage Negotiator and was also commended for his work into the investigation of a protracted, high profile investigation of police corruption in another police force.
<br /><br />Carol was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire in 1961. She left Grammar School at the age of 16 and went on to study hairdressing at college. At the age of twenty she was running her own successful salon as well as teaching at the college. In 1988 Carol commenced working for the Police as a member of the support staff in the administration department. As a supervisor she received a Chief Constable’s commendation for outstanding work for her determination and drive creating a poster competition for an Autumn Fall Crime Initiative involving local schools.
<br /><br />She always knew Bob could tell a good story because of the experiences he had had in his life but her nagging fell on deaf ears until in 2008 when out of the blue he enrolled them on a college course to 'Write Your First Novel’. Carol is the Chairperson of Wight Fair Writers' Circle which developed from that course and involves the community in writing competitions for all ages.
<br /><br />Their first novel, Deadly Focus, was published in 2009 and the next book in the series 'Consequences' is expected to arrive in the summer of 2011. Now the authors are full time writers it is anticipated that two further additions to the series will be published during 2011.

		<document id="fa75e36e090e180c76c38747065b2185" url=""><![CDATA[Questions and Answers!<br/><br/>PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR CURRENT RELEASE. 
<br />DEADLY FOCUS -
<br />Harrowfield is in uproar as Daisy Charlotte Hind vanishes without a trace. It’s up to Senior Investigating Officer Jack Dylan to find her.
<br />Dylan’s worst nightmare is confirmed as a body is discovered and another child goes missing, is this the work of a serial killer with a deadly focus? Dylan’s nerve is put to the test. He is attacked on the job and finds his health under increasing strain.
<br />Live the story and the tension of the investigation as Dylan struggles to find a balance between his passion for his job and his love for his partner Jen.
<br />As the killer increases the pressure, will Jack Dylan be able to maintain the impetus to catch the killer and secure justice for the victim’s families?
<br /><br />WHAT INSPIRE YOU TO WRITE THIS BOOK?
<br />Carol always knew Bob could tell a good story because of the experiences he had had in his life but her nagging fell on deaf ears until in 2008 when out of the blue he enrolled them on a college course to 'Write Your First Novel’.
<br />One of Bob’s pet hates is to watch a TV series or read a crime novel and the police procedure is wrongly portrayed. Their writing is about the truth of feelings and correct police procedure with some version of reality in the murder. ‘We would never write about factual murders as we don’t feel it would be fair to the victims’ families who have already suffered enough. But, there is something about writing something we know,’ says Bob.
<br /><br />WHAT EXCITING STORY ARE YOU WRITING ON NEXT?
<br />‘CONSEQUENCES’ the sequel to Deadly Focus will be published in the Summer 2011 by Caffeine Nights Publishers. Although, both books can be read in isolation the reader can follow Dylan in subsequent investigations in this book and his home life.
<br />CONSEQUENCES:-
<br />Detective Inspector Jack Dylan’s list of things to do is getting out of control. He has two 
<br />unconnected murders to solve of a small child and a young woman, plus a missing detective
<br /> to find. Long hours are part of the job but does he have the time to figure out the pieces to the crime jigsaws, and save his relationship?
<br /><br />Book 3 is at the final re writing stage before they submit it to their publishers. It follows DYLAN and his colleagues who deal with more heinous crimes.
<br /><br />WRITING LIFE:
<br />Bob was a detective for 28 years of his 30 year service and has performed every role of a detective in the CID office in that time. As you can imagine he has a lot of incidents to choose from. He was a senior detective for 18 years.  In his last three years as a Detective Superintendent he took charge of 26 murder investigations, 23 serious incidents including shooting, serious rapes and attempted murders as well as over 50 suspicious deaths. He was also a hostage negotiator taking charge of extortion and suicide intervention cases. 
<br />There is no magic formula to our writing,’ Carol says. ‘Once Bob has a crime scene in his mind he can then write about the enquiry till he captures the murderers, as he did in real life with all the highs and lows of any investigation he is duty bound to take charge of. When his first draft of around 70,000 words is complete he passes it to me.’ 
<br />Carol then adds the emotion. She draws out of him his feelings, she writes the scenes from his sometimes harrowing descriptions. Carol says it’s cathartic for Bob. Bob says its work. 
<br />‘There is never the case of not knowing how to move the story forward or writers block because the investigations open up automatically just as they did in real life,’ says Bob.  
<br />Did they say there’s no magic? Maybe they’re wrong, because suddenly they have a fictional story with the real life feelings of the man in charge who happens to be called Dylan in their books and his partner Jen, who are very loosely based on themselves.
<br /><br />DO YOU WRITE FULL TIME?
<br /><br />‘We are both committed to writing full time,’ says Carol. ‘Writing is an addiction and once the characters are alive in a book it is exciting to live with them to the end of the crime investigation,’ says Bob. ‘We aim to write everyday and if the writing is flowing we go with it. Writing about taking charge of murder enquiries is easy because I have been there and done it as well as worn the T –shirt as they say. How we use that experience in our writing is more daunting, partially because there's no answer that comes easily to mind, no magic like we said before, no formula. But, requests for another novel spur us on.’
<br />The couple have daily rituals like anyone else. They walk the families three dogs, clean the house, do the laundry, drink coffee, eat pizzas and love chocolate;  turn onto Emmerdale Farm and Coronation Street at night to relax and love films with a romantic twist. Carol’s office is above the dining room where Bob works at the sitting room table on his laptop. The white noise is a necessity to writing creatively for Carol. Bob can write with the radio on. Once focussed he’s not easily distracted.
<br />In between the writing Carol is the Chair of the Wight Fair Writers’ Circle <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iowwritingcircle.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.iowwritingcircle.com</a> that meets on a monthly basis. Every six months the Circle runs a writing competition to encourage others, especially children to write. The sponsorship she has found allows some great prizes and all monies go to local charities. 
<br />  ‘In our spare time we help raise money for three hospices ‘The Earl Mountbatten Hospice’ on the Isle of Wight, Overgate Hospice and Wakefield Hospice in West Yorkshire. They also benefit from our talks and book sales.
