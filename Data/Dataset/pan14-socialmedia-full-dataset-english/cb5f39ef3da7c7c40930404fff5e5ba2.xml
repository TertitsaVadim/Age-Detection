This flute is made from the very bottom of a bamboo tree, but versions now exist in ABS and hardwoods.<br /><br />Although the bamboo flute is quite simple in appearance, but it is very difficult to play; its unique and magical quality is revealed to the listeners by the purity of its tone. In the hands of a master, the flute produces an extraordinary, subtle, sensual music - prized as being perfect for meditation and relaxation. Its beautiful, soulful sound made it popular in 80's pop music in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />The name shakuhachi is derived from the term &quot;isshaku hassun&quot; meaning one shaku and eight sun (1.8 Japanese feet). Usually the term shakuhachi refers to the standard size instrument, which is 54.5 cm in length, but it can also refer to many different sizes ranging from 1.3 - 2.5 shaku (39.4 - 75.7 cm) and longer. The shakuhachi is usually made from the root portion of a thick-walled bamboo (known as madake in Japanese).<br /><br />There are two contrasting styles of making these instruments: the first involves using a style that is similar to the Zen Buddhist monks from the past. There is no filler in this shakuhachi and it is also sometimes called as ji nashi or hocchiku. If you look down the bore of a ji nashi, you can see some nodes of the bamboo protruding. While the second style has a filler made up of a certain mixture of ingredients, possibly including a powder called tonoko, lacquer or urushi and water. This is finished to create a polished surface.<br /><br />Shakuhachi can be made in one piece (it is called as nobekan) or in two pieces with a middle joint (this also called as nakatsuki). Two of them has no difference in quality, only the two piece is easier to transport and often contains filler. The top part of shakuhachi is called utaguchi - literally 'song mouth', and this contain an insert made of various materials such as buffalo horn, ivory and plastic. Its shape is based on the preference of different schools.<br /><br />Shakuhachi flute is possibly the simplest non-percussive instrument ever conceived. This instrument has no keys or pads like a western flute, no strings like a violin or guitar, no mechanism inside like organ or piano, no reed like a clarinet or saxophone, it does not even have a mouthpiece like the recorder. Zen flute has only five finger holes, which is fewer than the penny whistle or many other wind instrument. To play a note, your mouth and lips must become part of the instrument. Despite this simple construction, this instrument can produce an inconceivably broad range of musical sounds.<br /><br />The Zen flute came from China to Japan some time in the 6th century. The instrument was then adopted by a sect of Zen Buddhist monks around the 15th century. During this period, the flutes began to be made from the spiked root section of the bamboo - so the flute could double as a particularly ferocious weapon. That probably explains the flute's long association with the martial arts.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5reW9kby1tdXNpYy5jb20v" target="_blank">kyodo-music.com</a>

However, there are many more interesting festivals celebrated in Japan that originally come from China.<br /><br /><strong>&lt;u&gt;Niju Shi Sekki, The 24 Solar Terms&lt;/u&gt;</strong> According to the traditional farmer's almanac from ancient China, the year can be divided into 24 periods or solar terms, about one every two weeks. In Japan, this system is known as Niju Shi Sekki (24 festivals). This calendar was used by farmers to mark the year and these days are still printed on Japanese calendars today. Some of them are also national holidays. Some are celebrated with specific customs or foods, but most are not celebrated at all. These days include the equinoxes and solstices. According to this system, the first day of each season is not marked on an equinox or solstice, as in America, but the mid points between them. The days in bold below are national holidays.<br />&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risshun&lt;/em&gt;: February 4-Beginning of spring (Setsubun, Feb 3rd, Spring Eve)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Usui&lt;/em&gt;: February 18-Rain water&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keichitsu&lt;/em&gt;: March 5-Awakening of Insects (from hibernation)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<strong>&lt;em&gt;Shunbun&lt;/em&gt;</strong><strong>: March 20-Vernal equinox, middle of spring</strong>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seimei&lt;/em&gt;: April 4-Clear and bright (skies)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kokuu&lt;/em&gt;: April 20-Grain rain&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rikka&lt;/em&gt;: May 5-Beginning of summer&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shoman&lt;/em&gt;: May 21-Grain Fills&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boshu&lt;/em&gt;: June 5-Grain in Ear&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geshi&lt;/em&gt;: June 21-Summer Solstice, middle of summer&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shosho&lt;/em&gt;: July 7-Little Heat&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taisho&lt;/em&gt;: July 23-Great Heat&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rissha&lt;/em&gt;: August 7-Beginning of Autumn&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shosho&lt;/em&gt;: August 23-End of Heat&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hakuro&lt;/em&gt;: September 7-Descent of White Dew&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;<strong>&lt;em&gt;Shubun&lt;/em&gt;</strong><strong>: September 23-Autumnal Equinox, middle of Autumn</strong>&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kanro&lt;/em&gt;: October 8-Cold Dew&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soko&lt;/em&gt;: October 23-Descent of Frost&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ritto&lt;/em&gt;: November 7-Beginning of winter&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shosetsu&lt;/em&gt;: November 22-Little Snow&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taisetsu&lt;/em&gt;: December 7-Great Snow&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toji&lt;/em&gt;: December 22-Winter Solstice, middle of Winter&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shokan&lt;/em&gt;: January 5--- Little Cold&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daikan&lt;/em&gt;: January 20-Great Cold&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br />In addition to the Niju Shi Sekki days, there are 15 additional calendar days, collectively known as &lt;em&gt;Zaasetsu&lt;/em&gt;.

This instrument has no keys or pads like the flute that you can see in Western music. There are no strings like guitars or violins and no inner mechanisms like in the piano and the Shakuhachi has no mouthpiece like a saxophone or trumpet. Indeed the Shakuhachi is one of the simple musical instruments that you can play and get a wonderful and soothing sound from. The Shakuhachi Bamboo Flute has only five finger holes, which is fewer than any other flute or any other wind instrument. To play a note, your mouth and lips have got to become part of the instrument. In spite of its simple construction, the Shakuhachi can create an incredibly broad range of musical sounds.<br /><br />You need to take a good care of your Shakuhachi Bamboo Flute. Clean the Shakuhachi with a clean and soft cloth to remove the dust and moisture that could damage the functionality of the flute. This makes their carefree life more believable and also allows the viewer to immerse himself/herself in the series' world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;A focus on aesthetics: Iyashi series focus on the beauty and aesthetics of things. For example, an episode might focus exclusively on traveling at sea or exploring a traditional city. The focus on aesthetics enables the viewer to appreciate his/her surroundings more and makes his/her viewing experience more refined.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />The first Iyashi series is called <strong>Aria the Animation</strong> and was broadcasted in Japan during late 2005. It tells the story of &lt;em&gt;Mizunashi Akari&lt;/em&gt; - a woman who wished to become an undine (gondolier) and trains daily in the waters surrounding the city of Neo Venezia (a futuristic copy of Venezia created on Mars). The anime was based on a manga called Aria and expended upon it greatly. The qualities of Iyashi are present in the series' invigorating background music, &lt;em&gt;Akari's&lt;/em&gt; optimistic personality, the sheltered environment that is Neo Venezia and the miniature details &lt;em&gt;Akari&lt;/em&gt; learns about the city in order to become a better undine.<br /><br />Other series in the Iyashi genre include <strong>Bartender, Sketchbook: Full Color`s and Tamayura</strong>.<br /><br />Bartender follows a bartender who attends the many requests of his patrons. The series uses the relaxed atmosphere of the bar to slow the passage of time while the bartender himself is a warm and intelligent figure. Bartender uses the romantic qualities that surround famous liquors to both impress and educate the viewer.<br /><br />Sketchbook: Full Color's follows a high school student named &lt;em&gt;Kajiwara Sora&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sora&lt;/em&gt; suffers from a mild case of autism and as a result sees the world in a much more peaceful and stationary way than others. &lt;em&gt;Sora&lt;/em&gt; is a member of the art club and the series makes extensive use of nature paintings.<br /><br />Tamayura follows a high school girl named &lt;em&gt;Sawatari Fuu&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fuu&lt;/em&gt; wants to become a photographer and spends her days trying to catch the natural beauty of both nature and the human spirit.<br /><br />Albeit still being rare Iyashi series are very distinct. As the above examples show Iyashi series incorporate within them prominent aspects of the Japanese culture such as the Japanese respect for nature and appreciation of aesthetic qualities.<br /><br />Japan is one of the most renowned countries when it comes to fashion. It's no wonder that they are amongst the trendiest when it comes to style.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5reW9kby1tdXNpYy5jb20v" target="_blank">japanese music</a>

		<document id="647358c318533e113e85d0c35e489ed9" url=""><![CDATA[Japanese Zen Flute Shakuhachi - History, Information and Fac<br/><br/>One of the main issues people were dealing with was the fact that once they were moved into the government housing, they were on their own in terms of providing food and other needed items. This would be fine except that most people had either no job (their businesses were washed away) or they had no transportation (their cars were also washed away). So while the government had indeed done well in their providing shelter, they had abandoned many in need of other basic sustenance. This is where O.G.A. for Aid was attempting to provide assistance. (They have since moved on to long-term recovery efforts, such as helping fishermen get their businesses back on their feet.)<br /><br />As for how music related to all of this, I was asked on numerous occasions to perform, either during our off-hours (at the hotel or at survivors' residences) or during events sponsored by volunteer groups, such as free public barbecues, etc. I had come prepared with a repertoire of simple and familiar tunes, including many Japanese folk and popular songs. Most of the people who heard my performances were hearing a &lt;em&gt;nama&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;raw&quot; or &quot;live&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> violin for the first time.<br /><br />One such example happened one evening, as we sat with the Takahashi family (the &lt;em&gt;minshuku&lt;/em&gt; owners mentioned earlier). Early in the evening, they lamented their situation. &quot;We risked everything for that business. We started with loans, and worked for decades to pay them off.&quot; Their &lt;em&gt;minshuku&lt;/em&gt; bus was left in a ditch - a crumpled piece of debris. They had managed to scrape the gold lettering off its side. The lettering adorned their hut window - a gesture both tragic and hopeful as they began to think about rebuilding. But as Mr. Takahashi explained, they wanted most of all to not rely on the volunteers for survival. They had demonstrated their amazing survival skills in many ways: their freezer, on its side, was now acting as their bathtub; their walls were insulated with futons and blankets; their front &quot;yard&quot; was decorated with flowers, landscaped with chopped-up cherry-tree logs, and illuminated by solar-powered lights. As the conversation waned, the family's attention turned to the violin. &quot;Play!&quot; they urged me. So there, in the smokey and dimly-lit hut, I played tune after tune, each of which prompted a new response. The American-flavored &lt;em&gt;Ashokan Farewell&lt;/em&gt; brought a hush to the air. Okinawa's &lt;em&gt;Nadasousou&lt;/em&gt; seemed to bring a sense of great nostalgia. &lt;em&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/em&gt; offered a slightly more hopeful atmosphere, which was illustrated by the change in conversation following. Mr. Takahashi had seemed to forget briefly the things he had mentioned just minutes earlier.<br /><br />Others that heard my playing were not so new to the instrument, or to the classical Western tradition, in any case. One was a woman named Mrs. Sato, who heard me play in the streets of Tomarinohama during one sunny afternoon crafts activity. She said her daughter was a pianist, and that she never imagined she would hear beautiful music in that place. Mikata, the Takahashi family, the women in the Hotel school, the bereaved Abe family, the people at the 100th-day ceremony, and for the Ono couple, music had provided an escape - a breath from the drudgery of recovery; a breath that might have been the great wind on which they could ride to a better place.<br /><br />June 2011<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5reW9kby1tdXNpYy5jb20v" target="_blank">kyodo-music.com</a>

Often sparse, beginning slow and rising in tempo as the piece progresses, the rhythms of Japanese music are often based on the rhythms of nature.<br /><br /><strong>Types Of Japanese Traditional Music</strong><br /><br />Traditional Japanese music falls into several types: instrumental (not necessarily purely instrumental, may sometimes include vocals), narrative, theatrical and court music. For a complete overview of Japanese traditional music, itineraries should include trips to traditional performances of each type.<br /><br />Theatrical music: Kabuki and Noh are the two major forms of Japanese theatre. While one need not necessarily go on school music trips to Japan to see it, as Japanese theatre groups often go on world tours, watching a Kabuki or Noh play in an authentic, traditional (often centuries old) setting is an experience not to be missed.<br /><br />Court music: Called gagaku, the oldest type of traditional music was introduced from the Korean peninsula (then called Goguryeo) and includes both instrumental (kigaku) and voice (seigaku). For centuries, these songs and dances were only performed at the Imperial Court in Kyoto, but these days, performances can be arranged for school music trips and other tours. The oldest instruments (dated from around the 7th century) used for playing gagaku are the gakuso (zither) and the gaku biwa (short necked lute), but other instruments were used later on as well. Gagaku is traditionally played by musicians from hereditary guilds originally based in Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara.<br /><br />Instrumental music: Shamisen, taiko, and shakuhachi were three of the primary traditional instruments used throughout history, and these instruments still form the basis of a number of styles of Japanese music.<br /><br />The Shakuhachi Flute is Japan's most popular woodwind instrument. This Shakuhachi Flute has been used by Zen Buddhists as a tool for meditation and at the same time an instrument to play Japanese folk music, jazz or classical music. The Japanese Flute is usually made from the very bottom of a bamboo stalk or bamboo tree, but versions now exist in ABS and hardwoods. According to the experts the name shakuhachi is derived from the term &quot;isshaku hassun&quot; meaning one shaku and eight suns (1.8 Japanese feet). Another thing to remember is to keep the flute properly stored in a case. Make sure that they are kept away from possible harmful elements like direct sunlight, fire and water.<br /><br />If you want to have a Shakuhachi Flute but don't know where to buy one; you can start looking on the Internet as there are website these days that offer different types of Shakuhachi Flutes, Japanese flutes and bamboo flutes. However just make sure that the instrument you buy is of high quality materials, well-made and affordable.<br /><br />Hotter and muggier than sh*t in the underground subway, 3 musicians (YoshidaTatsuya from Ruins, Tsuyama Atsushi and Kawabata Makoto from Acid Mothers Temple) form 7 units!!

Minutes later, as the inhabitants of the Tohoku Region were still recovering from the shock, a tsunami - well over one hundred feet high in places - struck the coastline, demolishing everything in its path. Tsunami escape areas, supposed safe zones, were inundated. Hospitals full of the sick and schools full of children were submerged. Trains full of passengers were knocked off their tracks and buried in the sea water. Entire villages were erased from existence. In the town of Minamisanriku alone, more than 8,000 people were killed or went missing. To add to the apocalyptic nature of the disaster, a nuclear meltdown began at numerous reactors at a plant on the Fukushima Prefecture seashore, spreading fear of radioactive contamination the world over.

Its beautiful, soulful sound made it popular in 80's pop music in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />The name shakuhachi is derived from the term &quot;isshaku hassun&quot; meaning one shaku and eight sun (1.8 Japanese feet). Usually the term shakuhachi refers to the standard size instrument, which is 54.5 cm in length, but it can also refer to many different sizes ranging from 1.3 - 2.5 shaku (39.4 - 75.7 cm) and longer. The shakuhachi is usually made from the root portion of a thick-walled bamboo (known as madake in Japanese).<br /><br />There are two contrasting styles of making these instruments: the first involves using a style that is similar to the Zen Buddhist monks from the past. There is no filler in this shakuhachi and it is also sometimes called as ji nashi or hocchiku. If you look down the bore of a ji nashi, you can see some nodes of the bamboo protruding. While the second style has a filler made up of a certain mixture of ingredients, possibly including a powder called tonoko, lacquer or urushi and water. This is finished to create a polished surface.<br /><br />Shakuhachi can be made in one piece (it is called as nobekan) or in two pieces with a middle joint (this also called as nakatsuki). Two of them has no difference in quality, only the two piece is easier to transport and often contains filler. The top part of shakuhachi is called utaguchi - literally 'song mouth', and this contain an insert made of various materials such as buffalo horn, ivory and plastic. Its shape is based on the preference of different schools.<br /><br />Shakuhachi flute is possibly the simplest non-percussive instrument ever conceived. This instrument has no keys or pads like a western flute, no strings like a violin or guitar, no mechanism inside like organ or piano, no reed like a clarinet or saxophone, it does not even have a mouthpiece like the recorder. His powerful drumming was too amazing.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to see the final set of AMT SWR with that kind of attack and it didn't let me down. All the sets were fairly short including the AMT SWR set and played at a faster tempo than most of their other shows as the Melting Paraiso or the Cosmic Inferno. Pink Lady Lemonade has been a staple of the AMT set for a while now and I was happy to hear it buzzing from Makotos guitar at record pace. It was a short intro with the melody and then quickly into psychadelia and then nearly as quickly it was back into the melody line short and smiling and sweet. The musicians were in a sauna on stage and the crowd had it worse. It was packed and sweaty and hot like good old LA.<br /><br />The other acts consisted of combinations of the three gurus in a singing trio grouped around one mic, a silly set from Tsuyama and Yoshida playing everyday items with contact mics (including zipper song, toothbrushing song, scissor song and drinking song) a set of very famous cover songs, and some really nice ambient violin drone work from Makoto.<br /><br />These guys did this 9 show tour on an around the world plane ticket and every stop was a 24 hour layover. Improvised music for holy trinity heresy that runs the full gamut of ethnic and electric instruments, primitive stupidity, the suspicious stench of medieval alchemy, the raw power of early rock music, all leavened with a pinch of cosmic incoherency.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naWZ0YW5kaG9tZWNoYW5uZWwuY29tL25vZGUvMTEzNjA2" target="_blank">The Japanese Bamboo Flute</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2phbXJpZS5jb20vYmxvZy9lcmljNWtza3l0dGU0L2phcGFuZXNlLXplbi1zaGFrdWhhY2hpLWZsdXRl" target="_blank">The Japanese Bamboo Flute</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvMzc0OTQwX3NjaG9vbF9tdXNpY190cmlwc190b19kaXNjb3Zlcl90aGVfdHJhZGl0aW9uYWxfbXVzaWNfb2ZfamFwYW4_" target="_blank">The Japanese Bamboo Flute</a>

The goal of the game is to protect the home base and the ship. As with Nanaca Crash, the control of the game is via computer mouse. In order to protect the ship and home base, the player has to move the ship around, as well as sink the enemy ships by firing at them. The ship must then go back to the supply depot to reload its supply regularly else it fails to have enough supplies to fire at enemy ships.<br /><br />Guardian Popon has 50 different levels and difficulties. The player has to win the current level they can progress to the next level. The sheer number of levels the game has is rare in a flash game that is played online.<br /><br />Ninja Ninja<br /><br />Ninja Ninja is yet another fantastic Japanese flash game. It is a classic Ninja type of game, with different levels of easy, normal and hard difficulties for the player to choose from. Unlike the fore-mentioned games that utilize the mouse, the player has to use certain keys on the keyboard to control this game. The player has a choice of seven types of power-ups to choose. These power-ups provide unique weapons such a bomb, big bomb, hand spear, manji-syuriken, knife, i-da-ten, and tornado.<br /><br />Chaos Theory<br /><br />Chaos Theory is a Japanese flash game that tests the player's strategy planning skills. Chaos is presented in the form of fifty dots. The objective of the game is to pop all the dots with just one try.<br /><br />Hotter and muggier than sh*t in the underground subway, 3 musicians (YoshidaTatsuya from Ruins, Tsuyama Atsushi and Kawabata Makoto from Acid Mothers Temple) form 7 units!! A cappella, comic free form, progressive core, troubadour, cosmic psychedelic. The smell is infamous and it came through with an underground night of music that was not to be forgotten.<br /><br />These three virtuosos continue to amaze. Hot off the plane from their sold out show in SF they arrived in manic style to provide a sweaty crowd the lovely feelings of humor, sadness and mind blowing rock. I had never seen Yoshida drum and when he did his Ruins solo set it blew my mind. His one handed snare, his ability to switch genres mid song, his use of a sampler made me so happy that I was there as a witness. His powerful drumming was too amazing.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to see the final set of AMT SWR with that kind of attack and it didn't let me down. All the sets were fairly short including the AMT SWR set and played at a faster tempo than most of their other shows as the Melting Paraiso or the Cosmic Inferno. All sorts of ideas and aberrant musicality overturn the image of a cappella. their totally meaningless lyrics and desperate performances throw the audiences into the abyss of the laughter and admiration. Improvised music for holy trinity heresy that runs the full gamut of ethnic and electric instruments, primitive stupidity, the suspicious stench of medieval alchemy, the raw power of early rock music, all leavened with a pinch of cosmic incoherency.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuYml6ZXNvLmNvbS9CbG9nRGV0YWlsLmFzcHg/YmlkPTc4ZWM1Y2JmLTQzYzQtNGZlOS05ZGUxLTllNWI3MjBmZTA3ZA__" target="_blank">The Japanese Bamboo Flute</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWdib29rLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8xNzUzNDg2" target="_blank">Good Japanese Music</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mb29kYnV6ei5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNjAzOTQ5MC1iZXN0LWphcGFuZXNlLW11c2lj" target="_blank">School Music Trips to Discover the Traditional Music of Japan</a>

This style is similar to Western glam rock or glam metal with the heavy use of black eyeliner, metals and studs.<br /><br />Mori Girl is a new and emerging style found on the streets of Japan with girls trying to recreate the feel of a nymph or a forest fairy. There are also a number of different varieties and takes on the Mori style which totally depends upon the individual wearing it. But the basic idea behind this style is being more simple and humble in terms of one's clothing. They are those that wear vintage and thrifted items, long frilly dresses with an ethereal vibe and are concerned with the current state of the environment. This style emerged only late in the 21st century through a social networking site, Facebook.<br /><br />Streetwear in Japan is definitely something noteworthy as they try to achieve individuality and make a difference. They have a truly colorful take on personal style. They make full use of their imagination whilst taking cues from both the past, the present and the future of fashion. It's no wonder that they are amongst the trendiest when it comes to style.<br /><br />As many people know, on the afternoon of March 11th, 2011, one of the world's richest countries was ravaged by the largest earthquake in its recorded history. Ono said to me, pointing at the semi-lit portion of town that stretched across the miles of tattered plain below us, &quot;All of that was pitch black. The tsunami washed it all away. &quot;<br /><br />Mr. Torihata, the owner of a truck-driving business and a long-time resident of Minamisanriku, wept as he drunkenly asked us, &quot;Why couldn't my friends have run away from the tsunami? Why didn't they get out?&quot; He slammed his fist on the table, and questioned us further, &quot;Why do I get so emotional?&quot;<br /><br />Mikata Sho, a middle school student and kendo athlete, sort of chuckled as he told me that the only thing left standing of his house was his toilet bowl.<br /><br />Having seen much of the disaster via YouTube videos and online newscasts from the comfort of my dorm room in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I was aware of its extent, but only in a semi-conscious way. It wasn't until I stood next to the central hospital in Shizugawa (Minamisanriku), with its entrance pillars wrapped in steel bars from some foreign building, its back balcony with a fishing boat on it, and its highest windows - at over thirty-five feet - shattered with debris protruding into the sky, that I comprehended the power of the wave. I found out later that about 80 people had perished in the hospital on the day of the tsunami. A bouquet of flowers lay next to the front entrance in silent memory.<br /><br />I had been sent to the region by the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard, as one of a few student volunteers. Assigned to work in Minamisanriku with a grassroots group called O.G.A.
