And are you wondering how you can still have get email or surf the web while on the road? Not to worry because technology is here to help!<br /><br />First, let’s talk about your actual computer equipment. The kind of equipment you’re taking with you and determining how you will both store and use it is important.<br /><br />If you have a laptop, you have the freedom to pretty much sit wherever you like inside your RV – from the couch to your driving recliner to the dinette or even outside. Storage consists of putting the laptop in its storage case, and stowing it away in a safe place. (Remember, laptops can handle a little toss now and then, but it’s best to secure them as you would any other valuable, breakable item.)<br /><br />If you have a desktop with a PC and monitor, you’ll need to be a little more creative. First, decide if you’ll be leaving your PC and monitor out while you travel. For your PC, consider putting in on your dinette bench wedged between 2 pillows. For your monitor, set it on the dinette table and anchor it with bungee cords. Wrap one could around the bottom to form a circle, then use several other cord to attach it to various locations such as handles on cabinets or even the pole holding up the table. If you have other accessories – e.g., a printer – consider securing this just like your PC.<br /><br />How you’re going to connect depends on a few things:<br /><br />How much time do you plan to spend on the internet and what exactly will you be doing.<br /><br />Where will you be going and how close to “civilization” will you be?<br /><br />How much traveling will you be doing each year to offset the cost of equipment?<br /><br />TIME<br /><br />If you’re someone who just wants to check your email, and do a minimal amount (less than 1 hour per day) of surfing, your best bet is to use the PC offered at many RV parks, or those that allow you to hook up your laptop to their phone line. Both of these may be free or just involve a small fee.<br /><br />On the flip side, if you want/need to spend several hours per day checking email or surfing the web (because you’re running a business, for example), you have a few options to consider:<br /><br />Cell Phone. This can either be via a cord that connects from your PC to your cell phone and which your cell phone provider should offer. The connection is going to cost you by the minute – just as your cell phone calls do, and you must purchase the cord and software. Upside: Low cost to get started. Pitfall: Slow connection speed, charged by the minute, and possibility of having to upgrade your cell phone frequently to keep up with technology.<br /><br />Air Card. This card – which is about the size of a credit card - is inserted into the slot on your laptop (or PC, if available). Thus, when deciding on how to connect while on the road, know your usage requirements and budget!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kbWxpLm9yZy93aWtpL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1UcnktT2FrLUNhbGwtTG9nZ2luZy1BdC1Zb3VyLU9mZmljZS1SaWdodC1Bd2F5Li4_" target="_blank">Implement Call Logging In Your Work Place Today..</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyYW5zaXRpb25pbmd2ZXRlcmFuLmNvbS93aWtpL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1JbXBsZW1lbnQtQ2FsbC1Mb2dnaW5nLUluLVlvdXItQnVzaW5lc3MtV2l0aC1Db25maWRlbmNlIQ__" target="_blank">Use Call Logging In Your Head Office Right Away.</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FuZ2VsY2FwaXRhbHdpa2kuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1JbnN0YWxsLUNhbGwtTG9nZ2luZy1Jbi1Zb3VyLUhlYWQtT2ZmaWNlLVJpZ2h0LUF3YXkh" target="_blank">Use Oak Call Logging In Your Work Place With Confidence..</a>

Nearly all of us more mature men love the idea of dating a younger woman....MUCH younger....young enough to be a daughter! <br /><br />There, I said it. <br /><br />This is not to say that we have a &quot;daddy complex.&quot; No, contrary to how much this may upset older women, this is not what is going on. It's actually how we are hard-wired. <br /><br />Let me explain... <br /><br />If you go back to caveman days, life was much more about raw instinct than about cultural rules. So men merely &quot;took&quot; women that looked good to them. And the women that looked good were the ones who were the youngest, fittest, and prettiest. It was all about procreation....who might produce the best offspring. <br /><br />OK, wake up caveman. We don't live in those times anymore, but its easy to see why dating younger women is not something we should feel guilty about. In fact, women of all ages are hard-wired for certain things too. Their instincts are to look for protectors and providers. <br /><br />So, how can we make all of this instinctive stuff work in today's society? Actually it's pretty easy. <br /><br />1. Recognize what's happening instinctively beneath the surface of our culture. You already know how women are programmed...just acknowledge that. <br /><br />2. Be a MAN. Use your age to your advantage. Be someone she can look up to. Someone who has his stuff together. Someone who is accomplished....although that my not necessarily be about money. Someone who is strong....although that my not necessarily be about muscles. THESE are the things that ALL women are attracted to, but will certainly make it much easier to date younger women. If you notice, they are also the qualities that they will have a hard time finding in men of their own age. <br /><br />All you have to do is do a quick search for terms like &quot;dating an older man&quot; and you'll see how many MILLIONS of younger women are looking for guidance in this arena. Thankfully, this is becoming much more accepted in our society. This is hardly a fluke. Instinct will always win out over culture. <br /><br />So, recognize you have certain assets like &quot;experience&quot; that make you more desirable than your younger counterparts. As a result, dating younger women is really pretty simple. Invite one back to your cave sometime...I think you'll be surprised! <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9MZWVkcw__" target="_blank">Find Love</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9CaXJtaW5naGFt" target="_blank">Singles Meet</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Dating In London</a>

And often, the products or props used in a movie become clearly linked or associated with those films. <br /><br />Land Rovers are iconic 4WD and rough terrain vehicles, and this reputation is in a large part due to their repeated use in Hollywood blockbusters. Their use on the big screen has impacted their popularity on the roads, and it's no surprise that there are cult followings behind different Land Rover models that stems from their use or role in certain movies. <br /><br />Here's a list of a few movies that Land Rovers have featured prominently in. <br /><br />- The Gods Must Be Crazy (1984). Set in South Africa and Botswana, this film is a comic allegory that tells the story of Xi, a Bushman, and his band that have no knowledge of the world beyond. When they come into contact with western civilisation, a Land Rover is featured and many funny scenes ensue. For example, the bushman drives the Land Rover in reverse, and there is an infamous scene in which a Land Rover is winched up a tree. <br /><br />- James Bond (various). Moving away from the traditional safari/outback style setting, Land Rovers have featured in a number of James Bond movies, including the 1964 'Goldfinger' and the 1995 'Golden Eye'. In the 1983 'Octopussy', the opening scene features a convertible 3-door Range Rover convertible (top down) with bench seats in the rear. <br /><br />- Outbreak (1995). When a deadly airborne virus threatens to eliminate the human species in this thriller starring Morgan Freeman, Rene Russo and Dustin Hoffman, Land Rovers feature throughout the movie as the vehicle of the mercenaries. There has been much praise from Land Rover lovers that period Land Rovers were used in these scenes. <br /><br />- Sex and the City 2 - Adding a bit of glamour to the Land Rover's portfolio, a dune jumping Land Rover defender in Abu Dhabi introduces Samantha's love interest - Rikard Spirit - in this Hollywood blockbuster. <br /><br />Whether it's new or used Land Rover vehicles - in many different models - have been used and featured in a number of movies. The use of cars in movies can inspire audiences to purchase those - or similar - vehicles for themselves. <br /><br />It's not only Land Rovers that are susceptible to this trend. Perhaps, for example, the use of Peugeot's in the 'Train' movies inspired you to buy a used Peugeot? <br /><br />Has a movie inspired you to buy a certain car?<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Click For Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Find Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">Movie Here</a>

Whatever people have told you, what ever your friends, family, or co-workers have told you, HD is the only way to go. Ok you might just happen to be an individual that has never seen something in HD and that is alright, your not alone. Just about everyone in the United States has heard of HD but truly don't believe what it is. <br /><br />A simplified way to explain it is that the resolution of the image is greatly improved. Improved? One may ask, well yes that is just it. So you should go out right now and see for your self. Now back to video games on a HDTV. For starters the image is much clearer. When it is not in HD the image has what looks like to be a fuzz effect going on with it. Now if you are one of those people that have never seen HD then you will not note it and would have to look for it. But if you do have a HDTV and play your video games on it normally you will in fact observe a fundamental difference the calibre of picture. <br /><br />Not only that, if you were to play a video game that you play oft in HD and then switched it over to standard definition it would be enough to make your self displeased. Also it is a great excuse for you to go out and buy a HD DVD player. That way you can start buying HD movies and when you see an ad on TV about a flick and it says also comes in HD you can go out and buy it. The only down side to buying HD movies is the increase in cost of the movie. You can ordinarily get a normal DVD at around twenty dollars, for a HD film you will be spending up wards to around thirty dollars. <br /><br />Although that might be a lot for just one picture, HD movies come with an extreme amount of volume compared to just a typical DVD. On every HD DVD there are just about all the extras for that movie that you possibly could want. If you need behind the scenes or interviews with the cast of the show they are all there. I have personally only seen a couple of HD DVDs my self one being Pirates of The Caribbean: At Worlds End which was a outstanding film, but I know for a fact that all HD DVDs have all of the content I have just said. It is kind of like a guarantee when buying a HD DVD player. Not only do you get an amazing improvement in the calibre of the picture but you get all of the in depth reporting of the picture it self. I would say to all gamers or film lovers that enjoys watching TV in general and is looking for a finer experience save yourself the anguish of standard definition and buy a HDTV. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vY3QyODIwMTEuY29tL3dpa2kvaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPUl0cy1UaW1lLUZvci1IdW5nZXItR2FtZXMuLi4_" target="_blank">Get Some Movie Reviews.</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YWxraW5nbW9vc2UubmV0L3dpa2kvaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPVRha2UtQS1Mb29rLUF0LVdhbGtpbmctRGVhZCEuLg__" target="_blank">Its Time For Movie Reviews.</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyYW5zaXRpb25pbmd2ZXRlcmFuLmNvbS93aWtpL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1JdHMtVGltZS1Gb3ItSHVuZ2VyLUdhbWVzLi4u" target="_blank">Lets Look At Walking Dead...</a>

The simplicity of the design itself is its own selling point: anything fancier and you could easily fall into the trap of over-accessorizing. A single-stone earring is singled out for its sophisticated look.<br /><br />A diamond is 58 times harder than the next hardest mineral on earth, corundum, the stuff from which rubies and sapphires are formed. Only diamonds can cut other diamonds. Ironically, diamonds are also brittle. If you hit one hard with a hammer, it will shatter. If it is placed in an oven and heated to about 763 degrees Celsius (1405 degrees Fahrenheit), it will simply vanish, releasing only a little carbon dioxide and NO visible traces whatsoever.<br /><br />Contrary to popular perception, diamond stud earrings are not just for women! There are quite a few male celebrities who have popularized the use of ear accessories -- Johnny Depp being among the more famous of them. Respected artists like Usher and Kanye West have taken to sporting diamond earrings. Morgan Freeman wore a diamond earring to a roundtable discussion of his movie &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; in Washington DC in May 2002.<br /><br />If stud earrings ever looked elegant on a woman, ironically enough they fantastically boost the macho appeal of the men who wear them. The purity of the stone, the value of the stud, all speak highly of the man's discerning taste, his eye for refinement. After all, uncouth bad boy-types aren't the only virile types in the world -- the snazzy, clean-cut James Bond figure has also been universally identified as irresistibly macho.<br /><br />The virtue of the diamond stud earring lies in its unisex appeal. Both men and women have the privilege of accessorizing, and a single diamond stud is sometimes more than enough to set off their own personal styles. A simple diamond stud earring is timeless, and appropriately goes with the saying “Fashion fades. Style is eternal.”<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Find Films</a>

Ferguson writes, &quot;In the last five years, there has been a dramatic growth in real estate investment and development. The crowning jewel is the $100 million Emerald Bay development premier Four Seasons Resort with 183 rooms and a Greg Norman designed golf course. This development has resulted in real estate investment prices rising between 45%-60% per year but you must act quickly to ensure the best investment returns.&quot;<br /><br />As the world's premier tax haven, The Bahamas offers the perfect investment opportunity as there are no personal, corporate, income, capital gains, estate, gift or inheritance taxes. Easy access to major world markets, political stability, security and economic opportunities are all a reality of business in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.<br /><br />Since 1977, the Bahamian dollar has been linked 1 to 1 with the U.S dollar and both are used interchangeably throughout the island. In fact, I found that anytime I was to pay with Bahamian currency I was usually given American currency as change.<br /><br />Nassau, capital of The Bahamas, is a leading international offshore banking center with over 400 banks. Second in the world only to London in the number of financial institutions it holds, Nassau is renowned for its laws guaranteeing banking confidentiality. The Bahamas is trusted by individuals and corporations from all over the world. Of the some 15,000 companies registered in The Bahamas over 90% are foreign. Money, in The Bahamas, is both accessible and discreet.<br /><br />The Bahamas has been named &quot;the best financial centre in the western hemisphere,&quot; by the global magazine, The Banker, Minister of Financial Services and Investments the Hon. Allyson Maynard Gibson revealed in February of 2006. Additionally, &quot;Other than the United States of America and Canada, we have the highest standard of living in the hemisphere,&quot; states the Hon. Perry G. Christie, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.<br /><br />Now voted one of the top three international destinations in the world by The Washington Post, the island of Great Exuma, Bahamas is attracting attention not only from international media, but major resort developers, such as Four Seasons Resort at Emerald Bay. Still, the only sounds you will hear walking around Oceania Heights are the singing birds, the waves lapping on the shore and the gentle breezes rustling through the palm trees. This paradise within a paradise truly captures the elegance of luxury living all the while maintaining an exclusivity that is intangible.<br /><br />With all the amenities of a first class resort, Oceania Heights offers a welcome escape from the hectic pace of everyday life, while offering all of the conveniences of home. With visions of rolling hills and spectacular panoramic views tucked safely away in my memory I look forward to my return when I can relive those memories.<br /><br />For profit or pleasure, many of the worlds leading professionals have chosen to invest in this tax free island paradise and once you have been there, even for a moment, it is exceedingly clear why.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Depp Mania</a>

This cycle begins after his first big movie success in 'Edward Scissorhands', and covers his rise to stardom. It brings him endless possibilities. This is a highly emotional time for him, and is a particularly good time for creativity in artistic endeavors. It is a cycle of frequent sudden or unusual endings for him in his work and relationships.<br /><br />This is seen in his several romantic attachments in the early years of this cycle before he met his current girlfriend French singer-actress Vanessa Paradis. Also, his several run ins with the law fit into this pattern.<br /><br />The challenge of this cycle is for him to overcome a reluctance to accept his great personal power, and to avoid becoming greedy. I would say that so far, Johnny Depp has successfully lived up to that challenge. With his next Life Cycle 13 years in the future, we're in the midst of a long period of creative success for him.<br /><br />===&gt; His Transit Letters<br /><br />Transit letters are calculated from a person's full birth name and are the most detailed predictor of events unique to an individual. Johnny Depp, being born a 3rd, ('III' on his birth certificate,) has the unique trait of always having an 'I' transit letter in affect throughout his life.<br /><br />His transit letter of 'I' marks a time of dramatic ups and downs in his life, a time filled with creative opportunities. Remember this is in affect for him all the years of his life, except when a double 'I' is in affect (such as occurred for him in 1983 through 1991). In those years he would have great difficulties getting things started in his life. Fortunately, that period is long passed.<br /><br />His other current Letters of transit are 'OPP'. They begin on his 41st birthday in June 2004, and will end on his 45th birthday in June 2008. Their affects on his life are as follows:<br /><br />His transit letter of `O' marks a time of calm and serenity in his life. He will accept responsibilities in his home life and experience improved finances during this period. I believe this indicates that he has found a balance in his family life, and that his film work will continue to bring huge success. The 'O' transit letter will stay in force through the end of this decade, so his career looks bright indeed.<br /><br />His transit letters of `PP' mark a time of too much privacy and solitude in his life. He tends to live like a hermit. This period of intense privacy will end in June 2008 when the double 'P' changes to a 'P' and an 'H'.<br /><br />Following up, his transit letter of 'P' in June 2008 will mark a time when Depp still needs solitude, but not to the degree of the last few years. It also marks an excellent time for business and financial growth.<br /><br />And his future transit letter of 'H' will mark a time of professional growth, financial success, and independence. He should be careful to pace himself and not overwork.<br /><br />===&gt; His Personal Year<br /><br />2006 is a personal year (5) for Johnny Depp; a time in which new opportunities abound. A fitting image for a Pirate, seeing everything he touches turn to Gold.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Find Films</a>

Saltwhistle Bay Resort occupies the entire northern end of Mayreau island and the unspoilt beach shore of the windward side, which is considered by many windsurfers and kite boarders to be world class. Another reason for basing yourself here is that the famous, beautiful Tobago Cays are no distance away at all.<br /><br />You will be greeted with a tray of rum punch, and your luggage will disappear, to reappear again in your bedroom, one of just ten rooms in stone cottages, scattered around behind a screen of palm trees in a 22 acre tropical garden. This is a simple and definitely barefoot type of place, but don’t be misled because it is also extremely comfortable but very low key. The cottages at Saltwhistle bay have been built using local wood and stone, and all feature king sized beds, with a spacious bed sitting area with an ensuite bathroom. Accessible from each room is a semi private shaded and furnished roof terrace.<br /><br />It has to be described as a real Caribbean Hideaway because it is at least two plane journeys and a boat ride from home, so it is isolated. There is a little activity but not much, and the people who come here, do so to escape the speed and noise of life in the twenty first century. Most people who come to this Caribbean island resort come to read, relax, swing in a hammock and just generally enjoy the natural tropical life of a totally undeveloped tropical paradise. The bay is a perfect half moon of white sand and turquoise blue water, and must be one of the very best in the Caribbean<br /><br />To summarise the key features of Saltwhistle Bay.<br /><br />This is a very remote small Grenadines Hotel set on the smallest inhabited Grenadines Island of Mayreau, with a bar which can be lively with visiting yachtsmen, and an excellent stone and palm thatched garden restaurant which presents three good meals every day. It is an intimate, friendly hotel on a romantic Caribbean beach, with good swimming. This really is the classic Caribbean barefoot seclusion and attracts independent travellers, honeymooners and visiting yachtsmen.<br /><br />Two things still to mention about this Caribbean Island resort which relate to tnings close by. The first is the Tobago Cays, the five uninhabited dream islands, and Saltwhistle Bay Club is the clsest resort to them, being just 15 minutes from the Cays and a snorkelling paradise. Not only that you can spend an afternoon on Petite Tobaque which is where Johnny Depp was marooned in the movie ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’.<br /><br />The second thing is that you should visit the village on the other side of Mayreau where you will be able to eat some very good food at great value prices.<br /><br />This Caribbean Island resort will not be for you if you like five star pampering but if you see yourself as a traveller as opposed to a holidaymaker then this Caribbean Hideaway could be perfect.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Cinema Greats</a>

Indicators of maturity include generosity, affection and the way he communicates with you when you have issues with him or the relationship. Look out for the way he treats you and other people. If he puts you down or gets upset when you don't meet his every need, or if he disappears from your relationship every time there is a problem, then he's probably not mature enough to stand the test of time. If he gets jealous or aggressive or has outbursts of other negative emotions, you should think very hard about whether he would make a suitable partner. Your choice of partner is going to affect your future happiness. To ensure your dating success, choose wisely and choose a man who is mature enough for a great relationship. <br /><br />Compatibility Check <br /><br />Compatibility is one of the most important factors in dating and relationship success. Don't get carried away by the chemistry you feel, make sure the two of you are compatible before getting attached to him. Do you have interests in common and activities that you can do together? Do you laugh together and get on well? Are you good friends? Can you talk to him easily and does he open up to you? All these qualities indicate compatibility in the relationship. <br /><br />Effort Indicators <br /><br />If he's not prepared to make an effort for you then he's not the one for you. Period. Don't try harder thinking that if you give more he will love you for it. If he's not in touch regularly, if he's not taking you out places, if he's not interested in your company then he's &quot;just not that into you&quot;. <br /><br />Withdrawal Test <br /><br />Does he pursue you when you withdraw? What happens if you pull back a bit? What happens if you don't text or call him back? Does he disappear off the face of the planet? Does he shout or moan that he hasn't heard from you and give you a hard time? Or does he come after you... wanting your company... wanting your attention... fascinated by why he hasn't heard from you and what you've been up to in the last couple of days? A mature man who is interested in you won't want you to get too far away. <br /><br />Acceptance Testing <br /><br />As this is quality assurance then we should talk about acceptance testing. Can you accept him for whom he is or would you like to change him? A successful relationship is one in which both partners can be themselves. If you are hoping that he will somehow change then perhaps your relationship is not as solid as you would like. If you want to change him, then change him for someone else! <br /><br />Commitment Check <br /><br />Is he making it obvious that he wants to spend time with you? Is he allowing you to meet his family and friends? Does he tell you he loves you regularly? Does he buy you gifts either spontaneously or on special occasions? It's generally obvious when a man is crazy about you. If it's not working out perhaps it's time to let him go so you can continue your search for a successful relationship.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9NYW5jaGVzdGVy" target="_blank">Oasis Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Dating In Manchester</a>

		<document id="eef2da5a22689d6016a63adb3b034cd6" url=""><![CDATA[Jump Into Dating In Leeds After Dark.<br/><br/>The idea of a man dating an older woman is yet to be accepted, although it is fast becoming a new trend. After all, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore got married, right? Women who date younger men said they appreciated the strength, humour, openness, youth and passion of their partners. <br /><br />But what do the men get? It could be her air of mystery; or perhaps because of her maturity and independence in terms of money. Some men also prefer being with somebody older because they can be better lovers, with lots of experience under their belt, and they usually don’t play mind games unlike their younger counterparts. There are a lot of pros, as well as cons in dating an older woman. Let’s take a look at it one by one: First, let’s tackle the differences between an average twenty year old woman and one in her early or mid-thirties. <br /><br />The twenty year-old woman is active, determined and always bent on getting things done. The one in her thirties (and older) has obviously lived a bit more. She has probably learned a lot of lessons in life the hard way, and she’s less likely to be passionate about seemingly insignificant things, like going to dance clubs every Saturday night and get wasted. This can be a life-changing experience for a man in his mid-twenties because with an older gal, he can be laid back and have a peace of mind. Men are hopelessly clueless as to what a woman really wants. <br /><br />This is where the experience of somebody older plays a major role. A woman several years your senior has been there before, so she has already learned not to waste precious time waiting for you to sweep her off her feet. Instead, she knows just what it is that she wants and will even manipulate you physically and mentally to get it. A woman in this particular age group is more likely to have an established career and is more financially secure. She relies less on somebody to support her, which is a strong stress reliever for any man. Moreover, one doesn’t have to worry about going out with young gold diggers who are only after the money. <br /><br />However, keep in mind that these gold-diggers do become old gold-diggers, so keep a close watch on your wallet. Another advantage of dating older women is being able to have stimulating conversations about anything under the sun. Also, they know how to value the truer things in life. Unlike their young counterparts, they have learned not to play head games anymore and have less materialistic ideals. And, most importantly, a man doesn’t have to endure senseless topics like what shade of lipstick matches her eyes, and whether her pants make her butt look big. On the downside, however, older women who want to date a young man may just want to have fun with somebody energetic without worrying about having kids. <br /><br />If you are keen on having a family, you must find out if you’re on the same pole before getting serious in the relationship with her. Be sure to do a credit personality check with her, so that you’ll have an idea of just how much past baggages she’s carrying with her.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9CaXJtaW5naGFt" target="_blank">Find Love</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Dating In London</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9MZWVkcw__" target="_blank">Your Dating</a>

Another last thing to take into account is the usability of the mobile phone you are choosing. Is it easy to pilot through the list of features?

For most clientele and consumers, the relationship with a service provider or a manufacturer does not end once sales is finalised. This is why it is imperative for businesses to employ exceptional front line customer service personnel.<br /><br />Communicating over the phone is a common medium used by consumers. Companies likewise encourage their clients to make phone calls for inquiries and concerns. Much of today's organizations utilize interactive voice response (IVR) systems to provide an avenue for people to get in touch with them. To keep the calibre of service at par with the company standards, a call recording software is used to monitor, evaluate, and train staff.<br /><br />A call recording software records phone conversations between two or more parties. This allows the conversation to be retrievable for future reference, training purposes, or evaluation.<br /><br />Training a competent staff to handle customer inquiries and concerns remains a top priority of companies. Most of today's call centres and similar businesses rely on exceptional call recording platforms. This helps them evaluate employee performance when speaking to a client, save a digital file of conversations for legal purposes, and training.<br /><br />In a call centre, for instance, call recording platforms are the primary tools used to gauge how well an employee performs. Recorded calls are pulled up from the database or bucket of calls, and are utilized to carefully identify the calibre of customer service provided by the personnel. The same recorded conversations are used to effectively educate and train a new batch of customer support staff.<br /><br />This gives the staff firsthand knowledge on how a typical conversation between a client and operator goes. From there, they are taught how to assist, pacify, and attend to consumer needs. By listening to recorded conversations, an organization is able to point out areas of improvement and strength in their support department. This then helps them provide a higher calibre of service by way of training. This gives the training department the blueprint to base their curriculum on.<br /><br />By law, it is mandated for companies to disclaim phone conversations may be recorded.

		<document id="d954ecd7d35e0f0b9fafb7145b99c3f1" url=""><![CDATA[Implement Oak Call Logging In Your Business Today..<br/><br/>Everyone likes to be treated personally, like a human being. We do this by giving our own name and by using the Customer’s name. It is important to judge which form of the name or title is most appropriate. There are rules on this, but they differ from culture to culture. For example, in Ireland we use the first name in a business-to-business setting, and we use the family or surname in a business-to-home setting. It is worthwhile to investigate the social or business norms in your specific area or culture as being inappropriate can create a negative rather than a positive impression.<br /><br />4. Give a positive, definite first response. For example, ”Certainly, I’ll be happy to help”; or “No problem, I can do that for you”. A positive first response will have a reassuring effect on your Customer.<br /><br />5. Listen and use Verbal Nods to encourage the Customer as they speak. For example, ”I see; Sure; I understand; I appreciate that”. This may seem very obvious, but it is amazing how many people do NOT use verbal nods on a phone, especially in difficult call situations. Check if you do by recording a call and playing it back. If there are no verbal nods, the call will sound cold and officious.<br /><br />Questions, Good Ways of asking vs. Bad<br /><br />In Customer Service we often have to ask a series of questions to establish our Customer’s needs. On the telephone, we do not have the softening effect of body language and our questions can often sound unintentionally aggressive. Something simple like, ”What’s your name?” can be very aggressive at the beginning of a call. ”Could you tell me your name, please?” sounds so much better.<br /><br />Always soften the beginning of the question and let your voice-tone go up at the end of the question. That way you sound chirpy and the Customer will be happy to answer. Remember to acknowledge the response by confirming back or a verbal nod - ”That’s great, your number is…”<br /><br />Offer a Customer Friendly Solution or Explanation<br /><br />Having established our Customer’s needs, we move to the phase of the telephone call where we are offering a solution, or giving information or an explanation to the Customer. As we transition to this phase, we often acknowledge the Customer’s issue by summarising it, and then move to introducing how we plan to address this. ”Thank you for that, Mrs Jones, you need a … What I will do now is …”.<br /><br />Here are some tips and techniques for offering information or an explanation to a Customer on the telephone …<br /><br />1. Use relatively short sentences with one idea per sentence. Use a step by step approach with a pause in between the steps for the Customer to catch up. ”First go to X. When you are at X, you are now going to move to the next step.” Long, rambly instructions or explanations are very hard to follow on a telephone.<br /><br />2. Use Customer friendly language. Again it is worthwhile reviewing HOW you do this, to ensure that your language is positive and clear.<br /><br />We finish with a nice positive close that will ensure our Customer’s go off the phone happy.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy54bGluZ3BhcGVyLm9yZy93aWtpL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1Vc2UtT2FrLUNhbGwtTG9nZ2luZy1Jbi1Zb3VyLUhlYWQtT2ZmaWNlLVdpdGgtQ29uZmlkZW5jZS4_" target="_blank">Try Call Logging In Your Head Office Today.</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FydG9md2FyY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbWluZWNyYWZ0LXdpa2kvaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPUltcGxlbWVudC1DYWxsLUxvZ2dpbmctSW4tWW91ci1IZWFkLU9mZmljZS1Ub2RheS4u" target="_blank">Install Call Logging In Your Work Place Right Away..</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcmdvbmV0LmNvLmtyL3dpa2kvaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPVVzZS1DYWxsLUxvZ2dpbmctSW4tWW91ci1Xb3JrLVBsYWNlLVdpdGgtQ29uZmlkZW5jZSEuLg__" target="_blank">Discover Call Logging In Your Head Office Right Away!!</a>
