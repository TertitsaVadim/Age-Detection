<br /><br />Like other Obagi products, the Obagi approach to treating acne involves several products to be used in a series of steps to clean and prepare then treat and maintain the skin in a way that is healthy and effective in stopping acne outbreaks.
<br />Obagi CLENZIderm Acne Treatment
<br />The Obagi CLENZIderm acne treatment is a three-step process that uses a selection of three (out of five) potential specially formulated products depending on if the patient has normal-to-oily or normal-to-dry skin characteristics.
<br />Obagi CLENZIderm System for Normal to Dry Skin Treatment
<br />The Three Products and Steps for Treating Acne with Normal to Dry Skin:
<br /><br />-    Daily Care Cream Cleanser
<br />-    Therapeutic Lotion
<br />-    Therapeutic Moisturizer
<br /><br />Step One: Daily Care Cream Cleanser
<br /><br />The first product used to prepare the normal to dry skin is the Obagi CLENZIderm M.D. Daily Care Cream Cleanser. It is a gentle cleaner designed to remove dirt and oil using botanical extracts and soothing allantoin in place of soap, which can be drying. The resulting clean and soft skin is ready for step two.
<br /><br />Step Two: Therapeutic Lotion
<br /><br />The Obagi Therapeutic Lotion is the most medicinal of the three products because it contains the Obagi-patented form of benzoyl peroxide. It is the only common product of the Obagi CLENZIderm system used in both the oily and dry skin treatments.
<br /><br />For Normal to Dry Skin – the Obagi Therapeutic Lotion is used as a second step.
<br />For Normal to Oily Skin – the Obagi Therapeutic Lotion is the third and final step.
<br /><br />Contains Obagi Patented Form of Benzoyl Peroxide
<br /><br />While the treatment of acne with benzoyl peroxide is common, Obagi
<br /> Therapeutic Lotion contains a patented solubilized 5% form of benzoyl peroxide, a process shown to penetrate the skin more deeply to act more effectively on bacteria in the pores below the skin’s surface.
<br /><br />The oxidizing effect of benzoyl peroxide means bacteria-killing oxygen is delivered into the pores to disrupt the growth of bacteria to clear existing breakouts and prevent future ones.
<br /><br />The Therapeutic Lotion comes in a cream based designed to lessen the drying effects common with a peroxide.
<br /><br />Step Three: Therapeutic Moisturizer
<br /><br />The final step for the Normal to Dry regimen is the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NsZWFyc2tpbmJsZW1pc2hlcy5jb20vb2JhZ2ktY2xlbnppZGVybS1yZXZpZXdzL2h0dHA6Ly9jbGVhcnNraW5ibGVtaXNoZXMuY29tL29iYWdpLWNsZW56aWRlcm0tcmV2aWV3cy9odHRwOi8vY2xlYXJza2luYmxlbWlzaGVzLmNvbS9vYmFnaS1jbGVuemlkZXJtLXJldmlld3MvaHR0cDovL2NsZWFyc2tpbmJsZW1pc2hlcy5jb20vb2JhZ2ktY2xlbnppZGVybS1yZXZpZXdzL2h0dHA6Ly9jbGVhcnNraW5ibGVtaXNoZXMuY29tL29iYWdpLWNsZW56aWRlcm0tcmV2aWV3cy8_" target="_blank">Obagi Therapeutic Moisturizer</a>. The special Obagi formulation moisturizer contains Glycern to provide moisture and to protect the skin from moisture loss when exposed to the elements and contains allantoin to soothe skin from the effects of the acne treatment .
<br />Obagi CLENZIderm System for Normal to Oily Skin Treatment
<br />The Three Products and Steps for Treating Acne with Normal to Oily Skin:
<br /><br />-    Daily Care Foaming Cleanser
<br />-    Pore Therapy
<br />-    Therapeutic Lotion
<br /><br />Step One: Obagi Daily Care Foaming Cleanser
<br /><br />Cleaning the skin is the first step in the Obagi CLENZIderm treatment for oily to normal skin as it is for normal to dry. For those prone to more oil in their skin, the Daily Foaming Cleanser contains 2% salicylic acid to clear makeup, dirt and old skin cells from the surface of the skin and reveal healthier skin underneath. The cleanser also contains menthol to cool irritated skin.
<br /><br />Step Two: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NsZWFyc2tpbmJsZW1pc2hlcy5jb20vb2JhZ2ktY2xlbnppZGVybS1yZXZpZXdzLw__" target="_blank">Obagi Clenziderm</a> Pore Therapy
<br /><br />The second step in the Obgai CLENZIderm acne treatment for normal to oily skin is the Pore Therapy product. This is an additional step which also contains 2% salicylic acid to unclog pores and remove dead skin cells in order to prepare the skin to absorb the final step Obagi Therapeutic Lotion. The Obagi Pore therapy reduces residue and blemishes and leaves skin clean, soft and healthy.
<br /><br />Step Three: Obagi Therapeutic Lotion
<br /><br />For normal to oily skin, the Obagi Therapeutic Lotion is the final step in the Obagi CLENZIderm treatment. See above for full details on the the Obagi CLENZIderm Therapeutic Lotion and its patented 5% solubilized benzoyl peroxide.
