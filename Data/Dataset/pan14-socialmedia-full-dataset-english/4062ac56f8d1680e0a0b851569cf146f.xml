<br />a woman comprised of softness,
<br />both in flesh and soul.
<br />Her presence offsets the hardness
<br />of everyday living that bluntly smacks me.
<br />To be with a spirit, overflowing with joy,
<br />greeting me daily with unexpected sweetness,
<br />soothes all internal bruises from
<br />the day's accumulation of subtle brutality.
<br />Rubies belie her value to me;
<br />her natural radiance permeates my core,
<br />allowing me to experience intimacy.

<br />guided by The Word most holy and pure,
<br />I'm striving to learn principles
<br />for a sanctified life to endure.
<br /><br />My Lord loves me without hesitation
<br />and allowed a part of Himself to die.
<br />He's calling me homeward without reservation;
<br />by His Spirit, to His side, I'll eventually fly.
<br /><br />Knowing I'm a child of His,
<br />during trying times I find true encouragement.
<br />I'm able to lean on His strength
<br />while in search of heavenly ascent.
<br /><br />Stumbling forward with pained progress,
<br />I've chosen to turn myself towards Thee.
<br />On Your path, lit by spiritual Light, I'm hoping...
<br />That You will still forgive... a sinner like me.

<br />but at what further cost?
<br />Unacceptable is using fear as mind control
<br />for reaching those considered 'lost'.
<br /><br />When not as an example of victorious living,
<br />the principles of God appear to lose credibility.
<br />If not demonstrating a God that's loving,
<br />then appeal of the Kingdom lacks desirability.
<br /><br />To berate skeptical souls with Hell's threat
<br />will deliberately cause immediate offense.
<br />Salvation is not a game with souls to bet -
<br />Offer encouragement to get off the lukewarm fence.
<br /><br />Our responsibility is to share Salvation's plan,
<br />not forcing people to immediately decide.
<br />We are to be God's vessel to reach Man
<br />and not propagate the Eternal Divide.

<br />why our nation is great,
<br />an opportunity was sought
<br />by souls cowardly lying in wait.
<br /><br />Focused on pure evil
<br />as they have continually done,
<br />an unholy attack was unleashed
<br />on a day now known as 9-1-1.
<br /><br />Via the destruction
<br />of New York's &amp;quot;Twin Towers&amp;quot;
<br />the enemy crushed a symbol
<br />of U.S. monetary power.
<br /><br />Beyond the resources to rebuild,
<br />our country operates from a wealthy mindset;
<br />so we can easily overcome
<br />loss of life and some airliner jets.
<br /><br />We have forgiven peoples and nations;
<br />we have helped the World without regret.
<br />Justice will be eventually extracted
<br />for a date guaranteed that we'll never forget.

<br />but to not forgive is unconscionable.
<br />The Universal King had died for all;
<br />for in eternity's view, we're pardonable.
<br /><br />He has given absolute amnesty
<br />to everyone who has accepted Him.
<br />Make no mistake about this unmerited immunity -
<br />Grace's favor (over the course of Life) wears thin.
<br /><br />Death is inevitable, and our spirits
<br />this mortal frame will leave;
<br />so take advantage of God's condonation
<br />to be granted a heavenly reprieve.
<br /><br />Human lives hang in limbo
<br />under the penalty of death;
<br />speak kindly of others and refrain...
<br />From another wasted breath.

<br /><strong>Ellen Tanner Marsh</strong>
<br /><br />Any Christian surveying the current state of modern poetry could easily become discouraged, given that much of that poetry can only be categorized as nihilistic. At worst, such poems seemingly promote despair and violence-against society, the church, or even against oneself. At best, they consist of self-centered whining and overdramatic emotionalism, completely devoid of spiritual muscle and ethical backbone.
<br /><br />New author Joseph J. Breunig 3rd, in his fine debut collection Reaching Towards His Unbounded Glory, takes a fresh stride in the opposite direction, in a poetic compilation that should delight anyone who enjoys reading Christian literature as well as poetry. The book comprises over 100 poems of various lengths, although they generally do not exceed one page. In a slight concession to modern poetic style, some of the stanzas are unrhymed, yet all of them speak to Christian themes, such as faith and its testing, seeking a higher road, the state of grace, error and sin, biblical people and events, and personal redemption through God's word.
<br /><br />A common thread that runs throughout the majority of the poems is that individuals- regardless of any mistakes they may have made in the past-can still turn to Christ as their Savior and begin the slow, sometimes painful, but always positive process of redeeming themselves, in developing a new life filled with abundance and spiritual serenity. By reaching for this new and uplifting collection of Christian poems, readers can indeed begin reaching towards God's glory.

<br />never give up hope, for the Lord is already there.
<br />For in the time of your darkest hour,
<br />you can tap into His Dunamis power.
<br />Addressing Earth's challenges requires a key -
<br />As a child of His, you must yourself see.
<br />To assure that your earnest prayers are heard,
<br />you need to hide in your heart His Holy Word.
<br />For out of your mouth, His Word you should speak,
<br />which demonstrates that Him you truly seek.
<br />For God's desire is to help you through,
<br />but He is still... waiting on you.

<br />with the rejection of Him?
<br />Accept Christ now
<br />before your life wears thin.
<br /><br />For in permanent separation
<br />there's no God or peace -
<br />Only continual torment and anguish
<br />without any comfort or release.
<br /><br />Alone in the dark
<br />as fallen angels without light,
<br />you too will become a demon creature
<br />lacking hope of spiritual sight.
<br /><br />Forget about Purgatory,
<br />but make a decision today -
<br />avoiding Hell can be done,
<br />for Christ is the Life, Truth and Way.

<br />I see a deep indigo sky
<br />with perfect placement of twinkling light.
<br />Stars reveal the expanse of time
<br />from before the birth of humanity;
<br />their existence came from dynamic energy
<br />which was created by spoken word
<br />that no man has ever heard.
<br />Solitary spirit of awesome might
<br />painted this heavenly canvas
<br />with a flick of His hand and uttered thought.
<br />Divine creation shared with you and me -
<br />It's part of our heritage and His eternal legacy.

<br />exceeds the wisdom of Mankind;
<br />torture by crucifixion
<br />was to serve as a deterrent
<br />to stop all forms of crime.
<br /><br />Inhumane treatment
<br />demonstrates insatiable blood thirst
<br />in a vain attempt to bring out
<br />the best character of man
<br />by placing World's justice system first.
<br /><br />However, death of the Innocent Lamb,
<br />a perfect sacrifice God did decree
<br />to bridge the gap of sin
<br />using Man's worst punishment
<br />in a twist of spiritual irony.

<br />a woman comprised of softness,
<br />both in flesh and soul.
<br />Her presence offsets the hardness
<br />of everyday living that bluntly smacks me.
<br />To be with a spirit, overflowing with joy,
<br />greeting me daily with unexpected sweetness,
<br />soothes all internal bruises from
<br />the day's accumulation of subtle brutality.
<br />Rubies belie her value to me;
<br />her natural radiance permeates my core,
<br />allowing me to experience intimacy.
