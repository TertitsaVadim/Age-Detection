Little is known that female bodybuilding is one of the secrets to achieving a sexy body that many envy and desire. Gone are those days because you can have that sexy body by working out and working hard with your muscles.
<br /><br />In <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5maXRuZXNzaGVhbHRoem9uZS5jb20vYm9keS1idWlsZGluZy9mZW1hbGUtYm9keWJ1aWxkaW5nLWV4ZXJjaXNlcy8_" target="_blank">female bodybuilding</a> there are common myths why a lot of women wouldn’t dare explore this activity and here are some of them.
<br /><br />Common Myths about Female Bodybuilding
<br /><br />1. “Female bodybuilding will make me bulky and manly like Arnold Schwarzenegger.”
<br /><br />The truth is females will not grow as big and bulky like men do because they only have a small fraction of testosterone levels compared with men.
<br /><br />Testosterone is responsible in making huge muscle mass increase in men when they lift weights, in females the real reason why they grow big and bulky like those in female bodybuilding competitions is because they are most likely to be on exogenous testosterone injections and anabolic steroids, which you have no need for.
<br />2. “Doing more cardio workout and several repetitions instead of increasing weights will not build big and bulky muscles.”
<br /><br />Truth is doing more reps with lighter weights will not have any benefits in building muscle mass; rather it strengthens your endurance. You have to increase the weights and challenge yourself if you want to build lean muscles. Here’s a general overview of what rep variations can do:
<br /><br />1 to 5 repetitions build strength
<br />    6 to 12 repetitions build muscle mass
<br />    12 and above repetitions build endurance
<br /><br />Note: In following this data you also have to take into consideration the weight you are using.

Here are some of the top options to consider.
<br /><br />1. Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily moisturizer
<br /><br />This is one of the products that are suggested by dermatologists and one of the best things about this is that it comes with SPF 30.

It must be used under the makeup, and you can be sure that it will bring you the desired results. The price of the product might surprise you as well, since you can find it for $14.

<br /><br />The trick in this case is to have a lot of low-fat and fat-free foods. According to the studies that have been conducted in this matter, this is the diet that offers the best results when it comes to long term weight loss. According to it women should have a daily calorie intake of 1500 calories and men of 1800 calories. 30% of the calories should come from fat and 10% should come from saturated fat that there should be cholesterol of 300 mg. This is one of the diets that you should try in case you would like to have a nice silhouette.

<br />1. Portable Video and Sounds Baby Monitor by Bebe Sounds
<br /><br />You have the possibility to choose those monitors that offer you only sound, but this would be foolish, since you have another monitor that comes with a camera for only $200. The advantage is that it is relatively small, and the audio and video is very clear. Also you should know that the image that it offers is color, not like many of the baby monitors. You can operate the gadget both with batteries as well as electricity; the product comes with four batteries that are rechargeable. The system can be expanded with up to four cameras.
<br /><br />2. Express Bottle and Food Warmer by Avent
<br /><br />When it comes to warming bottles, in the majority of the cases people opt for using the microwave. This is a good option but the only downside is that there could be some hotspots that might turn out to be dangerous for the little one. This product offers you the possibility to set the temperature and a great advantage is that it can be used for larger bottles as well. You can use the gadget even when the bottle isn’t full, and you just want to reheat the food for the baby. Why would you miss out on this product?

<br /><br />There are many things that can bring on a hot flash with a vengeance, so minimizing these things can greatly reduce the number of hot flashes you experience. These triggers can also increase the frequency and severity of hot flashes.
<br /><br />Avoiding things that trigger hot flashes is something that is completely within your control. There are several types of triggers, first and foremost being the foods you eat and the drinks you consume.
<br /><br />Triggers can include things like caffeine, spicy foods, and more. Minimize your use and intake of these triggers and you’ll go a long way to making yourself more comfortable.
<br /><br />Additionally, there are elements in your environment that can trigger a hot flash episode, such as heat, stress, alcohol, tight clothing, and other similar things. So pay attention to your environment and take measures to make sure you control it so that you can avoid hot flashes in the first place.

<br /><br />The study, titled Maternal and fetal exposure to pesticides associated to genetically modified foods in Eastern Townships of Quebec, Canada looked at whether there was a correlation between maternal and fetal exposure to pesticides associated with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) by sampling the blood of 30 pregnant women and 39 nonpregnant women.
<br /><br />In addition, the cord blood of the pregnancy women’s babies was also analyzed.
<br /><br />The agricultural chemicals tested included herbicides and insecticides including the following:
<br /><br />Glyphosate, brand name Roundup
<br />    Gluphosinate, a broad-spectrum herbicide
<br />    AMPA, aminomethyl phosphoric acid, a metabolite of glyphosate
<br />    3-MMPA, 3-methylphosphinico propionic acid, a metabolite of gluphosinate
<br />    Cry1Ab, the Bt toxin of gluphosinate
<br /><br />The study concluded that yes, indeed, in some cases, agricultural chemicals are able to survive a woman’s digestive system, move from there into the pregnant woman’s bloodstream, and from there be passed on to the developing infant.

Mothers do their best to improve their cognitive response starting from the first pregnancy weeks but once they come into the world, the real work starts.
<br /><br />Babies, toddlers and preschoolers have hungry little minds ready to absorb the information…sometimes against our better judgment. The little ones are eager to discover and register. The most tempting aspects of their learning process are the ones that are more colorful.
<br /><br />Depending on their age group the children are able to remember information from a very early age. According to pediatric science the little minds become receptive to information and memory around the age of 6 months. From that moment on, the baby can learn a large number of things.
<br /><br />Here are some of the best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXdib3JuYmFieXpvbmUuY29tL2JhYnktY2FyZS9lZHVjYXRpb25hbC1nYW1lcy1mb3Ita2lkcy8_" target="_blank">educational games for kids</a> depending upon their age:
<br />Educational games for babies
<br /><br />Your little baby can start learning very interesting things through games. Educational baby games can take the place of fun activities that can help your little one to get in touch with the world and perceive you as the most important factor in communicating with it.
<br />1. Learning Colors
<br /><br />Baby shapes can be a very handy tool in teaching the baby to recognize the colors and geometrical shapes. You should focus on helping the little one recognize the difference between the shapes and he or she will differentiate the colors too. This educational game for babies helps with visual recognition, not to mention that they help a great deal in increasing the baby’s attention span.

Forget those crazy diet fads and instead turn to these sensible, sustainable diets that are easy to follow and highly effective.
<br />1. The Lunchbox Diet
<br /><br />Harkening back to childhood meal routines, the lunchbox diet is one of the newest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5maXRuZXNzaGVhbHRoem9uZS5jb20vZGlldC1udXRyaXRpb24vY2VsZWJyaXR5LWRpZXRzLWZvci13ZWlnaHQtbG9zcy8_" target="_blank">celebrity diets</a> to take the world by storm. Elegant in its simplicity, the lunchbox diet uses old-world wisdom combined with fun techniques to help you lose weight naturally without fads or crazy, unhealthy food choices.
<br /><br />The lunchbox diet relies on some simple tenants devised by Simon Lovell. If you’re a follower of this diet, you’ll get a good sized lunch box (whatever pattern suits your fancy!) and fill it full of delicious, yet healthy foods that you can graze on throughout the day. You might include things like veggies, muesli, poached eggs, wholewheat toast, cheese, watermelon cubes, and sesame seeds.
<br /><br />The diet encourages a balanced mix of health carbohydrates and protein to ensure you’re getting all of the nutrition you need. This diet has been used by Fergie, Keira Knightley and Cameron Diaz.
<br />2. Vegetarianism
<br /><br />Another happy trend for animal lovers is the popularity of vegetarian and vegan diets among celebrities. Espoused by celebrities like Tobey Maguire, Olivia Wilde, Carrie Underwood, and Gwyneth Paltrow, vegetarians and vegans eat no meat and may eliminate things like dairy, eggs, and other animal-derived foods and ingredients. Eating less meat has been proven to reduce the fat in a person’s diet, which can go a long way to help you maintain a healthy weight.
<br /><br />celebrity dietsNot only that, but vegetarians tend to live longer, have lower rates of heart disease and cancer, and have reduced incidences of bone disease as well!
<br /><br />Plus, when done right, vegetarians tend to eat more whole grains, beans, legumes, and other healthy carbohydrates which help to keep the body healthy and nourished. Even if you can’t go meat free the entire time, consider becoming a weekday vegetarian – eating meat only on the weekends and refraining the rest of the week.

Help prevent the formation of these dangerous diseases with some important lifestyle changes.
<br />1. Know your family history
<br /><br />If your family has a history of either breast cancer or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b21lbmhlYWx0aHpvbmUuY29tL3dvbWVucy1oZWFsdGgvYnJlYXN0LWNhbmNlci9jb2xvbi1hbmQtYnJlYXN0LWNhbmNlci1wcmV2ZW50aW9uLw__" target="_blank">colon cancer,</a> your changes may be higher than the average woman. Knowing your family history is therefore very helpful when talking to your doctor about tests and screenings. Poll your family members to find out if any relatives have suffered from either breast or colon cancer and be sure to alert your doctor if you find any incidence of these diseases in your family tree.
<br /><br />A family history may warrant earlier and more regular screenings to catch disease formation early.
<br />2. Get screened regularly
<br /><br />One of the best ways for breast cancer prevention is to catch it before it starts, and that means regular breast cancer screenings. There are three tests generally used for this purpose. Every woman should be doing her own self-exams of her breasts every single month. Talk to your doctor about how to conduct a self-exam. Additionally, women should see their doctors every year for an annual physical, which should include a clinical breast exam.
<br /><br />The mammogram is an x-ray of the breast and should be performed every two years if you are between the ages of 50 and 74. Some women should be screened before the age of 50 if family history or other risk factors are present.
<br />3. Have regular polyp removal
<br /><br />If you have a family history of colon cancer, or have had tests (such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) to determine that you have colorectal polyps, you should ensure that you have regular appointments with your doctor to have the polyps removed. These adenomas have been shown to develop into colon cancer, and removing those that are larger than 1 cm has been show to lower the risk of colorectal cancer significantly.

Here are some foods to avoid when pregnant that can seriously harm you both if you’re not careful.
<br /><br />1. Raw, undercooked seafood
<br /><br />Undercooked and raw seafood can contain harmful bacteria and viruses that are unhealthy for you and for your growing baby. You should definitely avoid oysters and clams during your pregnancy, but also be sure to pay attention to local fish advisories that explain particular health concerns in your area.
<br /><br />This is especially true when water pollution is of concern. Regardless of the seafood you’re eating, be sure to cook it thoroughly to kill as much bacteria and viruses as possible.
<br />2. Deli meat
<br /><br />Known to potentially be contaminated with listeria, a compound that can contribute to miscarriages by crossing the placenta wall and infecting the baby, deli meats are one food you should not have on your pregnancy menu.
<br /><br />This category also includes things like hot dogs, meat spreads, and raw pre-stuffed poultry foods. Instead, choose healthier proteins like beans, legumes, lentils, soy, and organic meats and seafood. If you can’t live without your deli meats, ensure that you reheat them until they are steaming.
