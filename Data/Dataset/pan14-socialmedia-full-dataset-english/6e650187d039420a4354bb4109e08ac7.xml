<br /><br />Couples who live together are more than twice as likely to become obese than those who live separately, new research shows.
<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXRjaGVzLXNwYWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">wholesale watch</a>   study to be published next month in the journal Obesity also showed that the risk of obesity rises the longer people live together.
<br /><br />Penny Gordon-Larsen, associate professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, found some positive health benefits to marriage, including decreased cigarette smoking and lower mortality.
<br /><br />But she added: &quot;We also see greater weight gain than in others of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXRjaGVzLXNwYWNlLmNvbS9CYXVtZS1NZXJjaWVyLVdhdGNoZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Baume Mercier Watches</a>  same age, and greater risk of obesity.
<br /><br />&quot;Maybe the cause of weight gain is not just age, but the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXRjaGVzLXNwYWNlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">replica watches</a>  pressure of shifting behaviours that result in weight gain.&quot;
