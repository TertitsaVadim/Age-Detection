<br /><br />Re : I'm helping my mum to register for the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WIS).  It's said that we're to register b4 we pay can make any payment @ any AXS machines islandwide. But as my mum had already registered for any other scheme previously, I thought we could skip this step. So we made a payment @ an AXS machine near our hse.  It was only later that CPF sent back a chq that we know that we HAD to register 1st. Hai . . .  So my mum &amp; I went to the nearest CPF to register.

It's my mum's side's relative's son's wedding. It's a malay style wedding as there r 2 long tables of food 4 u 2 take your food fr. But the food on the 2 tables r the same. Than after putting the food on your plate, u can go &amp; find a table w/ chairs to sit down &amp; enjoy your food. As we had to rush back in time to cook dinner 4 my bro, we left early (b4 the bride &amp; bridegroom is here). It's a pity thought as normally malay brides r very beautiful. This is due to the assories on their head &amp; the traditional dress the bride's wearing. It's just very very beautiful. B4 we left the place, we were given a 'thank you gift'. It's a traditional in malay weddings to your guests a thank you gift when they arrive or b4 they leave the place.

<br /><br />In a nutshell, it was a very fruitful day.

<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">CNY Day 1 &amp; Day 2</span>
<br />Today’s the day again.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> IT’S CNY!  Yeah!  Yippee!
<br /><br /><em>Day 1</em>
<br />As usual, I woke up early in the morning to help my mum prepare the 1st breakfast of the lunar year.  After that we’ll wait . . .  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> . . . wait for my cousins to come.  Than IT’S RESTING TIME!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> Yes I love it.  I rested till early evening b4 I start preparing dinner with my mum.  As usual, my uncle &amp; his family are coming for dinner.  His children just simply loved to come to our house. Re : They can eat, play &amp; pack home if they can’t stuff in but still wish to eat some more.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br /><em>Day 2</em>
<br />As usual, my family &amp; I went to one of my aunt’s house. Stayed there for a hr plus b4 setting off to one of my uncle’s house in Jr where we stayed for a hr plus.  Next, we went off to my favorite place : my uncle’s house in Bt Panjang!  We stayed there the longest. Cos we always stayed to hv dinner.  This yr, my cousin decided to cook spaghetti for us to eat.  Hai . . . I’ve finally get a chance to taste her cooking.  After having dinner, both families set off to our last stop : another one of my aunt’s house. Where we stayed for an hr plus b4 we head back home for a gd night’s rest.  Cos we still got to get up early the next morning to get to work.
<br /><br />Yeah I know.  The ‘as usual’ thing looks so boring.  Nothing unusual, nothing special.  It’s not happening.  But it’s OK.  Cos being together is the MOST impt thing. And I enjoyed the feeling of being together.

<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">CNY Dinner @ Blk 624</span>
<br />Tonight I’ve to attend a CNY dinner with my mum organised by one of the RCs near my hse.  The food was ok loh.  The performance was nothing as it’s just some ppl singing karaoke only.  And of course some lion dance.  But anyway, I did had my own fun though.  I did have fun chatting with the aunties and drinking some red wine they’ve bought by themselves.  So on the whole, it’s ok lah.  Most impt thing is I did enjoy myself.  And I think my mum enjoyed herself too.

<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">CNY Dinner @ YCKCC</span>
<br />Tonight I’ve to attend a CNY dinner with my mum organised by YCKCC.  The food tasted better than the RC’s CNY dinner.  Although the rest. was the same one.  The food just tasted better. I don’t know y but it is so.  I guess the environment did play a part too.  Cos the CC’s dinner is in the hall where there’s air-con.  The performance was the same.  Just some ppl singing karaoke on stage.  But the diff is that there’s a space for ppl to dance (if u like).  And of course some lion dance too. But anyway, I did had my own fun.  I did have fun chatting with the aunties and drinking some red wine they’ve bought by themselves.  So on the whole, it’s ok also.  Most impt thing is I did enjoy myself.  And I think my mum enjoyed herself too.

<br />OMG!  What a chaotic afternoon!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> I had some miscommunication with my friend CY over the HP.  I was waiting for CY @ AMK while CY was waiting for me @ Sengkang.  We didn’t realized it @ 1st.  Cos both places hv MRT, hv Body shop, hv bus interchange with bus no.86.  It was only when CY said ‘Metro’ that I known we’re @ different places.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> Cos AMK got no Metro.  So in the end we arranged to meet @ another MRT station.  We originally planed to reach Boon Keng b4 12.00pm but in the end we reached @ about 1.30pm.  So we decided to hv our lunch 1st.  @ 1st I wanted to bring CY to eat chicken rice but unfortunately we were unable to find it.  So we decided to hv our lunch @ Mac instead.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> Than we took a cab to our friend’s mum’s hse.  We stayed there for about 2 hrs chatting &amp; playing with her son.  Than I brought CY to two arcades where I spent about $60 altogether &amp; CY spent about $70.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> We both brought home 2 bags of sweets &amp; 2 soft toys (a pig &amp; an elephant).  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />There’s a blood donation drive @ YCKCC.  After registering, I went to have a basic check-up by the doc &amp; nurses.  Than I went to the donation bed to donate my blood.  After the blood donation, I was bandaged.  And the little squeeze toy that I was given to help the flow of blood &amp; some pills to help replace the iron lost in the donation were given to me as a thank you gift.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> Than I went to the refreshment corner to hv some of the drinks &amp; biscuits provided.  Cos after donating blood, the donor’s BP will tend to drop a little.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sick.gif" alt=":)" /> That’s y if u 1 2 donate blood, your BP hv to be a bit higher.  After the donation, a rest &amp; some refreshment is needed.  This will help push up the donor’s BP.  At the end of the day the CC managed to help collect  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> <strong>105</strong> bags  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> of blood for the National Blood Bank of Singapore.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> That could help save quite a no. of lives u know.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Tomorrow (22/03/09) morning we’re going to pay our respects to my grandfathers &amp; grandmothers.  Today (21/03/09), I went to the market to buy most of the things we need for the praying.  This way tomorrow morning we wouldn’t hv to rush like hell &amp; panic.  The next day, as per planned, my family &amp; I got up real early.  Went to the market to hv our breakfast, took &amp; bought all the things we needed for the praying.  Than we set off to Guang Ming Shan, to pray for my grandparents (my father’s side), where we’ve arranged to meet with my aunt.  Than we lay out all the offerings &amp; things for praying. My father, my cousin &amp; me went to ‘invite’ &amp; ‘bring’ our grandparents to the offering table to ‘enjoy’ the offerings.  During the invitation, we feel that my grandfather’s urn look very dirty.  There was this uncle who was in the columbium.  So we’ve decided to ask him to help clean the urn.  In rtn, we’ve given him a small amt of money in a red packet.  After leaving Guang Ming Shan, we left for Tong Teck Shan Tong where we’d be praying my grandfather (my mother’s side).  Than we left the place for home.  Finally, after a tiring day, I can go home &amp; rest.
<br />However, during normal days @ home, I do missed my grandfather (my father’s father) sometimes.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> I’d think of the times he’d fetch me to &amp; fro fr school starting fr PAP to pri school.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> He’d bring me to the market every morning to drink soya milk.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> He loved me so much and I missed him so much.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> But I never had a chance to say ‘AH GONG I  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> LOVE  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" /> U’ &amp; top up with  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" /> a kiss on the chick.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Praying for Qing Ming @ Home</span>
<br />Today I woke up early again.  Cos I need to go to the mkt to get the things needed for the praying later @ home.  My mother &amp; I 1st went to buy a duck, some roasted pork, a pkt of yellow dao kua, a fish cake &amp; some veg.  Than we went to catch out breakfast.  After that, it’s bz time.  We went home to make a pot of tea, a pot of soup &amp; laid the table for praying.  After praying, we had our lunch. Took a short rest.  Than went to YCKCC for our next activity.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Went to SCDF’s CD shelter open House @ Lorong Chuan</span>
<br />What a fruitful trip!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> I’ve learnt so much today.  What to do in a CD shelter.  I’ve always heard of ppl saying what to do what to do in a CD shelter.  But I’ve never been to a CD shelter b4.  So I can’t really imagine that.  However, now that I’ve been to  CD shelter, I know what I should do in a CD shelter.  1st of all we must try to STAY CALM.  2ND, move to a public CD SHELTER (if u do not hv 1 @ home).  3rd, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS when u r in the shelter.  Only come out of the shelter when it’s safe.  Not only that, I’ve also learnt what the SCDF personnels will do sh there b a chemical attack, what r the facilities in the CD shelter &amp; etc.  in a nutshell, I’ve learnt tones today.  <strong>READINESS IS YOUR ONLY PROTECTION</strong>
