<br />it seems just yesterday fades away in to time 
<br />I've lost so many only if i had a dime
<br />it's my trust that hurts me more then my pride
<br />It's my love i see when in the mirror I'm took'n for a ride
<br />i search the heavens for a place to rest
<br />but when i open my eyes i see countless poems upon my deist
<br />I've faced the pain directly in the eyes
<br />but no one cares and i still hear everyone of there cries
<br />there was a struggle that i could not get pass 
<br />i found that it was me i was living life to fast
<br />through these words i ask for you to believe
<br />believe in me for i see truth and not deceive
<br />i search my heart for the room i hind
<br />but i seem not to be able to find that one and only to be be my side
<br />some how it seems our names are upon a list 
<br />but i asked why and he replied tomorrow was never promised[/b]</span><strong></strong><em></em>

<br />my mind wonders as the room flicker's from a dieing light bub
<br />i wonder in my mind if there's a place to rest
<br />somewhere more com and away from all the stress
<br />I'm set out to be the best at what i do
<br />I'm using some thing called all the things I've been through
<br />i can it mit that i wish i had someone lying right here by my side
<br />but that question is already answered all my true friends have died
<br />so I'm left in imprisoned by my own soul
<br />searching for freedom and some sort of point of goal
<br />i take a glace at the star's and remember to fight
<br />i wonder in the back of my mind is a man truly defined by sight?
<br />the room fills with silence as i hear my heart beat
<br />i guess i'm just wondering when me and the man will finally meet
<br />i'm still praying for my mother to stop drink'n
<br />because all this stress <strong></strong><em></em><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>some how  just has me think'n

<br />all the good times I've have had when by so fast
<br />look in to my eyes and prove that you truly know me
<br />prove it because i haven't meant any that can truly see
<br />some how I've<strong></strong><em></em><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span> lost sight of the path i was on
<br />my life is good but the last of the true are all gone
<br />the rivers in my eyes seems like they will never stop
<br />the pain in this world won't end until we all drop
<br />when i stand in the mirror i see things clear
<br />but when i turn away i see everyone in fear
<br />is there an end to this river of pain?
<br />i guess not because i still feel the rain
<br />this world has filled the minds of many with lies
<br />but this can all be seen deeply in bedded in my brown eyes

<br />you amaze me with all your soft curves

<br />Well I guess the reason is because the true are all gone
<br />Look me in thy eyes for the fight is deeply embedded 
<br />I speak but the condemned just won’t get it 
<br />Is it that life is to hard for most to fight
<br />I can’t understand why the strong won’t do what’s right
<br />It rains because everyone is in sorrow
<br />Does everyone have any love that I can borrow?
<br />I’m under pressure can anyone help relieve?
<br />Just answer this why can’t we be free
<br />The picture is in a dieing rose
<br />I wonder and take time while wind the blows
<br />Why… why give up why now?
<br />I can’t understand this tragedy I’m tired of watching them fall to the ground
<br />And no I don’t believe in luck
<br />I’m just wondering why do we choose to give up?<strong></strong><em></em><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>

<br />I cry for those who understand the meaning of fight
<br />I search the skies because I have no other way
<br />But what about the kids that cry for another day
<br />Does any body feel the pain they feel?
<br />Does anyone know what it feels like to be killed
<br />My lights flicker, my waters turned off, my tears are falling
<br />My life is troubled my feet hurt from the walk and I still here them calling
<br />The stars fall one by one when there is no place to run
<br />The skies provide no light without the morning sun
<br />A lonely child cries for food but his cries go unheard
<br />I guess it’s so common it’s seeing another dead bird
<br />The soul is crushed at the sight of death
<br />Does anyone hear them call from there last breathe?
<br />So I guess that means no one hears there cries
<br />So be it then they most continue to walk the skies<strong></strong><em></em><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>

<br />Maybe a man truly isn’t defined by sight
<br />My life has been a struggle to survive
<br />But no one understands how I truly feel in side
<br />I’m young yes I know
<br />But if you think I don’t have an older mind than let that be so
<br />But than again you maybe right maybe I can’t see
<br />It’s possible a young mind and an old soul could never be
<br />People see a side I do not show
<br />So how is it possible that they can say they know
<br />Besides that I know I have true sight
<br />Even though it’s possible you could be right
<br />I’ve walked many miles just to prove who I could be
<br />But people question and ask how could this be
<br />I know my life and I know I have sight

<br />I just want you to remember that I continued to fight
<br />the stars have cried but no one could hear
<br />I see my self dieing alone with no body there
<br />Shot to the heart will I ever walk again
<br />When I die will I have found that one and only friend?
<br />The lord can’t hear me cry for I know only I will be there when I die
<br />No one cares…… for my family will not cry
<br />The lies have blinded the people I care for the most
<br />I guess my walk has been long but now I must continue to walk the coast
<br />Shed tears for I see that only the true at heart are the only to care
<br />The pain the rain and the dark are the only ones near
<br />When I die I shall be free I shall be loved I shall be me
<br />I’ve fort to make it but still my voice isn’t load enough for them to see
<br />This  is true my family will not cry
<br />This is why I continue to whisper shall I die shall I die shall I die….<strong></strong><em></em><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>

<br />It’s crazy my future was so close I could have turn the page
<br />They don’t understand because they were never there
<br />I understood that but I see no one even cares

<br />Nightmares of my grandmother death slowly drive me insane 
<br />A troubled soul winders through the night in search of freedom

<br />Strength has been encrypted unto my soul
<br />I find my self searching for more without the anger of unrewarded goal
<br />As the star’s slowly plummet from the shy I watch from my window as my eyes fall a sleep

<br />But the fight continues as the devils friends laugh
<br />My judgment has been wasted upon the streets of my block
<br />I must pick up the peaces as the silence surrounds the clock
<br />I guess when I look back on everything it’s sad how many have been lost
<br />People take lives without the second thought of cost
<br />So there the skies rain pain the cause of living is gone
<br />People rage war with them selves and before night came dawn
<br />I Open my eyes to realize that all is lost and peace is broken
<br />I tell these words to many but the lost think that I’m joken
<br />So the prize is lost forever forgotten broken and kicked to the side
<br />Our youth are troubled and left lost without an older guide
<br />But trust in the true because there are more things out here
<br />There are place’s of joy we must experience but the question is do we won’t to be there?
<br />People are surprised at the sight of the dead
<br />But why be when all this was once said

<br />But half of that time I wondered if the fighting would ever cease
<br />But as I took a walk I found hate in an unlikely place
<br />It was in the heart and I found my self looking it directly in the face
<br />So I planned for a long night hoping to get past the fight
<br />But it came to fast and I became surrounded in fright 
<br />If there was a place I could rest 
<br />I believe love would be the number one test
<br />But hope Is far and destruction is near
<br />But like a thief in the night no one will care
<br />So to my knees I must fall
<br />I must search for more because this can’t be all
<br />I paste back and forth just to find there is no hope
<br />My life is cold and the affect is hard to coop
<br />So there I have no place in my heart left to run
<br />But I can’t give up not today nor tomorrow
