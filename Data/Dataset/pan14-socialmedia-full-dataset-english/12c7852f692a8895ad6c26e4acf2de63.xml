<br /><br />she ended up staying longer than
<br /><br />planned,
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br /><br />afraid
<br /><br />because it was a small town and she lived
<br /><br />only
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br /><br />trees,
<br /><br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br /><br />harm
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br /><br />short
<br /><br />cut to her house, she decided to take it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br /><br />noticed
<br /><br />a
<br /><br />man standing at the end as though he
<br /><br />were
<br /><br />waiting
<br /><br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br /><br />asking
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br /><br />though
<br /><br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br /><br />home
<br /><br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br /><br />newspaper
<br /><br />that
<br /><br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br /><br />alley
<br /><br />just
<br /><br />twenty minutes after she had been there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />fact
<br /><br />that it could have been her, she began to
<br /><br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br /><br />help
<br /><br />this
<br /><br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br /><br />police
<br /><br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man, so
<br /><br />she
<br /><br />told
<br /><br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br /><br />willing to
<br /><br />look
<br /><br />at a lineup to see if she could identify
<br /><br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br /><br />the
<br /><br />man
<br /><br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br /><br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br /><br />identified,
<br /><br />he
<br /><br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her bravery
<br /><br />and
<br /><br />asked if there was anything they could do
<br /><br />for
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br /><br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br /><br />attacked
<br /><br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br /><br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br /><br />She
<br /><br />had
<br /><br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br /><br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br /><br />you're
<br /><br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br /><br />teenagers
<br /><br />will not stand up for God?
<br /><br />Repost this as A GIRL RAPED IN (your city) if you truly
<br /><br />believe
<br /><br />in
<br /><br />God..,
<br /><br />PS: God is always there in your heart and loves you no matter what
<br /><br />&quot;If you deny me in front of your friends, I shall deny you in front of my Father&quot;
<br /><br />STAND UP FOR HIM
<br /><br />93% wont repost this
