Whilst hunting by way of my notes from purchaser meetings and tradeshows, I observed one particular circled and starred between the scribble:<br /><br />&quot;10 Ideas for Raising Technology and Operational Performance: Very best Practices from the CUNA Engineering Council&quot;<br /><br />#1 suggestion: Boost efficiencies by implementing electronic workflow<br /><br />This was an enlightening moment for me. In the prior, credit unions have focused so a lot time and work on generating content material digital that they merely haven't had the time for the course of action element of it. But, a few many years back, they swiftly discovered that in buy to meet their members' requires and remain afloat, they want to re-assess processes and come across a lot more successful ways to get perform done. This session obviously reflected this notion.<br /><br />But that range one particular suggestion - Boost efficiencies by applying digital workflow - was just that - a single suggestion. To give a bit a lot more meat to it, and to kick off the new calendar year right for credit unions' procedure automation, here are 3 predicaments where credit unions can advantage from workflow:<br /><br />1. Bank loan operations departments - &quot;Compensated Off&quot; report<br /><br />If you have at any time worked in the bank loan functions office, you know that this Paid out Off report will come each day. The crew then need to decide if overpayment refunds are required or collateral requirements to be launched or returned. Then, they ought to also initiate document retention durations for the mortgage files. Using a workflow and other <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hyland.com%2Findustry-solutions%2Ffinancial-services%2Fcredit-unions.aspx"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyland.com/industry-solutions/financial-services/credit-unions.aspx</a> to discover these triggers and then instantly flowing the relevant document(s) or information by means of a lifecycle of pre-configured operate queues is the place the power of workflow actually shines.<br /><br />two. Mortgage loan origination procedure<br /><br />Here's a good instance of a procedure that includes plenty of diverse techniques. The mortgage loan loan origination program (LOS) has an inner workflow that collects info in the application stage of the procedure. In the long run, it locations loan requests into a status or queue for the underwriters to make their choices.<br /><br />When underwriters retrieve loans from the queue, they have entry to all of the facts that the originators entered. In most instances, they also receive paper loan files with the supporting paperwork. This is wherever credit union software program like information management and workflow can play a part. By letting the LOS do what it does finest (handling data and transactional workflow) and integrating the documents and data in the ECM program to the LOS, consumers are equipped to remain in the organization software they are most relaxed with. In the end, you gain efficiencies like greater productivity and happier workers.<br /><br />three. Sustaining a house loan bank loan<br /><br />The LOS is created to be transactional so the photographs are tied to that one home loan transaction. But, that frequently brings about the documents to be held hostage in that technique. By heading the images into the ECM archive and enabling workflow, documents can be shared with other apps - and more importantly, other departments - that could not have access to the LOS. In addition, the LOS does not have document retention abilities, so when the mortgage is paid out off there is no way to begin a retention interval and delete the document image when the retention period expires.<br /><br />The day has arrive: Credit unions have had the large &quot;aha&quot; second: Even the greatest core programs are unable to get rid of paper and the expenses and sluggish processes that go alongside with it. Now, it is time to put these strategies in to practice and just take advantage of workflow and other credit union software package.<br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.articlemom.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhome-based-business%2Fmind-your-queue-by-using-electronic-queue-system%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlemom.com/business/home-based-business/mind-your-queue-by-using-electronic-queue-system/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.articlesubmited.com%2F2011%2F11%2F11%2Fmind-your-queue-by-making-use-of-electronic-queue-system-2%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.articlesubmited.com/2011/11/11/mind-your-queue-by-making-use-of-electronic-queue-system-2/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ezeearticles.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhome-based-business%2Fmind-your-queue-by-making-use-of-electronic-queue-system%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezeearticles.com/business/home-based-business/mind-your-queue-by-making-use-of-electronic-queue-system/</a>
