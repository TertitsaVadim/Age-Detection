<br /><br />Memory chip maker Micron Technology (NAS: MU) recently came out with fiscal third-quarter losses that were much wider than what analysts had expected. However, what's proved to be even more disappointing is the fact that Micron has made its biggest yet, fourth consecutive quarterly loss.
<br />So what seems to be the real problem with Micron? Before we delve into the details, let's take a closer look at the numbers.
<br /><br />The numbers
<br />Micron's revenue increased 8% on a sequential basis, although it remained relatively flat from the prior-year period. This was mainly because of a 20% sequential increase in revenue in the DRAM segment -- the result of a combination of higher sales volumes and average selling prices.
<br />Unfortunately, on the other hand, Micron incurred a loss amounting to $320 million, as part of a series of quarterly losses mainly caused by the prevailing softness in the flash memory market. Revenue from the company's NAND segment remained largely flat, despite a whopping 40% increase in sales volumes, mainly because of weak market prices.
<br />However, one can take heart from the fact that these problems are not specific to Micron, as its peers in the NAND industry have also been having a hard time of late. For instance, flash memory king SanDisk's (NAS: SNDK) net income declined almost 50% as compared to the prior-year period because of weak market prices.
<br /><br />The bright side
<br />Micron has a few other reasons to feel happy as well. Demand in the DRAM space is beginning to show some signs of bottoming out. Plus, a further boost in the DRAM segment should occur when Microsoft releases its newest Windows 8 operating system, which in turn, should stimulate demand from Micron's OEM customers, namely Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
<br />Micron is also in the process of taking over the bankrupt Japanese DRAM manufacturer Elpida Memory. If the company is successful, this would double Micron's market share in the DRAM space and should somewhat reduce competition as well. Nevertheless, the positive effect of this development remains to be seen.
<br /><br />The flip side 
<br />But the company has its share of concerns, too. The NOR flash space is witnessing tough times. According to a TechNavio analyst forecast, the global NOR flash market will decline at a CAGR of -5% from 2011 through 2014 mainly because of a decline in average selling prices. However, the increasing demand for NOR chips could be a long-term positive in this direction.
<br />The NAND flash space is also passing through a turbulent phase, and Micron could see this segment of its business take a hit in the coming months. This is because NAND flash memory chips, used in mobile devices and solid-state drives, or SSDs, have been facing weak demand, coupled with oversupply issues of late.
<br /><br />The Foolish bottom line
<br />Micron is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of just 0.7, which at first makes it seem attractive. However, I'd prefer to watch from the sidelines until Micron starts putting some cash on the table. The company's acquisition of Elpida could work in its favor in the long run, provided there is a significant improvement in the DRAM space.

<br /><br />A study released in Micron Associates highlighted nicotine replacement therapy is the safest way for people discharged from the hospital after suffering a heart attack or chest pains.
<br />This is good news for a group of patients whose need to quit smoking.
<br />“We know continued smoking after a heart attack greatly increases the risk of a recurrent heart attack, (but) the ability of patients to quit smoking cold turkey is pretty low in general,” said Dr. Kevin Woolf, a cardiologist at Hillsboro Cardiology in Oregon, who led the study.
<br />Anti-smoking medications, such as the nicotine patch, gum, inhalers and lozenges, can double the chances that would-be quitters will actually kick the habit, said Woolf.
<br />But, he added, there has been a theoretical concern that nicotine replacement might come with its own hazards for heart patients.
<br />“We know that nicotine causes constriction of the arteries, which on paper could potentially harm patients with arteries in the heart that were already somewhat blocked,” Woolf told Micron Associates.
<br />To see whether nicotine replacement therapies do cause harm, Woolf and his colleagues collected medical information on 663 smokers discharged from the hospital after having acute coronary syndrome – which includes a heart attack or feeling chest pain without exercising, a condition called unstable angina.
<br />Doctors prescribed a nicotine replacement product, in most cases the patch, to 184 of the patients.
<br />After one year, the patients who received a prescription fared about as well as those who didn’t.
<br />Woolf and his colleagues report in the American Journal of Cardiology that 29 percent of the people in the nicotine group and 31 percent of the people in the other group died or experienced another major heart problem within a year of leaving the hospital.
<br />“This study adds support to safely using this medication after an acute coronary syndrome,” Woolf said.
<br />Dr. Stephen Kimmel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said the study backs up many cardiologists who had already considered nicotine replacement safe.
<br />“If you’ve just had a heart attack or another heart event you should talk to your doctor and ask them about this therapy. Make sure you raise the issue if your doctor doesn’t, because it can help you and it seems safe,” said Kimmel, who was not involved in the study.
<br />Woolf said having an anti-smoking aid available to smokers’ right out of the hospital is important “because it’s a golden opportunity to assist them.”
<br />“When somebody comes into the hospital with a heart attack, it’s a wake-up call for them,” Woolf said, and they might be more willing to change their habits than later on.
<br />The study didn’t find out whether patients prescribed nicotine replacement therapy actually used it, nor whether those who were not prescribed it might have gotten their own over-the-counter nicotine replacement products.
<br />“But we can get a sense of things,” said Woolf. “Averaged over a large population, we should be able to tease out any trends that emerge from getting a prescription.”
<br />Woolf said an experiment that tracks the health of people who use nicotine replacement products, compared to the health of those who don’t, would be the best measure of the medicines’ safety.

The biennial meetings followed clashes between Hollande and Merkel at the European Summit of June 28-29, where German Chancellor faced pressure from France, Italy and Spain may be more burden for the currency zone debt.
<br />&quot;At every step of European integration, the German-French friendship was the base,&quot; Hollande said outside Reims cathedral yesterday as he stood next to Merkel under rainy skies. &quot;I suggest to you that we have a new door to open even tighter friendship.&quot;

<br />Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds fell to a three-week low of 6.17 percent after the summit, rising for three consecutive days until the end of last week at 6.87 percent. The dollar rallied to $ 1.2291 per euro in New York on 6 July, its biggest jump against the common currency since the five days ending 9 September.
<br />&quot;The European Union's economic and currency, established twenty years ago, has proved not strong enough yet,&quot; Merkel said at yesterday's ceremony. &quot;Our generation has the right to learn from that.&quot;

<br /><br />WASHINGTON-Internet providers have plans to help their customers Monday and others are stiffened because thousands of calls to helplines around the country whose computers are infected with malicious software over a year ago faced the possibility of not being able to get online.
<br />Internet users scan their Twitter feeds or Facebook accounts Sunday were encouraged to add a faster Click to check their computer for malware.
<br />Some providers can put technical solutions in place that the server problem that some computers could become after midnight Sunday will correct. They do it, the Internet will work, but the malware continues on victims computers and future problems, could provide DeGrasso said Tom, an FBI supervisory special agent.
<br />Micron Associates said that the FBI planned closure of the web servers set up as a temporary safety net to keep infected computers online for the past eight months. The Agency obtained the injunction to keep the servers running smoothly, and was not renewed.
<br />The problem began when international hackers ran a scam online advertising for feeding control of more than 570,000 infected computers around the world. When the FBI went too take of the hackers late last year, realized agents that if they the malignant servers that be used to check the computers disabled, all victims their Internet service lose would.
<br />In a highly unusual move, the FBI set up the safety net. The agency brought in a private company two clean Internet servers to take over for the malicious servers so that people do not suddenly lose their Internet would be installed.
<br />The FBI arranged for a private company to run a website - <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dcwg.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcwg.org</a> - as a place where computer users can go and see if their computer watertje septic and find links to other computer security business sites where they could find solutions to the problem.
<br />From the beginning, most victims did not even know that their computers were infected, although malicious software probably has delayed their web browsing and off their antivirus software, making their machines vulnerable to other problems.
<br />Many computer users do not understand the complex machines they use every day to e-mail, shopping, and cruise information. The cyber world of viruses, malware, bank fraud and Internet scams is often distant and confusing, and warning messages can go unnoticed or ignored.
<br />Also, some people just do not trust the government, and believe that only the federal government are trying to spy on them or via the Internet to take. Blogs and other internet forums are riddled with bookings warning from the Government using the malware as a trick to infringement on American citizens computers. This is a free FBI and other cyber security experts who are familiar with the malware quickly condemn as ludicrous.
<br />The Internet is still, inundated with conspiracy theories.
<br />There is an underlying feeling that this is much ado about nothing, as the approach of 2000 will be. The transition to the year presented technical problems and fears that some computers would stop working because they were not set for the date change. Ultimately, there were very few problems.
<br />Given the millions of Internet users across the country, several thousand is no big deal unless you're one of them.
<br />Rep. Jim Langevin, DR.I., and co-founder of the Congressional caucus cybersecurity, said computer users have a responsibility to exercise prudent and make sure their computers are not infected or is hijacked by criminals.
<br />FBI officials have been tracking the number of computers they still believe may be infected by the malware. As of Wednesday, there were approximately 45,600 in the U.S. - nearly 20,000 less than a week ago. The total is about 250,000 infected worldwide. The songs are fallen steadily, and recent efforts by Internet-providers can restrict the problems on Mondays.

<br /><br />Thomas and Raymond Kwok, the billionaire co-chairmen of Asia's largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties, and Rafael Hui, Hong Kong's former No.2 public official, appeared at a Hong Kong court today to hear formal corruption charges against them.
<br />This is Hong Kong’s biggest corruption case in 40 years. The charges come after investigations between government officials and the city’s tycoons. That has touched a nerve with angry citizens who are concerned at the wide spread corruption between a  leading public figure and the two billionaire property developers.
<br />After attending the one hour hearing where they were both formally charged, the youngest brother Raymond Kwok talked to a waiting press corp, saying in Cantonese, that he had done nothing wrong
<br />&quot;I firmly believe I haven't done anything wrong. The Hong Kong judicial system is very fair. I will do my best to defend myself against these accusations. My goal is to prove my innocence. Thank you.&quot;
<br />Three others have also been charged in the Sun Hung Kai case. Thomas Chan, the Sun Hung Kai board member in charge of land purchases, Francis Kwan, a former banker and a former chief operation officer of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange. Thomas Kwok's lawyer declined to comment while lawyers representing the other four could not immediately be reached for comment.

<br /><br />HONG KONG — Tens of thousands including teachers and parents pushing strollers took to Hong Kong streets Sunday to protest the upcoming introduction of Chinese patriotism classes they fear will lead to brainwashing, the latest sign of growing discomfort over Beijing's influence in the semiautonomous territory.
<br />Students and pro-democracy activists were among those who marched to the Hong Kong government's headquarters to protest the new curriculum, which authorities are encouraging schools to begin using when classes resume in September.
<br />They fear the classes will be used to brainwash children into supporting China's Communist Party. The government has denied that and says they are aimed at building Chinese national pride.
<br />The controversy flared up after reports emerged that pro-Beijing groups published a booklet for use in classes that extolled the virtues of one-party rule.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;China wants Hong Kong's next generation to know how great it is and not know the bad stuff,&amp;amp;quot; said Chan Yip-Long, a 9-year-old primary school student. &amp;amp;quot;The booklet is very biased, so I am opposing it.&amp;amp;quot;
<br />The protest is the latest sign of growing discontent in Hong Kong over mainland China's increasing influence 15 years after the freewheeling financial center was returned to China by Britain following more than a century of colonial rule. Tensions have also been stoked by growing economic inequality and as well as an influx of free-spending wealthy Chinese, who are seen as driving up property prices and shop rents.
<br />Hong Kongers are also angry about stunted democratic development. Beijing has pledged that Hong Kong can elect its own leader in 2017 and all legislators by 2020, though no roadmap has been laid out. On July 1, tens of thousands of people protested over the city's new leader, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who was chosen by an elite pro-Beijing committee and is widely suspected of having close ties to the Communist Party.
<br />Sunday's demonstrators carried placards and banners and shouted slogans calling for the government to withdraw its plan to introduce the Moral and National Education curriculum.
<br />The government has stood firm and plans to make the subject compulsory in primary schools starting in 2015 and in secondary schools the year after, although schools are encouraged to start using it earlier.
<br />According to the curriculum guidelines, students will learn about China's political leaders, the efforts and contributions they have made and the difficulties and challenges they face, as well as how to &amp;amp;quot;speak cautiously,&amp;amp;quot; practice self-discipline and get along well with others in a rational and respectful manner.
<br />Police estimated 32,000 people turned out for Sunday's protest. Despite blazing heat, many parents were there, pushing infants and young children in strollers. A group of young girls chanted, &amp;amp;quot;We want the truth, we don't want brainwashing.&amp;amp;quot;

<br /><br />According to the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Fathers who are preferred to have children until they’re almost at the age of 40 may provide their offspring a longer life. The children will inherit the longer telomeres, caps at the end of the chromosomes which then protects them from the so-called degeneration. The longer telomeres provide slower aging and may mean a longer lifespan. However, based from the research the older a man reproduces child is likely to produce disorders like autism. Moreover, older fathers have a chance to lower intelligence scores than those born to younger men.
<br />A study author and doctoral student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois- Dan Eisenberg. He said that most of literature also suggests risks from paternal age .The longer telomerse may delay sexual development, and direct the body’s energy into maintaining itself and staying healthy, he added. In addition, the late fatherhood may serve as a signal that mortality rates are low.The benefit was also seen in grandchildren of men who became fathers at later ages.
<br />The correlation held regardless of whether the families were rich or poor, the study said.
<br />A report released in Micron Associates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American men have their first child at the age of 25.
<br />Damaged telomeres cause cells to stop dividing, stem cells become dormant, organs to atrophy and brain cells to die. As most cells age, the telomeres become shorter and shorter. This isn’t the case for sperm, where the telomeres lengthen with age. The men may be passing the longest telomeres to their children, the longest lifespan.

<br /><br />Over the years Capital Campaigns have evolved from mammoth campaigns with hundreds of volunteers and staff to today when campaigns are much smaller both in structure and length of time and are highly volunteer oriented.
<br /><br />Few Capital Campaigns for other than major institutions take more than 12 to 18 months to complete and are more recently designed to be conducted by development staff with the assistance of a consultant. In organizations that have no development department staff, they usually opt to have on-site campaign direction, that is, an on-site Campaign Director/Consultant who works 24/7 on their project.
<br />We at Bradley Associates are proud to provide staffing whether you need it for a couple days a month or full-time on-site Director. We are in position to provide that staff to help achieve your goals in the shortest possible time line.
<br /><br />The ultimate success of a Capital Campaign for significant funding support of specific programs or projects always goes back to the essential &quot;pre-campaign&quot; tasks that either were or were not accomplished prior to the start of the campaign. A stalled Capital Campaign is most likely the result of insufficient preparation. No Capital Campaign preparation step is more important than the Capital Campaign Planning Study (or Feasibility Study).
<br /><br />Here are our thoughts regarding the all-important Capital Campaign Planning Study:
<br />It can be argued that a Study is the single most important planning step for a successful capital campaign.
<br />A Study offers the unique opportunity for an &quot;outside set of eyes and ears&quot; to ask important questions of potential campaign leaders and potential donors, and to receive candid and accurate answers from them regarding critical campaign feasibility issues.
<br />It does matter who the outside consultant and Study Director is. The professionalism of this individual reflects back to the client. Bradley Associates assigns its best staff for Study Director Positions and values the client image in the community to the highest degree.
<br />A client should expect the following &quot;deliverables&quot; from a Study:
<br />A complete written and thorough study report
<br />A professional presentation to client leadership groups
<br />Confidential executive and management reports for key leadership
<br />Comprehensive recommendations that address all angles of funding feasibility
<br />Recommendations for goals, leadership, campaign structure and timing
<br />We would be happy to provide a 10 page self analysis to determine your readiness to begin a Capital Campaign. Request a copy.
<br /><br />We are prepared to help you and will provide consulting services as needed.
