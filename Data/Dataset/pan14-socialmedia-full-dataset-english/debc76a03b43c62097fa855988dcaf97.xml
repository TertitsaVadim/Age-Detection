<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call.
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure.
<br /><br />She walks into the next room.
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up?
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early.
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great!
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now.
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea...
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not?
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...?
<br /><br />In her head she yells, SHIT! Throws clothes back on quickly.
<br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort?
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his bestfriend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head.
<br /><br />Guy: What the hell is going on?!
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me!
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!!
<br /><br />Girl: John...!
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door.
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street.
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling...
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries.
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears.
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?!
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap.
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring.
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose?
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair.
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he just jumped off the bridge and killed himself.
<br /><br />If you love/like someone, and you want them in your life forever. Repost in 380 seconds as &quot;cheating hurts.&quot; Or your true love will walk away

<br />As he sat down, he noticed a white man tlkin bout him behind him.
<br />The black man turned around and stood up. He then said:
<br />&quot;When I was born I was black,&quot;
<br />&quot;When I grew up I was black,&quot;
<br />&quot;When I'm sick I'm black,&quot;
<br />&quot;When I go in the sun I'm black,&quot;
<br />&quot;When I'm cold I'm black,&quot;
<br />&quot;When I die I'll be black.&quot;
<br />&quot;But you sir...&quot;
<br />&quot;When you're born you're pink,&quot;
<br />&quot;When you're sick, you're green,&quot;
<br />&quot;When you go in the sun you turn red,&quot;
<br />&quot;When you're cold you turn blue,&quot;
<br />&quot;And when you die you turn purple.&quot;
<br />&quot;And you have the nerve to call me coloured&quot;
<br />The black man then sat back down and the white man walked away...
<br />Copy this onto your space and help erase racism!!!!!!!!!

<br /><br />-- When you chew gum before you kiss, it actually makes your breath SMELL WORSE than before because of your salivary glands...
<br /><br />// Mints work MUCH better. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
<br /><br />`*GUYS; It is much more ROMANTiC to kiss girls in a fancy restaurant or UNDER THE STARS than to kiss in your disgusting bedroom or in the movie theaters
<br /><br />`*GiRLS; Just because a guy kisses you every 10 minutes doesn't mean he’s using you ...he's just a little horny &amp;&amp; there`s no problem with that !!!
<br /><br />-- It has been PR0VEN that when people with the SAME Hair C0L0R kiss, it is more R0MANTiC than that of a different hair color!!!
<br /><br />[(WE D0NT KNOW WHY)]
<br /><br />-- your First Kiss isn’t always your BEST Kiss
<br /><br />-- If you can tie a KN0T in a CHERRY with your tongue, it doesn't mean you are a good kisser .. it just means your TOUNGE MUSCLE is strong
<br /><br />-- ALL GiRLS are NOT hoes, and ALL GUYS are NOT PLAYERS .. EVERYONE gets a LiTTLE H0RNY sometimes
<br /><br />BE A GREAT KiSSER W/ THESE TiPS
<br /><br />-- T0UCH HiS/HER FACE
<br /><br />-- RUN Y0UR FiNGERS THR0UGH HiS/HER HAiR
<br /><br />-- KiSS S0FTLY AT FiRST, THEN APPLY M0RE PRESSURE
<br /><br />-- H0LD Y0UR KiSSiNG PARTNER
<br /><br />Kissing Language (yup, it's a language)
<br />if a kiss is the Language of Love,
<br />then we have a lot to talk about it...
<br /><br />methods of Love....

<br /><br />and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love
<br /><br />for the first time.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
<br /><br />sex.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer,
<br /><br />with his head down.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *

<br /><br />have bad sex for life!!!

<br /><br />Here's how it works:
<br />Statistically speaking, unless you are a total hermit, social retard, or ugly as a bag of spoiled ass...
<br />There's at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you or sleep with you. So..... lets play &quot;friends with benefits&quot;
<br /><br />The rules are simple... if you want to date the person who posted this, send them a msg saying &quot;I'M YOURS&quot;
<br /><br />If you just want to sleep with them and stay friends, send them a message that says &quot;I'D HIT IT&quot;
<br /><br />THE TWIST IS YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN
<br />&amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you, and maybe more that want to sleep with you.

<br />It makes us feel SO secure to know that our girlfriends aren't off flirting with guys we've never heard of.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />Also, don't talk about your ex-boyfriends.
<br />We never have, nor ever will respect or like them, nor do we want to hear about them.
<br /><br />When you do, you're asking your boyfriend to be jealous.
<br /><br />You're asking your boyfriend to lose trust.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />On that, don't hump everything that walks into the room.
<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/ cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.

<br />Yeah, you can quote me.

<br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open.
<br />Smile and say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Let us pay for you.
<br /><br />Don't &quot;feel bad.&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and say - everybody together now - &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br />__________________________________

<br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know nobody's looking we'll be more impressed.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have, put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for WHO you are and not WHAT you are.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />DONT flirt with guys when we're not around.
<br /><br />We'll find out. Trust us.
<br />We have eyes everywhere.
<br />And when we find out, we're pissed.
<br /><br />Not necessarily with the guys you flirted with, more-so with YOU.
<br />__________________________________

<br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br />__________________________________
<br />__________________
<br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hot Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, or Jesse McCartny is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care.
<br />You have girlfriends for that.

<br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;?
<br /><br />Why does everything have to be &quot;hot/sexy&quot;?
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey
<br />handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />But seriously sometimes looks ISNT everything alot guys who arent exactly &quot;hot&quot; will treat you the way you need to be treated
<br /><br />Claiming girls or guys to be &quot;hot&quot; shows immaturity.

<br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: IF YOU AREN'T BEING TREATED RIGHT BY A GUY, DON'T WAIT FOR HIM TO CHANGE. DITCH HIS SORRY, DISGRACE-TO-THE-MALE-POPULATION ASS, AND FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TREAT YOU WITH UTTER RESPECT
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the
<br />eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ...
<br /><br />....and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
