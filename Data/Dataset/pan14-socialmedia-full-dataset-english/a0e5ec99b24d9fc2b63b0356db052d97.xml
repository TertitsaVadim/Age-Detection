But sometimes we also need to give ourselves better physical support to deliver a better performance. That is why running shoes makers come up with exciting new technologies and designs to give us an edge in our performance. Similarly car tires are designed to improve the performance of the car. With better quality support the performance becomes better. So that should mean if the driver of the car has better support than the driver's performance will get better as well. And that is very true. You would have seen how much research goes into the seat for a racing car driver. And you can enjoy the benefits as well by opting for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8yNzAyL1JhY2luZy1TZWF0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">racing seats</a> for your car.
<br /><br />Racing seats are designed to give you all the freedom of motion you require while driving a high performance car. But at the same time you are not left free to sway from side to side as the car goes through tight corners. Though you have all the freedom you need you also have support from all sides so that you do not start to sway in your seat while driving. You will be able to maintain a stable posture at all times. If the posture is not stable either the drive will become risky or you will not be able to push the performance to its limits. 
<br /><br />An added benefit of racing seats is that they make your car look exciting even as it is standing still. The contours exude high tech class and invite the onlooker to hop into the drivers seat and check out the cars top performance. You can check out racing seats conveniently by going online. At the time you can check out other cool products for your car's interiors such as a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNDUvU3RlZXJpbmctV2hlZWxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">custom steering wheel</a>.

And when it has a breath taking shape then that is the icing on the cake. Even ordinary everyday products leap up and grab our attention when they are made of a material that has those properties. No wonder carbon fiber products are such a popular car aftermarket product category. They were already being used for add on products such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMDgvQ2FyX1Nwb2lsZXJzX0NhcmJvbl9GaWJlcl9TcG9pbGVycy5odG1s" target="_blank">car spoilers</a> to minimize the additional weight and now they are also making the relatively dull car trunk come alive with the help of carbon fiber trunks.
<br /><br />Carbon fiber is very light and yet it can have very high strength. This strength is directional. Which means that how much force the fiber, or the product made from it, can endure depends on the direction and nature of the force. For products where multi directional strength is required the fiber is placed in all the directions in which the strength is required. The fiber is combined with a matrix material, usually epoxy resins, to make the product. So though the products are often referred to as carbon fiber products in reality they are carbon fiber composite products.
<br /><br />The high quality products usually have a great finish and the workmanship is excellent specially when you compare it with other composite material based products. And when you will opt for a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9pbmZvLzM2L0NhcmJvbi1GaWJlci1UcnVuay1MaWRzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">carbon fiber trunk</a> made of the material your car will get a high tech aspect to its appearance. People will stop and look at the special looking car. Of course you will also enjoy the benefit of driving a lighter car because the carbon fiber trunk will be lighter than the one that came with the stock car. You will enjoy a more lively drive in a great looking car. You can double the benefits by opting for a carbon fiber hood along with the carbon fiber trunk. You can check out the products conveniently by going online. They do not cost a lot and give you great benefits.

Some are not so expensive and others cost a fortune. If you try to play a song you can play on both a cheap one and an expensive one. But the sound of the expensive one will be better and the melody of the song will shine through better when played on the expensive piano. And that is why people spend so much more to own a high quality piano. But the quality of sound is used not just to judge musical instruments, where of course it is a logical choice, but other products as well are judges by the sound they make. For example if a car is not functioning entirely properly an experienced car mechanic will be able to detect the problem by just hearing the sound of the car.
<br /><br />And the upmarket cars tend to have a distinctive sound of their own. It is usually more quiet unless the car is a sports car in which case it can have a deep roar. They do not all sound alike but they do tend to have signature sounds. Now you know you can change the looks of your car with the help of several aftermarket products, such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS85OC9FeHRlcmlvcl9Cb2R5LVN0eWxpbmdfRnVsbC1Cb2R5LUtpdHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">body kits</a>, that are out there. But how can you change the sound of your car. And even if you can change it how can you make it sound better? Well the good news is that you can change the sound of your car and also control the change so that it sounds like a high pedigree car. And the news gets even better, because as you do that the performance of your car will get better as well. 
<br /><br />So what is this product that can do this for you? Well it is a cat back exhaust. Most of the sound that your car makes is due to the expansion of the exhaust gases as they leave your car's engine and make their way out via the exhaust. A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzQvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9DYXQtQmFjay1FeGhhdXN0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">cat back exhaust</a> enables them to leave quickly and thereby reducing the back pressure. And it also controls the expansion of the exhaust gases and so it controls the sound made by your car. And the best ones give you a great sound.

But where can the vibrations go? Well for that the car has shock absorbers. These absorb the energy which would have resulted in a sharp jerk to the passengers and instead dissipate it out slowly over time so that instead of a jerk there is a mild swaying. Which is great, now the passengers will not have a bone rattling ride. Instead immediately after the bump the car will sway a little in a direction that depends on the bump and how your car hit it. And the car may also sway as it comes out of a tight turn because the suspension reacts to that as an unbalanced force as well. But a swaying car is less easy to control than a car that has more integrity and the components do not move around independently as much. And if you want better control you must find a way to reduce the swaying without undoing all that the shock absorbers do. And you can do that with the help of strut bars.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNjIvU3VzcGVuc2lvbl9TdHJ1dC1CYXJzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Strut bars</a> link up two suspension elements of the car. This reduces the amount of independence with which they can function and the car reacts more as a whole. This reduces the sway. Of course it may also make the suspension feel a bite stiffer but that really will not make the ride uncomfortable and on the balance many people prefer to have better control with the help of strut bars. 
<br /><br />As you can see strut bars are a great way to make your car more easy to control. There are other products out there such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMDgvQ2FyX1Nwb2lsZXJzX0NhcmJvbl9GaWJlcl9TcG9pbGVycy5odG1s" target="_blank">car spoilers</a> which also help improve the control of the car and you can check them out as well. Car spoilers make your car more stable at high speeds and therefore easier to control when great control is needed the most. They do that by producing a downward force that is proportional to the speed of the car.

		<document id="f805cec1fac09f7b0d5dda47780df05e" url=""><![CDATA[Brake kits - crucial for safe driving<br/><br/>Brakes are a device that stops or slows down a vehicle. Arguably they are the most important safety feature in any vehicle. The term brake is generally used for a whole braking system having a number of components.  It is very risky to move on a trip, short or long, without reassuring that all the components of the system are properly functioning. Even a slight negligence can have disastrous consequences. If you find that the brake system is not properly responding to the commands of the driver you have to take immediate corrective steps or if need be to replace them.  Fortunately brake kits are available to replace your existing system. Even otherwise you can install a good brake kit just to upgrade your existing system. Nowadays there are many very fast moving cars on the road which makes it all the more necessary to have efficiently functioning brakes. Brake kits are available for all types of vehicles.
<br /><br />When you dwell upon various safety features in a vehicle, you have to think of tail lights as well. They look pretty and fascinating but they are essentially a safety feature. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjIvVGFpbGxpZ2h0c19jbGVhcl90YWlsbGlnaHRzX2V1cm9fdGFpbGxpZ2h0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">Tail lights</a> are actually an assembly of lights mounted at the rear end of a car. They perform many functions to maintain safety on the road. First of all they alert the driver of the car following you of your presence on the road. These lights are red in color because red lights can be seen from a longer distance even if there is fog. Fortunately we have very bright sources of light like halogen lights and LED lights which are also used in tail lights to enhance their utility. There are other lights in the assembly of tail lights, yellow in color, which indicate whether you will be turning left or right. There are lights that shine when you want to stop or move in the reverse gear. All such information is very useful for safe driving.
<br /><br />You can get information on internet about various types of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xODAvQnJha2VzX0JyYWtlLUtpdHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">brake kits</a> available in the market and about attractively designed tail lights which can also function as an adornment of your vehicle.

		<document id="e8bdbbde93eaa19fe80ad1a3444f3f71" url=""><![CDATA[Cat back exhaust - for boosting the performance of an engine<br/><br/>Engine is a vital and central component of any automobile. It is the engine that provides the driving force; and every thing else is built around it. The combustion of fuel in the engine generates power that drives a vehicle. Plentiful supply of air is essential for full combustion, and at the same time it is equally important that the gases formed as a result of the combustion are readily removed. These gases are of no use and on the contrary they exert back pressure on the engine which is harmful for the combustion process. Cat back exhaust allows these gases to speedily escape while exerting much reduced back pressure. The system provides large diameter pipes to provide least resistance to the escaping gases. A catalytic converter precedes the cat back exhaust. Its function is to neutralize some very harmful components of the escaping gases before they are released in the atmosphere. There is a muffler as well which reduces the noise created by the escaping gases. A cat back exhaust significantly boosts the performance of an engine.
<br /><br />An engine generates power to move a vehicle and the braking system helps to stop it or to slow it down. Braking system is very important for safe driving. Brake rotors are one of the main components of the braking system. When the driver applies brake the brake pads press upon the brake rotor; and the friction between the two slows down and stops the wheel. After some use there may not be enough friction between the two and the brakes may not be very effective. It is therefore necessary that brake rotors are periodically checked and if need be replaced. You cannot afford any complacency in the matters concerning safety. There are drilled brake rotors and slotted brake rotors as well. Due to friction between the brake pad and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xODIvQnJha2VfUm90b3JzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">brake rotor</a> some heat is generated which reduces the efficiency of the brakes. The aforementioned brake rotors allow some heat to escape.

Now consider a car with multiple cylinders where the fuel is burnt. In a short span of time a small amount of fuel is burnt in each cylinder and though the car is more focused on using the mechanical energy that is produced, it also needs to get rid of the exhaust gases.
<br /><br />And just like a lot of people leaving a stadium all at once from each cylinder all the exhaust gases have to leave quickly. These gases then have to be gathered together before they make their way out via the catalytic converter and the exhaust pipe. Now if the way the exhaust gases leave each cylinder and are gathered together can be made more efficient then the engine will have to spend less energy pushing the gases out and more energy will be available to your car to drive itself.
<br /><br />And this is what <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzIvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9IZWFkZXJzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">exhaust headers</a> can do for you. They manage the flow and merger of the exhaust gases from various cylinders very efficiently and reduce the amount of work the car's engine has to do in pushing out the exhaust gases. This is a very elegant way to save energy since for the same amount of fuel now you get more power. Although the saving for each time that the engine has to push out the gases may seem small, since the engine does that a very large number of times every minute, the savings add up to a significant amount.
<br /><br />If you want to make your entire exhaust system you can also opt for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzQvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9DYXQtQmFjay1FeGhhdXN0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">cat back exhaust</a> which streamline the flow of the exhaust gases once they have gone past the catalytic converter. You can check out the products conveniently by going online. You can read up the details, compare prices and make a confident decision.

And that does not mean at other times we do not wish to modify our car at all. Sometimes we want to spend  only a small amount of money and without too much fuss add something special to our car. That way we can indulge in our love for doing up our car more often, instead of waiting for big budget upgrades. And yet we want to do something that is really special and catches the eye.

And even today when you consider the truly high performance cars then you will consider several Italian cars. But if one were to pause and think about why should they so dominate one could not ascribe it to performance alone. Many manufacturers from other countries have been able to make truly high performing cars. What sets the Italian ones apart is the combination of great styling with great performance. And though performance can be matched by others the styling is elusive to match. The styling of Italian cars is such that even standing still they exude technological advancement and refinement.
<br /><br />You can add a touch of Italian style to your car by opting for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8yNzQwL1ZlcnRpY2FsX0Rvb3JzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">lambo doors</a>. These are the vertical doors that you see in stand out high performance cars. They look stunning and get their name lambo from the short form of Lamborghini which made them popular. They epitomize engineering which achieves a difficult task to make life simpler for others. It requires complicated engineering to make these doors which move in a vertical direction. But once high quality engineering is in place they make getting into and out of the car easier and very stylish. Since it requires high class engineering you must take care to buy these doors made by manufacturers with a strong reputation for quality. The components have to bear greater stress and if poor quality materials are used then the door will start having problems in the not very distant future.
<br /><br />You can combine vertical doors with other style enhancements that you maybe planning say by adding <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS85OC9FeHRlcmlvcl9Cb2R5LVN0eWxpbmdfRnVsbC1Cb2R5LUtpdHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">car body kits</a>. Today high performance is more about looks than about speed because with the highway speed limits most cars in any case drive well within their top speeds. But stunning high performance looks are still a rarity and you can get them with vertical doors and other matching products. You can check out all the high style aftermarket products online and buy them easily after gathering all the details.

But it does not save you from effort entirely. So once you have a car you do not need to run or walk to another place you do have to put in effort to drive your car. Now while driving your car your legs do a lot of work managing the clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. And you hands do a lot of work controlling the steering wheel and shifting gears.
<br /><br />Now the pedals that you use with your feet are a part of the car which the car manufacturer makes sure is soft and easy to use for you so that the strain of using them over long drives is not too much. The best cars have pedals that are easy to press and the car responds to them in a very predictable manner. The controls that you have to use with your hand can be modified by you to make them better suit your driving style. You can get a custom steering wheel and a custom short shifter to improve the comfort you have while driving your car. 
<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNDUvU3RlZXJpbmctV2hlZWxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">steering wheel</a> can have a touch and feel that feel nice to grip for you. After all you have to hold on to it for a long time so its thickness and its surface are important to how much you like to hold it all this long. And if the thickness and surface texture of the steering wheel that came with the stock car can be improved upon it is a great idea to opt for a custom steering wheel.
<br /><br />Likewise a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8yNjgyL1Nob3J0LVNoaWZ0ZXJzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">short shifter</a> reduces the distance through which your hand needs to travel to change gears. This makes changing gears less tiresome. Which is a boon on long drives. You will have a more sure feel as you slip the gear from one gear to another. You will not have to struggle to find the direction in which to push the gear knob. You will love the value this low cost car accessory offers.

Coil springs or shock absorbers which are installed on vehicles provide relief in this regard to a great extent. Coil over is a device which combines both of these. Both of these are assembled in one unit so that the coil over encircles the shock absorber. Coil over thus provides both the spring action and the damping action. Coil over is basically a suspension device and in some of these there is provision for adjusting the ride height and stiffness. The coil spring has to be sufficiently long to cover the entire height of the shock absorber, which also has to be long enough to be effective. However, a long spring has certain technological drawbacks, and therefore instead of employing one long spring two or sometimes more than two shorter springs are used. These are stacked one on top of the other. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNjEvRnVsbF9Db2lsb3Zlcl9TeXRlbXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Coilovers</a> have become quite popular, but it has to be ensured that they are correctly installed.

They can be installed in all types of vehicles whether it is a car, SUV, or a truck. That improves the vehicle’s handling in a striking way. They also reduce the body roll and provide more stability to the vehicle. Lowering springs are of great help while cornering or taking sharp turns. They can be used to bring the stance of the car nearer to the ground which improves its looks. 
<br /><br />Coil springs as well as lowering springs remarkably improve the overall performance of a vehicle. Sometimes lowering springs are used in the front end of a car and coilovers at the rear end to give a distinctive look to a car. Different types of coilovers and lowering springs are available in the market. You can look for them in automobile ancillary stores or on internet. You can get useful information about them on a number of websites. You can know there their comparative prices and also know if some discounts are available and select the best deal.

In daytime if there is bright sunshine one can easily move on without using artificial lights. At night or if the sky is overcast the driver has to use headlights to see on the road ahead of him. But if there is thick fog, or heavy rain, or snow, headlights would not suffice. Fog lights are used under such conditions. They are mounted on a car, or truck, or any other vehicle below the headlights. Their beam is directed at a level lower than the low beam headlights and they do not blind the driver coming from the opposite side. They are bright and yellow in color. Halogen lights and LED lights are also used in fog lights as they are much brighter. Nowadays HID (High Intensity Discharge) lights are also used. Some of these lights are purplish in color. Use of fog lights is essential for safe driving when weather is bad.
<br /><br />Just above the fog lights and headlights you can see <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMTYvRXh0ZXJpb3JfQm9keS1TdHlsaW5nX0dyaWxsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">billet grille</a> of a vehicle. They are so prominently placed in front that you cannot miss noticing them. Their high visibility prompts their designers to create innovative designs of billet grilles. If you properly choose them you can give a distinctive and attractive look to your vehicle. Billet grilles are usually made of aluminum, or stainless steel, or ABS plastic. Aluminum grilles are light but strong and durable. Stainless steel grilles are the strongest of all. ABS plastic grilles are comparatively not so strong but are durable and sufficiently strong. They are cheaper than other grilles. There are Bolt Over Grilles and Replacement Grilles. The former can be mounted over the existing grille while the latter can be installed only after removing the existing grille.

They are no longer a simple pair of two lamps at the front end of the vehicle as they used to be at one time. Changes have come up because the conditions demanded them and also because there had been some technological developments which were adapted for headlights. The cars now move much faster then they did in the earlier years. The driver gets much less time to react if he sees any hazard on the road. He, therefore, needs a longer stretch of road to be illuminated in front of him. Fortunately there are brighter sources of lights now like halogen lights, LED lights, or HID (High Intensity Discharge) lights which are also used in headlights. It is not enough that the light is bright; it should illuminate right areas on the road. For this purpose there are reflectors and lenses in the headlight assembly which can be manipulated by the driver to cast the beam of light in the right direction. It has also to be ensured that the headlights do not blind the driver of the vehicle coming from the opposite side. For this purpose headlights are properly located and dimmers are used. The whole assembly of headlights is packed inside a case called ‘housing’. Housings are made in attractive designs in a variety of colors to also serve as an item of adornment. 
<br /><br />No doubt, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjEvRXh0ZXJpb3JfTGlnaHRzX0hlYWQtTGlnaHRzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">headlights</a> are an important safety feature to be used at night or when visibility is poor, but they only help the driver to notice the hazard. To avoid the hazard or get round it he has to use the steering wheel. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNDUvU3RlZXJpbmctV2hlZWxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">steering wheel</a> lies at one end of the steering system and it is operated by the driver. The driver’s instructions are transmitted to the wheels of the vehicle through a mechanical device or a partly electronic device. Before using it the height of steering wheel has to be properly adjusted so that the driver can easily manipulate it and can see clearly on the road without stretching.

Hood is one such part which gets designers’ attention because it is so placed that it cannot escape being noticed by the onlookers. Designers therefore use it to enhance the looks of a vehicle by making it in attractive designs and styles. However its main function is to protect the engine and the nearby machinery from outside elements like rain, snow etc. A comparatively newly synthesized material like carbon fiber is also used now in making hoods. Such hoods are lighter and hence advantageous. By using such hoods the weight of the whole vehicle is substantially reduced and so less power is required to haul it. Thus by using such hoods you can economize on fuel. Though these hoods are light they are durable and are able to withstand heat. Another advantage of using such hoods is that it reduces weight over the front wheels of the vehicle. That gives the vehicle a better balance and its maneuvering becomes easier.  Carbon fiber is a material that lends itself to be shaped in any design. So you can have carbon fiber hoods in innovative designs. 
<br /><br />A hood protects the engine but if you want to improve its performance you can install a cat back exhaust. Combustion process in the engine results in the formation of some unwanted gases which have to be expelled. While escaping these gases exert some back pressure on the engine which is detrimental to the combustion process. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzQvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9DYXQtQmFjay1FeGhhdXN0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">Cat back exhaust</a> reduces this back pressure and thus improves the efficiency of the engine. The vehicle gives better gas mileage. The cat back exhaust functions like a big funnel which expels the gases by offering an easy passage. The cat back exhaust is installed just after the catalytic converter which reduces the more harmful elements of the spent gases so they are not released in the atmosphere.

And most cars actually do what they are, in a way, told to do with the help of the control systems. And yet you find some cars give a more sure feel while driving and others feel less certain that they will respond exactly as you expect the car to respond. And if you want the feeling of certainty with regard to the response of your car to go up, then you should consider going in for strut bar. Now you may wonder how a suspension related component can have such an impact on how well you are able to control your car.
<br /><br />And the reason is that when you want really high quality control you want the car to respond in a very predictable manner. And for this the car needs to behave as a whole. Now you may wonder what that means after all you don't see a car break up into parts, unless it got into a big accident. But the fact is that though the car may not break up when the car sways in response to a bump or a sharp turn then the car's suspension allows the car to move around, which we call swaying, on the suspension and absorb the shock. And a swaying car will not respond in a very predictable manner because as it sways its center of gravity shifts slightly. Therefore if you want better control you have to reduce the swaying and you can do that with the help of a strut bar.

The car's tires, the streamlined body, the powerful lights, they will all add to the dynamic styling of the car and give it a forceful look. If you will lift the hood and take a look inside you will see an impressive engine with thousands of components all ready to break into a well coordinated act to give you amazing power and control. But amongst all these high profile components that are dynamic and have moving parts, there are also components which seemingly sit around doing very little but yet have a significant bearing on the performance of your car.
<br /><br />So how can a component that has no moving parts and just seems to sit around not doing too much have a significant impact? Well you do get a hint from the streamlined shape of the car. The cars shape has no real moving parts and yet if you will compare the cars of old with the new cars, the new cars are more sleek and are more aerodynamically efficient. But fluids do not flow just outside the car when it is performing. They flow inside the car as well. And if their flow is better streamlined then you can get a better performance from your car. 
<br /><br />For example the exhaust gases need to flow out from each of the car's combustion cylinders and gather into a single pipe which then goes to the catalytic converter. If this flow is not streamlined then the gases will not move fast and there will be a build up of back pressure which the engine will then have to waste power to overcome it. Aftermarket <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzIvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9IZWFkZXJzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">exhaust headers</a> streamline this flow and allow the gases to leave easily. They take into account that different cylinders eject gases at different times and manage the flow better. To further reduce the back pressure you can also consider products such as a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMzQvUGVyZm9ybWFuY2VfRXhoYXVzdF9DYXQtQmFjay1FeGhhdXN0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">cat back exhaust</a> which streamlines the flow beyond the catalytic converter.

Of these some are elaborate and require a lot of time, effort and money for selecting, buying and installing. And there are some products that do not make the car look special enough. And then there are options that are simple but do not last very long for example a unique color pattern that you like for a while but it loses its charm quickly and the car may still look different later but  it no longer reflects your style. Or some modification looks fine but does not last quite as long as the components that came with the stock car. For example a front grille that loses its sheen after a while.
<br /><br />At such a time you will find that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMTYvRXh0ZXJpb3JfQm9keS1TdHlsaW5nX0dyaWxsZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">billet grilles</a> offer a great option that meets all your expectations and which last for a long long time.

Grilles being mounted right in the front of your car have a big impact on its looks and with a small change you will be able to change the personality of your car a lot. 
<br /><br />Of course you need not stop at modifying your car with billet grilles. There are several other exciting products which you can consider.

But at the same time you probably have not given your car a good look for a while now, and since it performs quite well you do not need to pay attention to it because something is not quite right. And yet for most other things in life getting the basic job done is simply not enough. We do not wear clothes that just about cover our body adequately and have no style or personality of their own. We do not eat food that provides all the nutrients but is bland and dull. And we need not drive a car that performs well enough but is otherwise lack luster.
<br /><br />We can add a little life and excitement to our car without spending too much money or putting a big effort. Though you may have seen <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjQvRXh0ZXJpb3JfTGlnaHRzX0J1bXBlci1MaWdodHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">bumper lights</a> on some stock cars they are not quite as exciting as the ones that you can find online by checking out the car aftermarket products on offer. These lights help light the road immediately ahead of the car should the need for that arise. 
<br /><br />A small touch can go a long way in making sure that you get all the enjoyment from your car. Of course you spend a lot of money on the car itself, but in our times a car is not a luxury, it is a necessity, and its only the additional touches that we come up with that give it a luxurious feel. There are many other products that do not cost a lot and can give you great satisfaction since they set your car apart from other similar cars. You can either change your car's looks dramatically all at once by opting for several such products. Or you can from time to time embellish your car with such products. For example you can opt for a custom <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNDUvU3RlZXJpbmctV2hlZWxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">steering wheel</a> which will make your car's interior look special and improve your driving pleasure.

But for many upmarket cars at this time as well, they are lit in a stylish manner because with their prominent location they are a great way to add to the style of the car. And for the onlookers on the road they make the car look extra special as well, because most other cars will not have used their headlights for style with such telling effect.
<br /><br />The popular cars compete tooth and nail to win the buyers affections and there are only a limited number of components where they can look to outdo one another. In such a situation these limited components get refined so much that one can truly say there is no limit to human ingenuity. You would have seen headlights with a halo like ring around them which are called halo headlights or also angel eye headlights. They look distinctive and help set your car apart from thousands of other similar cars.
<br /><br />There are also <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjEvRXh0ZXJpb3JfTGlnaHRzX0hlYWQtTGlnaHRzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">LED headlights</a> which are now available. LEDs need to be more powerful to be used for headlights. But when they are more powerful they need to dissipate a large amount of heat. LEDs do not get heated up front but they do get heated at the back and this heat needs to be taken away quickly otherwise other components and the headlight itself could get damaged. Recently technology has arrived which is able to dissipate this heat effectively enough and LED headlights are the next big thing in automotive lighting. They come with many advantages. They require less power, they light up quickly, they can withstand vibrations, they are very durable and they are also quite cheap. With this long list of advantages it is hardly surprising that the premium car manufacturers have already launched cars featuring LED headlights along with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjIvVGFpbGxpZ2h0c19jbGVhcl90YWlsbGlnaHRzX2V1cm9fdGFpbGxpZ2h0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">LED tail lights</a>.

		<document id="48eedba490c75024264a6108fedecc3" url=""><![CDATA[Tail lights - even more value for your money<br/><br/>There are many ways one can spend on ones car. But only a few products can give you very high value for your hard earned money. So how does a product give great value for your money? So much that it makes other products pale in comparison. Well one way is to give several types of value. So if it is performance related value then it can give value for a higher performance and for a safer performance. It can also add another dimension to its value proposition by offering value in the style department. Here too it can do so in more than one way, one is to enhance style with the help of artistic shape and silhouette and another is to give the car a high tech look which makes it look like it has cutting edge technology at its heart.
<br /><br />And tail lights are one product that can give you this multi faceted value for your money. And that is one reason that after you have bought your stock car and a few years have passed the tail lights will be a great part to replace once its performance loses its edge. A tail light is first and foremost a safety feature and it is very important that high performance is delivered every time. Otherwise in heavy rain with the spray coming off the road from your car's tires the driver of your car may not be able to spot your car and that would be a big risk. Therefore going in for new tail lights which are bigger and brighter makes a lot of sense. 
<br /><br />Then they are the corner stone of the styling of the car when seen from the rear. And when you get the latest tail lights such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjIvVGFpbGxpZ2h0c19jbGVhcl90YWlsbGlnaHRzX2V1cm9fdGFpbGxpZ2h0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">LED tail lights</a> your car will get back its contemporary cutting edge looks. And if you find that these new automotive lighting really gives great value for your money then you can get smart new <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMjQvRXh0ZXJpb3JfTGlnaHRzX0J1bXBlci1MaWdodHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">bumper lights</a> installed as well.

And that is not an easy task. It is not simply about getting great products and charging a fair price. A store has to have very efficient operations to be able to get high quality products to a customer at very low prices. And as far as being efficient is concerned online stores have an edge because they save a lot by not having a fancy large brick and mortar store. Of course an online store does not run by itself and the back end processes need to be taken care of and here again lies the opportunity to have very efficient processes. Though here care must be taken that the efficiency is not at the expense of customer experience. People rightly still expect the courtesy and attention offered by brick and mortar stores and so an online store needs to be prompt in its communication.
<br /><br />At <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Ilovebodykits.com</a> we try hard to give you the best possible experience. And for this we offer you amazingly low prices and yet have high quality of products and also that of customer service.

The racquet, one can expect, will be very refined and would be able to help you make great shots. But you will still not be able to play like Federer can. It is for this reason that along with the great racquet a professional tennis player will get the right shoes and clothes so that the player has the best chance of putting up a strong display. And like wise if you have a car that is capable of great performance then you need to make sure that the driver of the car is suitably enabled to make the car perform as well as it can.
<br /><br />And just like a tennis player needs great tennis shoes a high performance car needs <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8yNzAyL1JhY2luZy1TZWF0cy5odG1s" target="_blank">racing seats</a> so that the driver of the car can confidently drive the car at top speeds through tight curves. The shoes give support no matter which direction the player needs to propel himself or herself and similarly no matter which direction the inertial forces push the driver the racing seats will provide adequate support and the driver will not sway. Racing seats also look nice and give your car a high performance high tech look. You can do more to enable the driver to control the car optimally once you have got going with racing seats.
<br /><br />For example you can opt for a custom <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNDUvU3RlZXJpbmctV2hlZWxzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">steering wheel</a> which is more suitable to your style of driving. The steering wheel will further enhance the interiors of your car as well. A cool looking car that is fun to drive and delivers a high performance is the stuff that childhood dreams are made of and you can make your dream come true without spending a lot of money or putting a great effort. Both racing seats and the steering wheel have affordable options and they do not take long to install. And you can buy them confidently, quickly and conveniently by going online. You can also hope to find some great deals. You can see these cool products at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilovebodykits.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ilovebodykits.com</a></a>.

They have a streamlined aerodynamic design and can get from zero to hundred miles an hour in the blink of an eye so to say. But if you were to drive one of these cars, the car that you will like the best may not necessarily be the one that was the most powerful. It is more likely to be the one that had the best controls. Just like a very strong man cannot win an Olympic medal for a javelin throw by using sheer strength alone, similarly a great performing car needs to have great controls to match.
<br /><br />Now you may have a car that you would like to take to its limits but the controls do not allow you that luxury. And so you will want to enhance how well you can control the car. And one way to do that is to opt for lowering kits which will make the car more stable at high speeds and therefore easier to control.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xNjAvTG93ZXJpbmdfU3ByaW5ncy5odG1s" target="_blank">Lowering kits</a> have a key component lowering springs these reduce the height of the suspension of the car and thereby they lower the center of gravity. The lower center of gravity makes the car more stable when it is turning through tight corners and your need for control is the greatest. It is a simple way to improve the handling of your car. A lower slung car also looks sleek and more like a high performance car. So you get that additional benefit as well. 
<br /><br />You can also add other products to add stability to your car and improve its controls. For example a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS8xMDgvQ2FyX1Nwb2lsZXJzX0NhcmJvbl9GaWJlcl9TcG9pbGVycy5odG1s" target="_blank">car spoiler</a> will make your car hug the road more at high speeds giving you a more assured feel when you maneuver the car while your are driving fast. Once you have great control you can enjoy the high performance to the limit while keeping risks low. You can buy these products easily by going online. They do not cost a lot and give you great value. You can see them at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbG92ZWJvZHlraXRzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ilovebodykits.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ilovebodykits.com</a></a>.
