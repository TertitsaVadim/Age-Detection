<br /><br />Do you remember February 1993 when a young boy of 3 was taken from a
<br />Liverpool shopping centre by two 10-year-old boys?
<br /><br />Jamie Bugler walked away from his Mother for only a second. Jon Venables
<br />took his hand and led him out of the mall with his friend Robert Thompson.
<br /><br />They took Jamie on a walk for over 2 and a half miles, along the way
<br />stopping every now and again to torture the poor little boy who was crying
<br />constantly for his Mummy.
<br /><br />Finally they stopped at a railway track where they brutally kicked him,
<br />threw stones at him, rubbed paint in his eyes, pushed batteries up his anus,
<br />and cut his fingers off with scissors. Other mutilations were inflicted but
<br />not reported in the press.
<br /><br />What these two boys did was so horrendous that Jamie's mother was forbidden
<br />to identify his body.
<br /><br />They then left his beaten small body on railway tracks so a train could run
<br />him over to hide the mess they had created.
<br /><br />These two boys, even being boys, understood what they did was wrong, hence
<br />trying to make it look like an accident.
<br /><br />This week Lady Justice Butler-Sloss has awarded the two boys
<br />anonymity for the rest of their lives, when they leave custody with new
<br />identities. They will also leave custody early only serving just over half
<br />of their sentence.
<br /><br />They are being relocated to Australia to live out the rest of their lives.
<br /><br />They disgustingly and violently took Jamie's life away and in return they
<br />each get a new life!
<br /><br />Please. If you feel as strongly as we do, that this is a grave
<br />miscarriage of justice .. Forward this email!!!
<br /><br />Cut and paste this into a new email then add your name at the end, and send
<br />it to everyone you can!

<br />It doesn't matter if you're married, in a relationship, single, gay or straight! A test of your bravery. It will be kept a secret!!
<br /><br />Here's how it works:
<br />Statistically speaking, unless you are a total hermit, social retard, or ugly as a bag of spoiled ass...
<br />There's at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you or sleep with you. So..... lets play &quot;friends with benefits&quot;
<br /><br />The rules are simple... if you want to date the person who posted this, send them a msg saying &quot;I'M YOURS&quot;
<br /><br />If you just want to sleep with them and stay friends, send them a message that says &quot;I'D HIT IT&quot;
<br /><br />THE TWIST IS YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN
<br />&amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you, and maybe more that want to sleep with you.

<br />Little Timmy continues .&quot; if it's okay , i've got a question for you, Miss There are three women sitting on a bench eating ice cream. The first is delicately licking the sides of her triple scoop. The second is gobbling down the top and sucking the cone! And the third is biting off the top of the ice cream.
<br /><br />Which one is married?
<br /><br />The teacher blushes and answers:
<br />well! i suppose it is probably the one who gobbled the top and sucked the cone.
