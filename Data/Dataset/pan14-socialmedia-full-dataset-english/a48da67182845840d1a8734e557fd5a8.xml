<br />During winter holidays I taught my cousin math. Math is the most difficult subject for him, so I decided to first help him review the knowledge he learnt in the first semester. 
<br />I have learned how to be a teacher during the time I teach my cousin, I also learned how to be patient when explain things to people. My cousin is doing very poor in math that he could hardly pass an exam. I picked up some questions from his textbook and asked him to work them out. I found that he couldn’t be able to work any of those questions out. So I worked the first question out and showed him the process clearly. At the same time I also explained why it could be solved in this way. I repeated the process many times just like my math teacher in middle school. He finally could work all those questions out.
<br />After the second semester began I continued to teach him math because he couldn’t understand his math teacher at all. However, we don’t work as harmonious as before because his altitude is not very good. I was angry about it and I have once censured him about it very seriously. Then I found him became sad and the next day he didn’t ask me to help him. I know that I did something wrong because a good teacher would never be impatient to students. I told him some jokes and came to help him actively. I tried to speak as softly as possible and when he did a question wrong I just smiled at him and let him think about it once more. He seemed more relaxed and understood the points in the textbook more easily. What’s more, when I looked at his eyes I could tell whether he was careful or was careless. By watching his behaviors I could tell whether he understood or not. I think these are meaningful skills I gained by teaching my cousin.
<br />in weekends I make plans about how long I should teach him and give him some breaks when we have studied together for about an hour. I learned how to use time properly and plan things in a more efficient way. I think the skill could be used in my future life, too.
<br />I found that when I was helping him, I was also helping myself by learning skills about how to explain some concepts exactly and how to control my mood when I found him absent-minded. I feel that I was really a teacher who is teaching a student, and in my mind I know clearly what I shall do to help him understand. My cousin, who used to hate math very much, asks me to teach him every night now. I am happy to see that he is becoming interested in math and is improving his math grades little by little. I come to know why the volunteers want to spend their time in helping others because it is meaningful and it can also help them to gain more skills.

<br />I joined art club in the beginning of first semester. I like art and I take an active part in the club activities. I have drawn a poster with other members before Halloween for the party and I helped clean the classrooms and decorate classrooms before Halloween party began. Before the first semester ended, I have drawn on the walls in art room with my classmates for a long time. All the activities in art club are creative and attractive that I enjoy them very much.
<br />Before I joined art club, I seldom draw especially with paint and paint brushes. However, when I drew on the paper with brushes without any rules that make painting seem difficult, the pure joy of making an art work made me feel happy. I become more and more interested in art, and I found that I became more creative. When I drew on the walls with classmates, I was strict with the construction of the picture. For the first time I felt that to be accurate is important in drawing, and I measured the length and the proportion with my hands and eyes. I think it‘s a special insight I gained from art club.
<br />Sometimes several people and me shared a little space of paper (wall) and we have some trouble in working together because there was not enough space for every person. We solved this problem by changing the constructions of the picture or taking turns to draw. It also helped me to know how to work with other people. For there is no fixed rules in art club and we can get some ideas in order to increase the rate of our work.
<br />The most important skills to work effectively and safely with others is to be careful and to try our best to make an art work. In the last activity some students from other classes draw a wall with me. After discussion we decided that my job is to draw the person and they wanted to draw the background and we worked together happily. We also respect each other because we really worked hard. One strength of art club is all the activities are interesting and the time for the activities is long, so if anybody can’t be able to come on this weekend, he has the chance to come the next weekend. The weakness of art club is that the rules are too relaxed, so many people are wasting time when others are working, and unfairly they can also get club time because they attended. Because of this reason, although there are many people doing one piece of work, it still takes a long time to finish it. Generally art club is very good because we can draw everything we like during the activity.
<br />With the work of art club, GCA has become more interesting and students in GCA can enjoy various kinds of activities offered by art club. For me, art club offers me club time, and I have gained some interesting abilities about drawing and working with other people.

<br /> went to Henry’s House with my friend Schnee and Bella, on February 23rd.  We went there for a delicious lunch at about 12 o’ clock in the afternoon in Goldenwheel international plaza. We thought about where to go for lunch for a long time and finally we chose Henry’s House because many people recommended us to come for its low price and service.
<br />What we have eaten at Henry’s House was simple. Bella and I ordered a set of pizza. The food there was very delicious. I like eating pizza and I think the pizza there was great.
<br />I like the pizza there because it tasted very delicious and I think the food was fresh, and the sea-food rice was very good, too. The food there was quite different from what I usually eat because they are western food. The environment there made me feel very comfortable because the colours of the restaurant were very soft and harmonious. The restaurant has a main colour of black and the sofas there were red. The only thing that I didn’t enjoy in the restaurant was that it was not very light inside, and I felt uncomfortable when eating in a dark place. The atmosphere there was good, too. It was quiet there and the waiters were polite and gentle, and they served food as fast as possible so I think the service was good. The dark colours and the dark lights there made the restaurant harmonious and balance. Although I don’t like dark place, I must admit that the restaurant is good for both its food and its atmosphere.
<br />During our meal there came some other people which looked like businessmen and some looked like students. They were all very polite and gentle..
<br />I would like to recommend others to come to the restaurant because the food was good and the price was not very high, also the atmosphere there is suitable for people who like to sit alone and think about something because it is quiet there.
<br /><br />Generally I like Henry’s House because the food there was okay and the service was not bad.

<br />I have had a wonderful meal with my classmates and the Grade 12 mentors in a restaurant named Tairyo in Golden Wheel International Plaza which sells delicious Japanese food. I went there by 3:40 p.m. on December 28th with my classmates Vivian, Freddie, Tommy, Leo, nick, Harper, Eric, Brian and our Grade12 mentors Toland, Susan and Frances. We choose this Japanese restaurant because it was said that the food in the restaurant was great and we were interested in Japanese food culture, too.
<br />I ate some kinds of Japanese sushi, some roast beef and chicken there. I also enjoyed the roast fish and Sweet potato porridge. I put different Condiments in the food and had different tastes of food.
<br />I think the food in Tairyo is very amazing. I have had Korean food many times but never Japanese food before because I thought Japanese food was to hot and spicy. But the meal I had in Tairyo was a wonderful experience for me. The delicious sushi was sweet and fresh, I didn’t have any bad feeling about the taste. There were many kinds of vegetables in the sushi and the rice was mild and tasty, too. I am a girl who is used to eating rice and the rice in the sushi was delicious. 
<br />However, there were some differences between the food sold in Tairyo and the food I usually eat. Fish were usually poached in Chinese ways to make food but the fish in Tairyo was fried. Japanese sushi is different from the common dumplings in china. Sushi is made of rice and the famous Chinese snakes such as dumplings and buns are made of wheat. Some Staples in Tairyo were made by poaching rice and vegetables and putting them together in one bowl. But in Chinese food we always eat rice and vegetables separately.
<br />The environment in Tairyo is in Japanese style. The curtains have Japanese paintings on them and the color scheme is black and red, just like the color scheme of many famous Japanese paintings. The compartments are surrounded by curtains and people have to knee and take off shoes when they eat. I think the atmosphere in the restaurant is good and it made me feel like that I am in a restaurant in the ancient Japan. I saw some people who dressed nicely came there, too. I thought that they were businessmen because they had loud discussions during the meals. The service there was good, too. The waitresses there were very responsible for us and they also respected us. They were serving very fast. I highly recommend other people to eat there, but the price was a little high.

<br />There are many clubs in GCA. I joined art club and shopping club in the semester. I am very interested in shopping and I feel curious about the club so I joined the club and I got an account book called Book for Lazy People. I like the book because I am a lazy person.
<br />The activity in Shopping Club is actually carrying out everyday. Every club member need to keep account everyday, and we can choose to write in Chinese or in English. It is very hard for lazy people like me because I often felt troublesome when I took money out of bank and I thought that I need to write “get 200 RMB from bank’ on the book; or when I ate in a restaurant and I spent only 10 RMB for the dinner, and I had to take out my book and write down the account of money I spent. Sometimes I forgot to record on my book and I had to remember what I have spent yesterday or the day before yesterday. However, after keep on recording for about one month, I found that the money I spent was less than last month, I felt surprised and later I realized that keeping a book forced me to think whether it was necessary to buy this or not, and I bought fewer things. One insight I gained from keeping a book is the ability to control the expenses.
<br />Also I continued taking part in the activities in art club in GCA. I continued doing the painting on the wall. In shopping club we seldom had quarrels because our work was individual but in art club we often have quarrels because the limited space. So in the activities in art club, we had to arrive early, took all the materials and took space to draw. People arrived late needed to wait for the others or they had negotiations about the space and paint brushes. However, we enjoyed ourselves in the activities and our creation and painting skills were developed, too.
<br />The strength of shopping club is that it has no limit of time when keeping a book and we had to keep the book for a long time so we are more persevering. The weakness of shopping club is that it is easy to write down all the records in one day. The strength of art club is that the activities are interesting and we can practice painting, but the weakness of art club is that the members in one activity were too many so we couldn’t get enough space to draw.
<br />From keeping a book I learned how to control my money and how to use some tips to save money, and I tried to buy something on the internet for the first time with the help of shopping club although I spent two more days to get it because I gave the seller wrong address. From painting I found my ability to recognize colors become better when mixing colors. I am thankful

<br />There is a public event in Hefei on May 2nd, the On-site Auction of Furniture.
<br />I attended the auction with my mother because I need one person to take photos of me. The auction is held in Golden Sun International Furniture Plaza and it is held from April 28th to May 4th. I want to be an interior designer in the future so I chose to visit the auction in order to get more information about the popularity of furniture at the present. 
<br />I arrived at the plaza with my mother at about 4:30 in the afternoon. The auction is actually an exhibition of furniture and it is held on both the first and the second floor of the plaza. Furniture on the first floor is more expensive than that on the second floor. 
<br />Most of the furniture on the first floor is European and American styles, my mother visited some of them and I feel that I don’t like them because the European style furniture is just like the Victorian furniture in the pictures that were printed on social studies textbook and the heaviness feeling makes me sick. The American style furniture is too sweet and not very suitable for men, and it is very special therefore only a complete set of furniture can unite the style of a room.
<br />I also find that the Chinese Traditional furniture is too dull and it doesn’t express the real style of old Chinese furniture. Usually they just combine western and eastern styles and make them look extremely ugly. Fortunately my mother and I find a shop which sells good red sandal wood and the style is one hundred percent Chinese traditional style. I like the furniture so I take some photos of it. 
<br />From the auction I know that Chinese and western styles are so different that designers can’t combine them carelessly, and I am hoping more and more pure Chinese style furniture appears.

<br />The physical activities I did in the two semesters were various. When I was living in the dormitory, I played outside the dorm building with my friend. After moving to my new apartment room in Nanjing, I went to the bus stop on foot, and I went out with my friend on weekends. During winter holidays, I had fun play with my cousins in the snow and we had competitions on running or climbing the building stairs among one another.
<br />When the second semester began, I started to walk to the bus stop on foot to take the bus, and then walk to school. The bus stop is far from my home therefore I need to walk very fast to get there in time to catch the bus. Because of the heavy traffic, it was hard for the buses to get to the bus stop near school on time, so I usually got off the buses a block before the stop, and then walked fast to school. Sometimes when I carried one or two textbooks with me, it was harder for me to walk so fast and it took me a longer time to get to school.
<br />During exam week I went back and forth twice a day, I went to school to have my exams, and after finishing the exams in the morning, I went back home to have lunch and then ran back to school to have the exams in the afternoon.
<br />I have art classes every week, and the art teacher lives in an old traditional house near a narrow street which is remote from the bus stops. When I first went to his house on foot, it took me nearly one hour to find where his home is. Now I spent nearly fifty minutes to walk to his home. His classes starts very early in the morning while I like to stay in bed for a long time in the morning, I usually had to run to his house so that I won’t be late for the classes. Thanks to this, I find it not hard for me to run a long distance and I became stronger. 
<br />On weekends when Schnee stayed in Nanjing, I often went out with her. We have been to Hongshan Forest Zoo, Qingliang Mountain, Zhongshan tomb and National Olympic Sports Center. We have been to Hongshang Forest Zoo to visit the cute animals there and we had fun running after each other. The trip to Qingliang Mountain was hard because we had to walk on stairs and we felt tired. We brought some food with us and we had food on the mountain. Because we were going to the Mingxiaoling Museum, thus we planned to go there on foot. We walked past the Purple Mountain and we were running to the museum because the museum closes at 4:30 and we started our hiking at 3:00. The beautiful scene made us happy and satisfied, and we also practiced doing some endurance activities. I believed this could help us to be healthier. 
<br />I learned that endurance activities such as the long running and hiking could help us in a slow but steady way because these activities could make us strong and develop our lungs. I found myself weak before I went to GCA, because I couldn’t finish the 800 meters run when I was in middle school but now it is easy for me. I hope to be strong in running, and I think hiking and walking have made me strong and have the power to run.  As an athlete of climbing the hills, I learned that I can do better if I keep on practicing. And also I learned that a healthy body is very important for me as a student because I can study better when I am strong. I do get stronger because of doing activities. I hope to live in a health lifestyle and I will try to get up early in the morning and sleep early in the nights.

<br /><br />The Exhibition
<br />My friend Schnee and I have attended an exhibition on April 16th, 2010. The exhibition was held on the second floor of Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum Museum in No 1 Sifang City. 
<br />The title of the exhibition is Master Jinwen Yun Brocade Art Gallery. The artist is a man called Jinwen. Jinwen is very good at making Yun Brocade. Yun Brocade was created in Yuan Dynasty, and was developed fast in Ming and Qing Dynasty. Nowadays, Yun Brocade is still developing and widely used in fashion industry. Therefore, the great artist Master Jinwen has spent thirty years of his life in researching and designing Yun Brocade, and finally he became the Master of Chinese Art Craft. The exhibition included his best work in Yun Brocade making.
<br />All the Yun Brocade shown in the exhibition is made by Master Jinwen in the past thirty years, and because Yun Brocade was created in Yuan Dynasty, it is still the Chinese Traditional style. However, the exhibition also showed us some Yun Brocade from Ming and Qing Dynasty, and I can see the differences between it and the work of Jinwen because the decorative pattern on it is different. The work of Jinwen is more contemporary and the old Yun Brocade is traditional. There were also some pieces of work that had Olympic mascots on them, and they were somewhat contemporary.
<br />There was one piece of Yun Brocade work that attracted me. Its title is Contemporary: Yellow Background with Lotus Leave Pattern Woven with Gold Thread. The background is yellow and there are flowers and leaves on it. There are some patterns of flowers and leaves that repeat in the work, and the colour of the flowers and leaves are different although the shapes of flowers and leaves are the same.
<br />The work also gave me a sense of feeling of the palaces in the Forbidden City because in ancient China yellow was the royal colour. In the old days only emperors could wear yellow clothes. I thought of the chairs and beds of emperors’ because they were yellow, too. The difference is that there were always dragons on the brocade for the emperors. I remembered the scene I had seen in the film The Last Emperor, the last emperor Pu Yi had some clothes like this Yun Brocade. It also gave me idea of patterns; as I said before, the shapes of the flowers in the patterns in the artwork are the same but the colours of the flowers are different. I think the artist’s intention is to archaize the old artwork. 
<br />I think the artwork is successful because it is beautiful and it succeeded in archaizing the old Yun Brocade and made them more modern. I think it is also a good artwork because it made me feel fresh and it made me think of many things. I think to judge whether an artwork is successful or not depends on if it can clean people’s mind and bring them to the world of its own. I think the artwork did bring me to the ancient China so it is good. However, I won’t buy this artwork because it is difficult to keep a piece of Yun Brocade and I am afraid of ruining the artwork because of careless behaviour.

<br />I went to St. Polo Church which is a Protestant church on April 18th in the afternoon. I attended there at about 2:00 p.m. The church is located at No 396 in the Taiping East Road. I went there with my friend Schnee. We chose this kind of religion because Protestant is the most familiar religion to us. The church holds religious service four times on weekends, once on Saturdays and three times on Sundays. 
<br />There were many people sitting inside the church when we arrived. There are two rows of chair in the church. Above each row there are a row of pendant lamps. The church is gothic style and it is the first Protestant church in Nanjing. The environment around the church is good, there are many flowers, shrubs and trees around the church building. The building is wrapped by cirrus. Inside the church the ceiling is Chinese traditional style and the pulpit is in the end of the house, and it is red.
<br />After the choir finished singing songs, the priest standing behind the pulpit started speaking, and there were two boy wearing white cloth standing on both side of the priest. The speaking lasted a long time and everybody in the church looked at their papers except us two. After the speech was over, the choir sang a song again and then the speech resumed. Then a the people stood up and sang a song. Then speech began and then people sang songs.
<br />Although I don’t think the religious service is boring, I feel the service is too long. I have been to many Buddhist temples and people can go there at any time in the day, but the church only opens to people on weekends. I am a Buddhist, and I learned a lot from this religious service. I know more about the Missale and the psalms. The main point of both Protestant and Buddhism is the same which is to tell people to be kind to others and endure hardships

<br />Today I interviewed my art teacher Mr Wang, who teaches me painting and sketching. He lives in a small traditional Chinese house with a big garden. Some trees are grown in the garden. I interviewed him in his study which is full of papers and sculptures. I think this is what an artist’s study should be like.
<br />I started with a question: what major are you in the university? He answered: my major in university is fine arts and I was study in Nanjing Normal University. I asked him how he trained and he answered that he had learned many kinds of art knowledge in university such as colour, design, calligraphy, Chinese painting, education, psychology, philosophy, and foreign language. His job involves teaching students who can’t draw and give them a basic concept of art. Mr. Wang first started his job because the university he dreamed of didn’t accept him and he had to choose to study in another university. The reason why he chose to study art was that there were not enough art teachers in Nanjing at that time and his father was a painter, so he decided to study art. Mr. Wang thinks that the greatest benefit he have ever had is the progress made by his students. He feels happy when his students become better and better at drawing and he thinks the money he makes every term satisfied him, too. Therefore he has nothing to complain and he thinks there is no drawback to be an art teacher. His favourite artist is Rembrandt. He thinks his artworks are both harmonious and speculate. All his artworks showed his skilled craft. His favourite artwork of the artist is his copper engravings. He thinks that Rembrandt expresses great art language with his artwork. He also set him as an example when he teaches me.
<br />I have also asked him some other questions such as how a day in his life like. He thinks that his life is simple but meaningful because he teaches students and helps students to gain the skills they want. He feels pride when his students are accepted by their dream art university or when they get a good major in university because of high scores in art test. He also faces many challenges because the levels of his students are different, some of them are very poor at drawing and he needs to do his utmost to help them to make some progress. The challenge is even greater when he meets some students who have no talent at all and he feels extremely tired when teaching them. However, he doesn’t want to give up. I admire his spirit and I know it is the spirit that every teacher has. 
<br />I feel happy to interview him and we take a photo together. I also feel sorry because my interview takes his lunch time. I think to be an art teacher is fun because an art teacher can make artwork and at the same time he can make money, too.

<br /> Performance
<br />I went to a concert on April 24th in the evening. The concert began at 19:00 and ended at21:00. the concert was held in a restaurant called La table de M.Eiffel that is located in No 83 on Guangzhou Road, inside the Qingliang shan Park. The concert was held by a French singer called Jil Caplan, along with two other men, one played the guitar and the other one played the drum.
<br />I went to the concert along and I arrived at the restaurant at 19:30. I choose this concert because Jil Caplan is a jazz singer, and I haven’t been to any concert that was held by a jazz singer or a French singer, therefore I choose this concert.
<br />When I arrived at Qingliang shan Park, I could not find where the restaurant was so I followed two foreigners step by step and I found the back door of the restaurant which was very small and people who haven’t been there before could hardly find where it is. I thought it was strange to hold a concert in such a small place, and I thought perhaps artists like these strange place. When I enter the restaurant, I found it is a Chinese traditional style house, and the area where the three artists performed was a big room full of foreign people. Because I attended there late, the singer was surrounded by big, tall people and I could hardly see them. Therefore I had to stay outside the crowd and listen. The songs were beautiful, but I didn’t like their way of singing. I think their way of singing made me feel that they could not breathe well. Therefore I didn’t like the concert in general and I felt indifferent about the concert.
<br />However, the songs were beautiful and the concert showed me a different way of singing. I am not interested in music and I like folk music only. Thus the concert gave me a new impression of singing. I know that there are some ways to perform a song other than pop, folk and rock, and although jazz came from rock, in my view, they are quite different from each other in the way they are performed. It is a pity that I still can enjoy this type of music.

<br />There was an earthquake happening in Yushu in Qinghai, I feel sorry for people live in Yushu so I decide to do something for them during the Mayday holiday. I make a phone call to the Red Cross in Anhui and tell them I want to volunteer for them. 
<br />Because I am a high school student, in my two days work of volunteering, the main work for me was to stay in the office on duty, and I also needed to answer the phone calls that were made by people who had questions about the account number and the post code of Red Cross. I felt interested when first started the job and I answered every phone call with nice soft voice, but after three hours answering the phone, I felt bored, and I was too tired to move my tongue at all. Because of the earthquake in Yushu and because people are free during Mayday holiday, there were more and more people calling to ask questions, and I had to compel myself to answer the phone. It was hard especially when I was impatient but I still had to pretend as if I was patient and answer the phone gently. I had worked for four hours in the first day, and I felt like going bananas. In the evening when university students came back to the office, I helped them to count the money that they collected from the citizens during the daytime actively. 
<br />The second day was much better than the first day because I have practiced the day before. On that day my work was still sitting in the office and answering the phone. Some people called to ask if they could get a certificate because they have given a lot of money to Yushu. I wrote their names and the amount of money down carefully then gave them to administrator Mrs. Sun to affix a seal. I tried to answer the phone using a smart way. I wrote down the questions that were likely to be asked and when people called to ask these questions, I could read the answer without thinking, and this method made me less tired. After finishing my work, I helped to carry some boxes full of drinks that were used for charity sale and helped elder volunteers count the money again.
<br />After finishing working in the Red Cross, I feel that my two days in Hefei are meaningful because this is the first time for me to help so many people who are generous and sympathetic. I am glad that I can help them and help people in Yushu indirectly. The two-day working experience also let me know some manners when answering the phone such as speaking politely and gently, and I have practiced to catch the main points in conversations. I took my own responsibilities and I also helped others actively, and I think these are very important in my working life. I think I gained some basic employability of secretary although I don’t want to be a secretary.

<br />I went to Beijing with my mother in the summer vacation, and I have spent a month in Beijing. During this period of time, I went to the playground of Beijing Haidian Foreign Language School every evening to go jogging with my mother.  I spent one hour jogging and walking with students there. For most of the time I jogged around ten times without taking a stop, and then walked around several times while chatting with my mother. Some times I chose to listen to music or the sixty-second science when I was jogging around to beguile the boring time. In the beginning it was hard for me to continue jogging for one hour without a break, but later on, as I kept on jogging everyday, it became an easy case for me.  In the last few days of my journey in Beijing, I was even able to jog around for ten times while talking and laughing with my jogging partners. I felt happy about the change in my body that I became healthier than before.
<br />When I came back to my hometown Fuyang, my cousins invited me to their houses and played badminton with me. Since my skills were poor, they spent a long time practice with me until we were all tired of playing. Then we stopped the game and had a short break. After that we continued playing. Since I had practiced before when I was at school, I became more proficiency playing badminton and I could catch the shuttle more easily. Therefore the game between my cousin and I could go on without stopping picking up the shuttle many times.  I did have a good time playing badminton with my kind cousins.
<br />In these activities, I enjoyed jogging as an athlete and when I was playing badminton I learned more skills and practical experiences as a competitor. During the month I spent in Beijing, I became more endurance and I think I have the experience of keeping on doing one thing and I finally get fitness during the process. After that, I have gained a good habit of jogging everyday and I think that is efficient and possible for me to develop more good habits. When I was playing with my cousins, I learned to work within a team and I was more about to catch the shuttle. It also gave me happiness and made me know that my reaction to these quickly-happened things is not very quick. Keeping on jogging made my body healthier and I learned to stick to one thing that I want to do. Playing with my cousins gave me happiness, and made me become better at badminton. It also left me a good memory. My personal fitness goal is to jog half an hour per day and to be better in playing badminton. I did more jogging than I planed but I am still not good at playing badminton. Because of my journey to Beijing I didn’t have much time and space to practice playing badminton but jogging is more convenient.

We met at the gate of Nanjing Library in the cold morning wind of early spring and later there was a huge rain. We crowded together under my small umbrella and realized the meaning of “devoting to art” for the first time.
<br />There is a small plaza between Jiangsu Art Museum and Nanjing Library. We crossed the plaza quickly and burst into the art museum with soak clothes. However, I did not feel uncomfortable because the paintings soon gasped my attention. There were a great collection of paintings hanging on the walls, categorized by names of their creators. Those paintings are all done by famous young Chinese artists.
<br />Most of the paintings were landscape and were created by the Chinese traditional way of using ink to create different layers to show the solid shape and light effects, while other paintings were portraits or modern objects such as sculptures and buildings. I found some interesting art works at the exhibition, too. Two of the art works was created by a female artist called Yu Hui and she painted many detailed stones arranged in a strange way so that they looked like something else. She named one of this kind of paintings “The Dream of the Butterfly” because the stones in the painting are pink and looked like a flying butterfly. The other one is called “The Rose” because the arrangement of the stones looks like that of the petals of a rose. However, only one painting really impressed me a lot and touched me to the heart. The name of the painting is “Looking Back from a Hundred Years Ago”. It is a painting of the presidential palace in Nanjing and the visitors around that place. I saw people ranging from children to the old gathering around in front of the Presidential Palace. There are children playing, old people sitting with their fans, talking with one another with smiles and young people wearing fashionable clothes. When I saw this painting I thought that the people of the whole Nanjing City were represented in this small but delicate image. I saw different people with different facial expressions and gestures, drawn in the painting using the traditional meticulous brushwork, and felt strong connection with the painting. 
<br />    I have seen few Chinese traditional portraits before. Most of the portraits I saw were western paintings and they left my little impression because I do not like the elaborate style. I used to learn sketch and painting, and I know that to create a realistic painting with proper light effect one must practice a lot and using pencils to draw the boundaries of light and dark. That is the only thing I dislike about western painting because the painters divided a whole object into small pieces according to the different levels of light each of them received. In my opinion drawing should be like what Chinese people have done for thousands of years: draw the object as a whole. Many Chinese artists used a big brush to draw the petals of a peony, and they created the three dimensional feelings by simply adjusting the ratio of water and ink needed on the brush. Usually t drawing the silhouette of the flower is the last step because they did not want the outline to confine their brush to create a lively flower.

The theme of the exhibition is Chinese traditional art. Many of the paintings presented there were painted 50 years ago to illustrate the society at that time. Others were merely landscaping paintings.
<br />I almost lost myself in watching those paintings because I enjoy Chinese traditional paintings a lot. I saw meticulous brushworks of lotus, peonies, peacocks, crane and other natural creatures. Three paintings named after different phenomena of winds did not actually have solid winds in them, but the shape of floating water, the direction to which the branches and leaves of trees deflect and the different colours of the sky all indicate the existence of the winds. Some paintings were about the beautiful natural scene in Yunnan and Qianxi, and the painter used green, blue colours skillfully that the paintings looked like fluorescent paintings in a distance. There were also paintings of ancient people. I love the portraits of the Buddha and the characters in the Chinese traditional novel “Dream of the Red Mansion”. But what really did catch my heart were two paintings showing the life of fishermen on a river. These paintings were painted in ink only. The floating muddy water, the reed growing along the bank and the boat anchoring by the bank all could be seen but not clearly. Looking at these paintings, I felt that the life of fishermen and their families were like a movie showing before my eyes: women and children live inside the boat, and men standing at the buttock of the boat catching fish. At night, there is only a beam of dim light escaping from the crack of the window, women are cooking and men are resting.
<br />I love this exhibition because I love anything related to art especially Chinese traditional art. Before I went to the exhibition, I did know about Chinese traditional art but only about famous ancient painters and their works. Now I saw many modern artists who did not abandon their national treasure but keep it and create more splendid works based on it.

Among all these different kinds of work, I think volunteer in parent-teacher meetings is the most valuable and beneficial experience.
<br />There are two parent-teachers meeting in Grade 11 and I have worked as volunteer in both meetings. In the first meeting, I worked as the timer of Mr. Lawlor and my work was to make sure every parent get the same amount of time to talk with the teacher. In the second meeting I worked as a line keeper for Mr. Burgar and I need to keep waiting parents in line. Although the work was simple and easy, I had to do it for six hours.
<br />To meet the requirements for parent-teacher meeting volunteers, I had to wear suit to look formal. Also I need to know where other teachers sat so that I could tell confused parents when they asked me for help. When I worked as volunteer in the meeting for the first time I was nervous and I fell down twice because I wore a pair of high heels. The job as a timer seemed to be easy at first, but after an hour or two I found it hard for me to concentrate when I need to watch the time carefully. My mind went away several times and when I realized that the time was beyond five minutes, I felt guilty for my neglect. In order to avoid this to happen again I tried to step around to make sure my mind did not go anywhere else. When I volunteered for the parent-teacher meeting for the second time, my job seemed to be more relaxed because I got familiar with it. However, standing on the high heels for six hours was still a tiresome experience to undergo. As a line keeper, I need to watch the timer’s gesture so that when a parent finished his or her conversation with the teacher, I could immediately tell the next to go and talk to the teacher.
<br />When I finished my job, I always felt proud for myself because I kept working from the beginning to the end. I learned many things during the process by doing my job well and observing what others were doing. I learned how to stay concentrate and how to give a most concise while understandable explanation. Also during the process I found that I still need to be more endurable because I got impatient easily and I often wanted to stop working because of the boring work. However, each time I finished the job, I had a feeling that I had conquered my laziness and become more mature and responsible. I believe this kind of experience can make me more adapted to hard and boring work I may have in the future, and I can be responsible despite my unwillingness of doing the job.

I worked with other leaders of art club and put a lot of effort in doing these jobs. Decorating was a long and somewhat boring task, and to organize other volunteers was also a difficult job for me because I have never done this kind of jobs before.
<br />Before the decoration we leaders needed to buy materials and to consult art teacher to get some advice about decorating. Also we were responsible for clean up after the other people went away. In the Halloween decoration we spent one or two hours after school for a week to decorate the lobby. We stick decorations on the walls and ceilings, and paint on the walls and dustbins to create horrible atmosphere. Also I joined the activity of drawing Christmas poster before decoration and spent my weekend decorating the lobby with Ms Lefebvre. I even organized an activity of baking Christmas ornaments using flours with Ms Lefebvre after school with other art club members. 
<br />I learned a lot from the process of decoration. I learned how to organize people effectively so that everybody would be doing their own work, how to collaborate with other people and how to use limited materials efficiently. When I first worked with new students from Grade 10 for the Halloween decoration, I did not know how to organize them because they did not want to listen to me at all. To solve this problem, I collected necessary materials together and when they came to take materials, I told everybody what their jobs were and they seemed to understand. A lot of people liked to talk while working and they soon forgot which was more important. I tried to shout to stop them but that did not work, so I assigned tasks to them and told them they could leave as soon as they finished their tasks. In order to leave early, they stopped playing and worked very effectively and quickly. For people who were responsible and hard-working, other leaders and I praised them and showed them our gratitude. Also I tried to distribute and retrieve limited tools such as scissors and tapes effectively so that people could find them when they needed.
<br />From doing the volunteer work I found many weaknesses in my characteristics and I learned how to correct them. I think these experiences taught me some necessary skills as a leader such as the ability to organize people and to increase the work efficiency. These kinds of skills can save the time needed to finish a task. I am glad to have these work experiences because I gained skills from it and beautified the GCA lobby as well. I will not be very nervous and wondering what to do in the future when I get similar tasks in my work because I have learned some skills to work with others and to work effectively.

<br />I joined literature society in the beginning of Grade 11 because I am interested in literature and wanted to make my life in GCA as interesting as possible. I have taken an active part in the activities the leaders of literature society have organized and I have gained a lot of fun from participating in these activities. 
<br />I am very active in this club and I attend almost every meeting held by the leaders. The first activity the literature society has organized is the scenario competition. I thought this activity very interesting and attractive so I joined it and wrote a ten-minute long scenario for the competition. Before I began to write, I spent 2 weeks thinking a creative idea and conceiving the plot. At first I want to write about a story of the ordinary life of a high school student and the conflict between parent and child because of the different viewpoints of life and success. However, this idea is so complicated and deep to me that I had no confidence to depict every character accurately. Later I want to write about the life of Chinese students in a western school and how their traditional ideas about life and the world were challenged by western ideas. And I thought this idea too common. Finally I wrote a scenario about an astronaut returning to earth from a space traveling and found the world had changed dramatically. Although I did not get a place in the competition, I still felt happy about writing this scenario because I personally was satisfied with it and felt proud of it.
<br />In order to write the scenario properly, I searched on the internet and found a lot of information about writing a scenario. I learned how to write a complete scenario with proper formation and I supplemented my vocabulary by searching for words I did not know in the dictionary when writing. I found my grammar weak and my ability to make sentence pattern various poor. I
<br />I also gained insight about myself during writing the scenario and after I finished it. During the process of writing I always felt that I knew too little about the English language and lack professional knowledge about science and space travelling. I tried to make the end sad and impressive, but instead I felt funny and false when I read it again after finishing which showed my lack of control over words and the theme. Also I thought I chose a wrong idea. It would be better if I choose to write things happened around me because I am more familiar with high school life than with space travelling.
<br />One weakness of the club is that members do not get many chances to work together with one another. However, the club holds meeting regularly and formally so members won’t get confused about what to do in the activities. Although I did not work with other members, I did read some other scenarios and found many advantages of other scenarios.

The first time we went to a Singaporean restaurant called Star. Jade in December and then in March we went to a French restaurant called Pimiento. Star Jade is located at No.280-11 Hankou Road in Baixia District. We choose to go to this restaurant because some friends of us went there before and thought the food there was awesome. Pimiento is near the bus stop of Yunnan Road. We went there because we saw many people on the internet praise the atmosphere and food there.
<br />Here I want to write about my dinner at Pimiento. My friends and I went there on March 13th, 2011. I ordered handmade tagliatelli with carbonara sauce. Serance ordered salmon farfalle, Emma ordered tagliatelli with basil and vegetable sauce and Crystal ordered union station steak with fish and beef.
<br />The food there is different from what I usually eat. The tagliatelli has different taste from that of the noodles I ate before although I did not enjoy it. I did not like the sauce and the tagliatelli because I thought they were too dry and tasteless. But the free soup tasted great with toast. 
<br />The atmosphere of Pimiento is wonderful. The color scheme of the room is warm and fresh, and the little decorations on the wall such as wooden shelf and wine gave me an exotic feeling. The atmosphere was like at home. There was a TV on the wall broadcasting sports program and I could smell the food cooking in the kitchen. There was no other person except us, but the wife of the restaurant owner was sitting near us doing her work. The restaurant owner, who is also the cook, welcomed and served us warmly. I really recommend people to go there because of the environment and the service.

My new home is far from school so I brought a bike to ride to school every day. I ride bike to school and then ride back home. It usually takes me I hour to get to school and then go back home. It is fun to ride a bike because riding a bike is not a hard and tiresome process and I could breathe more fresh air than I used to do in the bus. Also I get to exercise my body at the same time because riding a bike need the corporation of legs, arms, eyes and brain. I use my legs as a motor to create mechanical power to push my bike and I forward. I use my arms to control the direction to which I am going. My eyes watch the road carefully in case that the obstacles and other bike riders on the road won’t hit my bike. My brain has to be wary and careful so that it can control the rest of my body accurately and calmly. 
<br />For over half a year I have been riding a bike to school. When the weather was very cold in the winter and the road got frozen. I fell down from the bike and hurt my left leg. Later I walked to school for that week to get my leg cured naturally. When it was snowing heavily I also rode my bike to school, and I fell down from the bike into could water and snow on the ground with my thick coat and sweater. Sometimes I forgot my gloves at home, and my hands got frozen and numb in the cold winter wind, and I had to hide them in my sleeves to keep them warm. When it snowed no more, it would be easier for me to ride, but sometimes the rain came in the afternoon and I had to ride back home in rain because I forgot to watch the weather broadcast yesterday so I did not bring an umbrella. I even had got a cold because the clothes I wore were too thin to protect my body from the cold wind. From these experiences, I found my living ability was poor and therefore I had to improve my living skills voluntarily. I began to be sensitive to the morning temperature before leaving home so I could wear proper clothes. 
<br />I think I learned a lot from riding a bike to school although it is a simple process. For us Grade 11 students, every minute after school is valuable and we cannot spend too much time on exercising because we have a lot of tests such as TOEFL, IELTS and SAT. A lot of time is required for us to prepare for those tests. Because of this, the one hour activity per day seems to be valuable and effective. I exercised my body and made my characteristics more endurable and persistent.

The concert was held in the Great Hall of People in Nanjing. Two famous Chinese musicians played the piano and the violin at the concert. They were famous pianist Liu Shikun and violin player Sheng Zhongguo. Mr. Sheng Zhongguo even brought his wife, who is another musician here to play with him. Schnee chose this performance because she was interested in music especially in playing violin, and she liked listening to concert a lot. I knew little about music but I would like to know more so I went to the concert with her.
<br />The concert was great. Mr Liu played world-famous piano music of Mr. Beethoven’s. Even though I did not understand the music, I could tell that these pieces of music were hard to play because they consist complicated music segments and tones. Later he played the well-known Chinese Erhu music “Two Spring Reflecting A Moon” using piano. I did not like this music composition because I thought it lost its prominent feature of Chinese traditional music when it was played by a piano. Then Mr. Sheng came to the stage and played Mr. Mozart’s serenade. His wife came to play the piano together.
<br />I must admit that I felt boring during the concert because I could not understand the beauty of western classic music. I would rather listen to a rock concert on TV at home. The concert gave me a feeling of watching a skillful craftsman using the most masterful technique to create an intricate sculpture, but when he finished, I could not tell what the sculpture was.

Participate in a service<br/><br/>This year, as a member of art club, I volunteered at the Halloween party as a facial painter. Eva offered me facial paint Ms Hadley used before and Clare offered me paint brushes. I took some plates and cans from home to use.
<br />At first it cost people who wanted to get facial painting one RMB. Later I decided to let it be a free service. Clare printed out a piece of paper with Halloween feeling images on it such as spiders, pumpkins and crowds of bats. Those were images people could choose to let me draw on their face and hands. They could order other images they like as well. For example, one girl wanted me to draw tooth print on her neck. Another girl let me draw wrinkles on her face. Boys preferred spiders and pumpkins with a witch hat. Although sometimes I made mistakes in painting, these classmates were kind to me and did not get angry at me at all.
<br />I learned a lot from this activity. I practiced my skills of painting, and I became more outgoing by introducing the idea of facial painting to many students. Also I found myself careless because I made mistakes very easily. I began to love my schoolmates more because I found them easy-going and generous. I became more interested in painting as well when I finished painting on some students’ hands and faces. I like this kind of activity and I am always willing to take part in similar activities held by GCA.

ACT IN A PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>During the Art Festival, my classmates and I took part in the performance in front of all GCA students on the third floor of the cafeteria. We performed four songs together wearing red Christmas hats. Although the performance did not seem to be very impressive comparing with other performance, we put much effort in it and rehearsed it for many times after school.
<br />The content of the performance was decided by our class monitor Catherine. When Ms Xue told her about the performance in Art Festival, she began preparing for it. She wanted all of our classmates to participate in the performance so she decided to sing songs together. She chose four songs “Peerless”, “Dilemma”, “I Love Rock and Roll” and “Last Christmas”. Serance planned our standing position on that stage and told us how to get to our own position as quick as possible. She divided us into two groups, and decided to let Miles play harmonicon in the end.
<br />Before we entered the stage I was a little bit nervous because I was afraid of singing out of tone. However, as I went onto the stage with my classmates, I did not feel nervous at all because I knew I was not alone and my classmates and I were standing there supporting one another. I learned four songs I did not know before and I gained experience of performing in front of many people. I also learned more about the organization of people by observing what Catherine and Serance did.
