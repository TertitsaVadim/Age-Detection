For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.&quot; 
<br />Then he said to His disciples, &quot;The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. There will be those who will say to you, 'Look, there He is,' or 'Look, here He is.' Do not go off, do not run in pursuit. For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in His day. But first He must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus is telling us that the kingdom of God is not coming soon, rather He is telling us &quot;Behold, the kingdom of God is among you.&quot; It is here and right now at this moment. And that If He dwells in our hearts. But why is it that we are still looking for it somewhere else? It is because our hearts and minds are full of malice, bitterness, anger, deceit and so on, that is why, the kingdom of God cannot reign in us for we are overshadowed with the evil forces because of our sinfulness. There are times that we are easily angered by little things that others do, most especially to the members of our family, but wait, if we loose them in our lives, would that be enough to ease our anger? Would we not grieve deeply of loosing them? Think about it, so that when the days will come when you will long to see them but they are no longer around, you would not regret forever? If Jesus is physically here with us right now, will we be the new generation to make Him suffer again and reject Him? Let us think and ask ourselves about it? And renew our ways and say: &quot;The kingdom of God is here.&quot; All we have to do, is to empty ourselves with all the things that holds us from entering into a new life of true happiness, peace and love. A forgiving and loving heart remains after we have learned to empty ourselves from everything that does not belong to God. We have to let go of everything and start receiving the true graces and virtues that Mother Mary pours on us when we have let go of them and these will sustain us and will make us persevere. Always be on guard not to let a single or a little point of entry for sin to rule in our heart. Be pure in mind, body and soul. And the kingdom of God will reign forever in our hearts and anywhere we go, we bring great joy and true peace to others.

<br /><br />Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man; they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. Similarly, as it was in the days of Lot; they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all. So it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day, a person who is on the housetop and whose belongings are in the house must go down to get them, and likewise a person in the field must return to what was left behind. Remember the wife of Lot. Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will save it. I tell you, on that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken, the other left. And there will be two women grinding meal together; one will be taken, the other left.&quot; They said to Him in reply, &quot;Where, Lord? He said to them, &quot;Where the body is, there also the vultures will gather.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus is telling us that because of the many material possession that holds us, we cannot focus on the salvation of God. &quot;Eating, drinking, marrying...buying, selling, planting, building...There must be more to life than all these. Life is more than the usual tasks and routines and obligations. We often get lost in earning a living without finding a life. We get swallowed by life's daily tasks, needs and obligations and miss life's celebrations and the beauty of creation. Seeing the beauty of creation reflects the Artists Himself, and that is why there is so much to enjoy in this life and be always connected with our Creator. Live life and offer everything to Jesus through Mary so that we will never miss every detail of it and enjoy it. Enjoy life and learn every lessons that comes along with it. Taste and cherish the moments before they rush to memories. Do not skip the chances or they will skip you. Of the two persons that Jesus referred to in the Gospel, one will enjoy life, while life will pass by the other. 
<br /><br />Everything in this life is good but they are all passing, so let us look beyond this life. Let us not set our minds and hearts on these material possessions we have, for they will control us. And the more we have them, the more we crave for more and the more we become proud. And God does not want that to happen and He can take them anytime He wants to. So instead of being proud, we should be thankful and grateful and that we will learn to acknowledge that everything comes from Him. And without God we are nothing. If we desire only what God desires for us, we will be protected against the snares of evil forces, and we will live a holy life. &quot;Where the body is, there also the vultures will gather.&quot;

He said, &quot;There was a judge in a certain town who neither feared God nor respected any human being. And a widow in that town used to come to him and say, 'Render a just decision for me against my adversary.' For a long time the judge was unwilling, but eventually he thought, 'While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being, because this widow keeps bothering me I shall deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me.' &quot;The Lord said, &quot;Pay attention to what the dishonest judge says. Will not God then secure the rights of His chosen ones who call out Him day and night? Will He be slow to answer them? I tell you, He will see to it that justice is done for them speedily. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?&quot;
<br /><br />Prayer is not so much for God to listen, God already knows what we are asking for, as for us to be strengthened in our faith. God has no need for our praise and prayers, but we need it to keep on believing, holding on, and to pray unceasingly. St. Francis of Assisi said: &quot;Prayer is a source of grace and preaching is the channel which distributes the graces which one have received from heaven.&quot; When we unceasingly pray, we become reservoir of graces and we have to maintain it that it is always filled in order to be shared. So always have that Spirit of Prayer. Here are some points to remember: Pray solely to please God; It is better to ask God for graces than to meditate much; He who prays the most receives the most; continually ask God for the gift of Divine Love and make frequent Acts of Love to Him during the day; To overcome temptation, always have a recourse to God and His Blessed Mother through unceasing prayer; and to obtain God's Grace, pray with perseverance. When we pray we do not really hear God's voice speaking to us, but it is through the words we speak in prayer that we hear God speak to us. All we need is to believe that what we pray will be granted to us. But always keep in mind that in praying, we should also consider what to ask, for God might just give it to us right there and then and we are not yet ready to accept it or the consequence of it. When we pray ask that &quot;Lord, Jesus Christ, if what I ask is not for God's greater glory or for the good of my soul, grant me what is most pleasing to your infinite goodness. Amen.&quot; There is nothing more powerful than a man who prays!

They told him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&quot; He shouted, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me!&quot; The people walking in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent, but he kept calling out all the more. &quot;Son of David, have pity on me!&quot; Then Jesus stopped and ordered that he be brought to him; and when he came near, Jesus asked him, &quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; He replied, &quot;Lord, please let me see.&quot; Jesus told him, &quot;Have sight; your faith has saved you.&quot; He immediately received his sight and followed Him, giving glory to God. When they saw this, all the people gave praise to God.
<br /><br />In some way or the other, we are like this blind beggar. We are physically able to see, yet sometimes we choose not to see things or to select what to see. We only want to see the things we like seeing and ignoring those things that needs to be seen and acted upon, yet we overlooked them. The blind beggar in the Gospel first called out to Jesus, addressing Him as &quot;Jesus, Son of David!&quot; then when people told him to be silent, the more he persisted shouting and this time addressing Jesus as &quot;Son of David,&quot; as if losing hope that he will be heard. But when Jesus stopped and ordered that he will be brought to Him, there was sudden conversion in this man that he addressed Jesus as &quot;Lord&quot;. Sometimes we are also like this man, that when the more we pray and seems that our prayers are left unanswered we tend to become hopeless. But let us never be, for Jesus always hears us and He always listens to us. Even if Jesus knew what the blind beggar wants from Him, yet He asked the blind beggar, &quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; In the same manner, even if Jesus knew what we need, yet He also wants us to be particular and specific in our prayers. That is why we should pray daily or as often as possible so that our need for that particular moment is met. When asking for our needs we don't need a litany of supplications or petitions, all we need is our true intention and a particular grace to meet our needs and we should address our prayers in faith and necessity. So that by the time our prayers are granted, we will realize there and then the speedy answers of God to that particular prayer, most especially if we course them to Jesus through His Beloved Mother, Our Blessed Virgin Mary. Jesus always answers our prayers but the thing is that, because we ask in a manner of a litany of requests, we also expect them to be answered all together, that is why we kept on waiting for all the answers while missing all the graces that were poured on us, as God's speedy and concrete answers to our prayers. We should discern and reflect on our necessity for that particular moment and pray in a positive outlook that you will get what you are asking for and most of all pray unceasingly. And when we ask for healing, we should first let go of all the negative feelings in our heart, so that we will have that pure and true faith. As Jesus told the blind beggar, &quot;Have sight; your faith has saved you.&quot; We should also respond in a positive way the prayers that we say. And when our prayers are answered, let us also share them to others that particular encounter with God, and in that way we are glorifying God and in the same way that others will discover and realize God's Glory!

So He said, &quot; A nobleman went off to a distant country to obtain the kingship for himself and then to return. He called ten of his servants and gave them ten gold coins and told them, 'Engage in trade with these until I return.' His fellow citizens, however, despised him and sent a delegation after him to announce, 'We do not want this man to be our king.' But when he returned after obtaining the kingship, he had the servants called, to whom he had given the money, to learn what they had gained by trading. The first came forward and said, 'Sir, your gold coin has earned ten additional ones.' He replied, 'Well done, good servant! You have been faithful in this very small matter; take charge of ten cities.' and the second came, saying, 'Master, your money has earned five more.' Likewise, he said to him, 'You also be over five cities.' Then the other servant came and said, ' Sir, here is your gold coin; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief. for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding person; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what you did not plant.' He said to him, 'With your own words I shall condemn you, you wicked servant. You knew I was a demanding person, taking up what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant; why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my return I would have collected it with interest.' And to those standing by He said, 'Take the gold coin from him and give it to the one with ten gold coins.' I tell you, to everyone who has more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away from him.' But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.&quot; After He had said this, he proceeded on His journey up to Jerusalem.
<br /><br />Jesus is reminding us again of what the kingdom of God is like and what will it be when the Son of Man reigns. He is telling us that God has given each one of us a gift. And He wants us to make good use of them and share them. The more we use them and share them, the more we are blessed. All of us are equally given, yet not all of us made good use of them and willingly shared them, that is why some of us have more, while others have none. It is because when we ignore our own talent and get envious with others' talents, even the least that we have we will lose it. So let us always do within our means and give the best that we can do with it and God will do the rest for us. When we are shy and scared to share our talent, we will lose them, for we will eventually forget that we have such a talent. Share them so that we will enhance them and make them grow. With a trusting and pure heart, always have the courage to try new things and God will entrust you great things. And if we continue to be selfish and proud, we reject God's reign in our hearts. And when we reject anything that comes from the light, darkness will rule over us and will eventually ruin us. So let us only choose to live in the light so that we will always be moved and directed by the Holy Spirit in everything we do. And it is only in that way that we experience heaven on earth.

For the days are coming upon you when your enemies will raise a palisade against you; they will encircle you and hem you in all sides. They will smash you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another within you because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus wept for us, because we just don't know what is there ahead of us and we are not prepared for it. Jesus said, &quot;If this day you only knew what makes for peace --but now it is hidden from your eyes...&quot; Jesus wants us to see beyond this life, to repent; to renew our ways and to always be ready for whatever challenges that may come our way. Let us reflect and realize that Jesus offered His life for our salvation, but it seems that we just forget all that He has done for us and ignore all that He is doing for us. We have set aside the most essentials in life and that is to seek Him and be united with Him through others. Sometimes we are misled, because we do everything to seek Him and to be with Him, yet we ignore His presence in every person we met each day. We hear Mass yet we are not prepared for it, for we are not on speaking terms with our neighbors. We go to Mass with anger, hatred and resentments in our hearts. That is why Jesus continues to weep for us and calling on us for conversion, yet we just ignored Him. We cannot go directly to Jesus without meeting Him along the way through others. We should not expect that our enemies to forgive us and will be nice to us, but forgiveness, understanding and a smile should first come from us. When we offer a smile even though our heart is breaking, to those who wronged us, it is not making a facade or being untrue, it is offering a sacrifice by suppressing our own feelings in order to do what God wants us to do. Let us pray the prayer for unity...&quot;Father of mercy, unite your sheep and bring them together again. Let them realize their aridity (dryness). Forgive them. Mold them into what you desire them to be. Remind them of Your ways. May all glory be in Your Holy Name, Forever and Ever. Amen.&quot;

Now there were seven brothers; the first married a woman but died childless. Then the second and the third married her, and likewise all the seven died childless. Finally the woman also died. Now at all the resurrection whose wife will that woman be? For all seven had been married to her.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;The children of this age marry and remarry; but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. They can no longer die, for they are like angels; and they are the children of God because they are the ones who will rise. That the dead will rise even Moses made known in the passage about the bush, when he called 'Lord' the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.&quot; Some of the scribes said in reply, &quot;Teacher, you have answered well.' And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.
<br /><br />Death in not the conclusion or the end of life, but it is entering into a new dimension of life eternal. It is a state of life where in we can live forever with God. And our only ID to heaven is our &quot;Intense Desire to be with God.&quot; If we pray and reflect on the apostles creed, we should believe what we have witnessed and live what we believe. Jesus wants us to realize that in heaven there are no more issues to tackle, all that is in heaven is complete praising and rejoicing together with the angels and saints and all of us will be angels ourselves. Although the feeling is still there but in a different dimension. No more sorrows and pain. That is why we cannot enter heaven's gate if we are found even the smallest stain of sin in us. Purgatory is the place where we are purified and sanctified. And it is a bonus on our part if while here on earth we already experience purification through our pains and sufferings while still living on earth, in reparation for our sins. We should look beyond this life and do what God wills for us, so that God will find our life worthy of resurrection. We should cultivate our faith, strong enough to sustain us in order for us to survive the afterlife. &quot;In whatever you do, remember your last day and you will never sin. (Sirach 7:36)&quot; &quot;On the other hand, the Lord says, that he who keeps before his eyes the truths of faith that is, death, judgement and the happy and unhappy eternity that awaits him shall never fall into sin.&quot; Prayer in our only strength and the only way wherein the Lord speaks to us and enlightens us, to show us the way to salvation. Let us reflect and ask ourselves if we are worthy of resurrection and make it as our immediate concern.

And He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. Then the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, a stranger and you welcomed Me, naked and you clothed Me, ill and you cared for Me, in prison and you visited Me.' Then the righteous will answer Him and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give You drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and clothe You? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you? And the King will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me. Then he will say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink, a stranger and you gave Me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and prison, and you did not care for me.' Then they will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison and not minister to your needs? He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.' And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus said: &quot;Whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.&quot; The pre-requisites to entering heaven's gate are not the great achievements we have attained in life or the treasures we possess in this lifetime, rather these are the smallest things we have heartily done to the least of our brothers. It is said that heaven's gate will be guarded not by Saint Peter but by the poor whom we frequently met each day in this lifetime, they will be the ones who will let in only those whom they recognized, who have helped them. Jesus is only requiring us to do simple things to the least of our brothers. The question will no longer be what we believe in, what are our greatest accomplishments in life or what are we bringing in? The question is made simpler: What have you done for these least of My brothers? It is not the question of the actions we have done, for we might have done charity, we have donated much and we have given much of our time. But a question, Where was our heart? How did we live our life? Do we truly care and are we truly concerned? Let us reflect on two things and ask ourselves, Did you find joy in your life? And is your life a joy to others? All these boils down to the second great commandment which is to &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; There are so many unfortunate people and children who are asking our help, yet we just ignore them and worst tell them hurting words. Let us take this as an opportunity for us to help them while in the same way we are helping ourselves in banking heavenly treasures. If we have nothing to give, let us not drive them away by hurting them. Always remember that the things that will remain forever with us, are the things that we share. There is no person who is so poor that has nothing to give and there is no person who is so rich that is not in need. Let us help one another and remind one another, so that in the end, we will all be one with God.

He said, &quot;I tell you truly, this poor widow put it more than all the rest; for those others have all made offerings from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole livelihood.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus wants us to realize that what matters most is not the act of giving itself nor the value or how much we have given, but what is most important to God is the attitude of giving. When we give but we kept on nagging and complaining, it doesn't count at all. And when we give and we make it a point that it is being acknowledged, then we already received the reward. In giving, it is not the value that counts but the willingness of the person to give. No Ifs and No Buts! God appreciates more the gifts that are given out of our nothingness. That is to share even the least that we have. There is no person so poor that has nothing to give and there is no person so rich that is not in need. Real gifts are those that come from the heart: time, care, compassion, faith, trust, love. And real giving only takes place when it no longer hurts when we give because giving now comes so easily and naturally from us. We should give the substance of what we have and not the surplus and most of all give without expecting something in return. Yet even without the expectation and the desire of receiving something in return, we also cannot deny the fact that when we give, we also receive countless blessings and graces from God. And that is how God's Magnificent Providence takes place. If we only realize this, then it will be so easy and natural for us to give. Because we believe that God provided and entrusted us all these for He sees in us, the pure intentions of our hearts and He knows very well that these blessings and graces will not be withheld and abused, but rather these will be properly shared and used. When we have more blessings, more is also expected of us but it also doesn't follow that if we have less, we have no responsibility of sharing the least that we have. Always remember that the things that remain in us are the things that we have shared.

Then they asked him, &quot;Teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to happen?&quot; He answered, &quot;See that you not be deceived, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he.' and 'The time has come/' Do not follow them! When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for such things must happen first, but it will not immediately be the end.&quot; Then He said to them, &quot;Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be powerful earthquakes, famines, and plagues from place to place; and awesome sights and mighty signs will come from the sky.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus is reminding us that we are not permanent settlers here on earth and that everything else here will vanish. We are always seeking for signs of the end of time, but we panic and worry if we see signs like these. But do we realize that end of time may not come as what we expected it to happen? But we all know that it will surely come and it may come anytime and one thing for sure is our natural end, which is our death. We fear of death for we are not prepared, we are afraid to face it because our spirit is weak, we do not want to think about it because it hurts us thinking that we will miss everyone and we will leave behind all our hard-earned material possessions. Yet, Do you think you will live and be remembered forever? Do you believe that what you have accomplished and acquired will outlive you? It has been said that there are three things to be done in order to be remembered forever: first, is to plant a tree. But what if in the future your family will cut them for it has already become an obstruction in their times. Second, is to write a book. But in this time an age only few are reading good books and they belong to your generation. Third, is to have a Son, who brings your name. But what if you have not done your best part in bringing him up and all he has learned is to despise you and hate you? We all want to live long, but we forget the essentials and the substance of living life. We hold on to the things that don't even last our lifetime. If we want to live forever, let us change the way we look at life and to look beyond this life. And only in this way we can hold on to the real, accurate and lasting things and that even after we have long been gone, it will remain with us for eternity, and these are LOVE, FAITH and CHARITY.

It will lead to your giving testimony. Remember, you are not to prepare your defense beforehand, for I myself shall give you a wisdom in speaking that all your adversaries will be powerless to resist or refute. You will even be handed over by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death. You will be hated by all because of My Name. but not a hair on your head will be destroyed. By you perseverance you will secure your lives.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus is telling us that it is through our perseverance that we will secure our lives. Perseverance should embrace all other virtues and values, for what are all those good traits and attitude if we do not persevere to the end. Because all the things we have achieved are the fruits of being able to persevere! And only through perseverance that we achieve them. Our great achievements in life are bought with great pain and perseverance. &quot;No guts, no glory! No pain, no gain! No cross, no resurrection! And all these are translated into one word: PERSEVERANCE.&quot; We can only get there if we persevere! And in order for us to persevere to the end, let us reflect on Mother Mary's Full Confidence with God and this is manifested by Her in 3 ways: first, through Her Fiat &quot;An enlightened YES!&quot; She asked the right question and she was given the right answer to Her question. If we ask God the right questions, we are on a sure way of finding the right answers. Second, It is manifested by Her maintained disposition. She was filled with nothing but gratitude and joy. And the sign of no Joy in any state of life is anger. There should always be joy in fulfilling God's will. If we are happy in doing God's will then we should be thankful for it. Third, It is manifested at the foot of the cross. Mother Mary persevered and suffered with joy and willingness. Are we willing to stand at the foot of the cross? Even if everybody is against us? Mother Mary persevered because She remained in God's Grace with joy and confidence in Her heart.

Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains. Let those within the city escape from it, and let those in the countryside not enter the city, for these days are the time of punishment when all the scriptures are fulfilled. Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days, for a terrible calamity will come upon the earth and wrathful judgement upon this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken as captives to all the Gentiles; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on earth nations will be in dismay, perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves. People will die of fright in anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. But when these signs begin to happen, stand erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus wants us to live by faith. In our days, is it already very difficult for us to see the signs of times for we are abusing and misusing nature. When calamities arrive, we can not say that these are the real signs that God is giving us as a warning for all of us, so that we will know that He is coming, for Mother Earth is getting back at us. All theses calamities and tragedies happen because we made them happen. So let us take care of what is left with us now and make necessary correction of the things that can still be corrected and prevented from further damage, like the cutting of trees and reclaiming water sheds and converting them into land areas. If we cannot change what has already been done, let us correct them by not doing them again and again. We should always learn from our mistakes. Let us not be complacent that anyway God will understand and forgive us. Yes, God always forgives but because He is a just God, even though our sins are forgiven, we always suffer the consequence that comes along with it. If we will remain faithful to God, we will be spared from all these turbulence and destruction. Yet Jesus is assuring all of us that if we remain in His Grace, we can stand erect and raise our heads a midst all these, for we believe that Jesus is our redemption. But if we are not prepared, we will just die of fright in anticipation of what is about to come upon the world. So while waiting for that day to come, let us be strengthened with our prayers and we should be always faithful, even to the point of death, for God will judge us according to how we responded to His call.

When their buds burst open, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near, in the same way, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus is telling us the lessons in life are not just learned from books, teachings or sayings, but we learn the greatest lessons are learned if we listen to His Words and make it a way of living. &quot;Heaven and earth will pass away but my words will not pass away.&quot; If we only follow God's Words, then we will never go wrong. It has been said that the best teacher is experience, because we learn our lessons the hard way. For if we always do our own will, most probably we end up frustrated. It is because we are not open and we do not submit ourselves to the will of God, that is why we make our lives and live our lives by trial and error kind of living. Our bad experience comes from bad decisions in life. The wise learn from the mistakes of others, while the hard heads learn from their own mistakes and the foolish learn nothing at all and continue to commit the same mistakes over and over again. Learn your lessons and share what you've learned! Like Mother Mary, we should be humble in responding to God's call; we should live life with contentment and to never complain anything that may come our way, rather we should offer them to God; And most of all we should always have the courage to take risks and to have the audacity to proclaim the Gospel. And to always do these for the good of others. To take the risk is our obedience to the will of God. All the lessons in life are already laid down for us, all we need to do is to receive them and make them a way of living.

For that day will assault everyone who lives on the face of the earth. Be vigilant at all times and pray that you have the strength to escape the tribulations that are imminent and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus wants us to be free from anxieties of daily life. And that is by trusting Him and entrusting everything to His care and leaving nothing for us to be worried about. Our daily concerns and struggles can drown and stifle us. Trying to make both ends meet, from rearing the kids, doing the household chores, beating deadlines or meeting other peoples expectations, all these add to our daily anxieties. &quot;Cast your care upon the Lord&quot; (Ps 55:23) We are never alone when we face the unknown, just do the best that you can and entrust everything to God's care. And let God do the rest. We can only do so much but let us realize that everything is in the hands of God. If we only learn to do these, we will never get exhausted and tired, for in God's hands we are assured and secured. All we need to do is to pray and to never cease praying. For it is in our prayer that we will learn to discern and discover that in everything we do God manifest himself, and so we should hear Him and be vigilant enough to discern His will for us. And we can hear Him through others, most especially those whom we encounter daily, and they are our family and friends; we also hear Him speak through our experiences; through our prayers and meditations. And always remember that God is so near to those who call Him and seek Him.

If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan is risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand; that is the end of him. But no one can enter a strong man's house to plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house. Amen, I say to you, all sins and all blasphemes that people utter will be forgiven them. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never have forgiveness, but is guilty of an everlasting sin.&quot; For they had said, &quot;He has an unclean spirit.&quot;
<br /><br />It is faith that make us believe that Jesus is God. For we have not seen Him nor be with Him. And without faith, we will keep on questioning everything that happens to us and maybe blaming God for making it happen. Even among ourselves we will never know and truly understand one another if we don't learn how to trust that there is goodness in each one of us. For if we keep on looking for sincerity and truthfulness of a person, we will just end up disappointed. We have to have that trust, for no one knows truly what lies behind the person's mind and what is buried deep within his heart but God alone. And so if we don't have faith and trust, we will end up fault finding. Yes we can say that Satan can play tricks by rising up against himself to make us believe that it is he whom we should believe in. But Jesus is assuring us that no one can stand if he himself is destroying his own self. Jesus is showing us that in order to drive out a strong force, the one who drives it out must be stronger than it. How can a family remain strong if the head is weak and the members are divided? How can we give in to marriage if we don't trust any person for that matter? How can we give others a chance to change if we have decided that there in no more hope for them to change and that there no goodness left in that person. Jesus assures us that all sins and blasphemes that people utter will be forgiven but once we do not trust and believe that our sin can be forgiven, then how can we be forgiven? We have to have faith and we have to show repentance and we have to renew our ways and believe that God is a loving, understanding and compassionate God, who forgives us and deliver us from evil. Jesus loves the sinner but hates the sin. And without His help, we can never do this for we hate sin and the sinner as well. Let us learn from Jesus on how to put compassion in our crusades, love in our fists, and heart in our fights. Jesus can identify the wrong and the wronged. He holds the bedeviled and drives away the demon. And in order for us to be able to see the difference is to define our actions. Because when we get used to committing the same mistakes again and again, we can no longer differentiate good from bad? The tendency is that, if many are doing it, then we would think that it must be the good thing to follow. We have to pray, discern and act on the promptings of the Holy Spirit in us so that we will never go wrong and we will be prevented from doing wrong. With our limitations, we can never understand God's plan for us, so we need to plunged into faith and believe in God's faithfulness and compassion, and we will be saved.
