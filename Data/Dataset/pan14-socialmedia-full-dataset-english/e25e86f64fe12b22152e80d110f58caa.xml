		<document id="68ce8831aed809bb83ca15a4d1f2128" url=""><![CDATA[Cash Honeymoon Registry: Going Beyond Traditional Gifts<br/><br/>A honeymoon registry has been used by many couples since the 1990’s. From a traditional web page, a honeymoon registry has evolved over the years to provide couples with more practical options when it comes to listing the gifts they want on their honeymoon.
<br /><br />Today, couples who prefer a trip of a lifetime over traditional gifts like chinaware and house ware can opt to create a honeymoon registry with a cash gift registry concept over a traditional <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZ3JlYXRhZmZhaXIuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3dlZGRpbmdfcmVnaXN0cnk_" target="_blank">wedding registry</a> or bridal registry. 
<br /><br /><strong>What is a cash honeymoon registry?</strong>
<br /><br />A cash honeymoon registry works like any ordinary honeymoon registries. But instead of listing only traditional items, a cash honeymoon registry allows couples to register non-traditional items. They can opt to list for a romantic cruise, a vacation in an exotic island, a scuba diving trip or any honeymoon ideas they have in mind. 
<br /><br />The cash honeymoon registry site will then break down the honeymoon trip into gift segments. These will cover the trip’s airfare, accommodation, the couple’s activities, meals and other expenses that the couple might incur during the trip. 
<br /><br />The couple, together with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZ3JlYXRhZmZhaXIuY29tL3BhZ2VzL2hvbmV5bW9vbl9yZWdpc3RyeQ__" target="_blank">honeymoon registry</a> site, could then invite guests, family and friends to view the web page and afterwards have the opportunity to choose what gift segment to fund that is light on their pocket.
<br /><br /><strong>Advantages of having a Cash Honeymoon Registry  </strong>
<br /><br />Instead of receiving multiples of the same gifts, with the cash honeymoon registry, couples have the opportunity to list beyond traditional gifts. And a honeymoon registry can also provide the couple’s guests with a simple online-purchasing process instead of searching for gifts in crowded department stores.
<br /><br />The cash honeymoon registry also takes out the guesswork in gift buying and makes the whole gift giving a more enjoyable, memorable and personalized experience.

<br /><br />A honeymoon registry has proven to serve as an alternative and contemporary way for couples to ask for gifts of their choice.
<br /><br />Like its counterparts in AGreatAffair’s <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZ3JlYXRhZmZhaXIuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3dlZGRpbmdfcmVnaXN0cnk_" target="_blank">wedding registry</a>    and bridal registry, the honeymoon registry can showcase its reasons why using a cash registry has advantages over any traditional gift registry. 
<br /><br />First, couples were not limited to a single retailer’s selection or price and can register for other stuff that was not in the honeymoon bridal registry list. 
<br /><br />Thus, couples were allowed to register for anything like a honeymoon dream vacation, a down payment for a new house, etc. 
<br /><br />Second, couples were able to register for any items they needed or wanted, expensive or not, which their guests could purchase in increments. 
<br /><br />In contrast with the traditional gift registry, AGreatAffair allowed couples to break down the price of each gift item, particularly those that were a bit costly, into smaller increments. 
<br /><br />For instance, if the couple wanted a $3,000 wide screen LCD TV they had been eyeing, guests can purchase it with increments amounting to $50 each person. Thus, purchasing had become a gift sharing experience among several guests without any coordination made by them.
<br /><br />Lastly, AGreatAffair Honeymoon registry allowed couples to ask for cash or other gifts in a polite and graceful way, and personalized the experience for their friends and family. 
<br /><br />AGreatAffair made the experience an elegant and personal one by enabling their guests to give precise gifts for couples. 
<br /><br />AGreatAffair honeymoon registry made the whole process more meaningful than just buying from traditional gift registries.

Not only can you list for traditional items, but you can also register the gifts you want to receive on your special occasion. 
<br /><br />Whether you want a vacation in Egypt, a weekend in Hawaii or an Asian cruise, a honeymoon registry with a cash gift registry concept can help you make those dreams come true. 
<br /><br />So to help you create one, here are the Top Tips in Creating a Cash Honeymoon Registry:
<br /><br /><strong>Visit Honeymoon Registry Sites</strong>
<br /><br />You can find a handful of cash <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hZ3JlYXRhZmZhaXIuY29tL3BhZ2VzL2hvbmV5bW9vbl9yZWdpc3RyeQ__" target="_blank">honeymoon registry</a>   sites. Before signing for one, see what the site has to offer. Make sure that the site is easy to use and navigate. Also, read their terms and conditions and see how their payout works.
<br /><br /><strong>Decide What Type of Honeymoon You Want and Where to Spend It</strong>
<br /><br />Of course you might have the perfect honeymoon in your mind that you want to register in your cash honeymoon registry. But do not go overboard. Be considerate of your guests too! Make sure that the trip will not cost them their savings. And remember, you also have to pay the balance so you and your hubby can take the trip. Therefore, pick a honeymoon that is both memorable and easy on the pocket. 
<br /><strong>
<br />Invite your Guests to View your Web Page Personally</strong>
<br /><br />Notify your guests about your cash honeymoon registry a month before or at least 2 weeks before your wedding. This will give them enough time to raise the funds they need to cover the trip. Also, invite them to visit your honeymoon registry personally as it is quite rude to include your gift preferences in your wedding invitation.
