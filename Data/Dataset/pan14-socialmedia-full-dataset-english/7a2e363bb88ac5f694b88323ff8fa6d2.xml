It relates to polymer chemistry, polymer physics, interface theory, plastic machinery, plastic processing molds, formulation of layout ideas and procedure command. The plastic polymer materials change into 3 physical state specifically glassy, large elastic state and viscous movement state when heated under consistent stress. 
<br /><br />Extrusion procedure manage parameters include things like temperature handle, functioning pressure in the plastic extruder, screw speed, extrusion speed and traction velocity, feed pace and cooling stereotypes.
<br /><br />1. Temperature control
<br /><br />Extrusion temperature is really a needed ailment for your molding stuff plasticization and plastics melt flow. It has an indispensable effect on the standard and yield with the material plasticization. Concept temperature window of plastic extrusion is involving the viscous movement temperature along with the degradation temperature. Polyolefin provides a broad temperature vary which is between the melting stage and 280?. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5leHRydWRlcndvcmxkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3Nqc3otc2VyaWVzLWNvbmljYWwtZG91YmxlLXNjcmV3LWV4dHJ1ZGVyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Conical double screw extruder</a> truly is important to find out about the bearing temperature of your processed materials and its bodily attributes with the appropriate charge of extrusion temperature.
<br /><br />two. Strain management
<br /><br />The most important stress parameter in the extrusion course of action is melt strain. In general, the rise of melt stress will reduce the plastic extruder output as well as the grow density of the products might help to boost the quality of items. However, excessive stress will bring safety issues. Melt stress has a shut connection together with the materials attributes, screw construction, screw velocity, temperature, filter mesh, perforated plate and several other factors. The melt strain is always managed in 10-30Ma.
<br /><br />three. Vacuum stereotypes
<br /><br />Vacuum stereotypes generally regulate two parameters of vacuum degree and cooling rate. More often than not, the vacuum diploma should really be reduced up to doable on the premise of meeting the appearance good quality of pipe. In this way, the inner stress within the pipe is minimized as well as pipe is hard to be deformed.
<br /><br />four. Cooling
<br /><br />The needs of cooling h2o from the polyethylene pipe extrusion are lower. The temperature is in most cases beneath 20?.The 1st section temperature may be somewhat bigger and your second section may be a little decrease as a way to type a temperature gradient. It's also quite important to regulate the cooling drinking water flow.
<br /><br />5. Screw pace and extrusion pace
<br /><br />The screw speed of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5leHRydWRlcndvcmxkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3NqLXNlcmllcy1vZi1zaW5nbGUtc2NyZXctZXh0cnVkZXIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">single screw extruder</a> is a vital parameter in managing the extrusion rate, yield and the excellent with the products. The rise of extruder velocity can raise the boost output. The greater shear amount will help to minimize the melt obvious viscosity which can be helpful to the homogenization from the substance.

According to the data estimates, the condensing temperature decreasing by 1 ?, the cooling capacity of unit power consumption reduction of about 3% -4%. Therefore, to ensure the cooling water circulating in a certain range, refrigeration unit cooling efficiency to prevent attenuation of the main measures.
<br /><br />I. the cooling water cycle water quality analysis
<br /><br />Air conditioning cooling water system is divided into two kinds of open and closed circulatory system, while the open-cycle cooling water system to good effect, low cost and widely used in engineering. However, in open systems in actual operation, cooling water through the evaporative cooling gradually concentrated, water Ca2 +, algae, suspended solids gradually increased, the wind and insolation, air, dust, debris, water soluble gas pollution that is generated major changes, resulting in system scaling, corrosion and microbial growth and large population, the system resistance increases, the heat exchange rate lower, equipment corrosion and shortened life expectancy, it should pay attention to the cooling water cycle water treatment.
<br /><br />Two. Circulating cooling water quality indicators
<br /><br />Air conditioning cooling water in the cycle can be summarized to produce suspended solids, fouling, corrosion and algae produce several aspects, to make the refrigeration unit in a certain cooling water under normal operating conditions, need water to remove suspended solids, control sludge, scale and corrosion of microbial growth.
<br /><br />Three. Large cooling <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51dmNzdGVyaWxpemVyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2xhc2VyLWFuaW9uLXNtYXJ0LXdhdGVyLXRyZWF0bWVudC1lcXVpcG1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">water treatment system</a><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51dmNzdGVyaWxpemVyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L21hZ25ldGljLXdhdGVyLXRyZWF0bWVudC1kZXZpY2VzLXBkLWN3Y3MtMDA2Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">magnetic water treatment</a>
<br />Cooling water treatment methods of water treatment system can be divided into chemical and physical methods, the current situation, large cooling water system to use more chemical methods, which includes water treatment systems, dosing systems, cleaning systems and backwash system. Add water by ion-exchange system to remove hardness and salts added to the water cycle with detergents, corrosion inhibitors and biocide, and regularly cleaning the system and backwash, the formation of a full range of water treatment technology. This method works well, extend equipment life, high efficiency, energy conservation, domestic and foreign companies are concerned about the large-scale air-conditioning cooling water treatment system was gradually adopted a more promising future.
<br /><br />Inhibitors are commonly used in cleaning zinc sulfate, polyacrylic acid, maleic acid polymer, copolymer, etc. These items can be quickly dissolved in the water play equipment and systems for cleaning corrosion inhibition, but their application features, suitable temperature, the concentration of dosing, PH value in water control and the resultant greater differences should therefore be based on local water conditions and operation of a reasonable choice. There are a variety of fungicides, such as sodium hypochlorite, chlorine, ozone, clean and off and so on. But the most commonly used is bactericidal effect, with detergents, corrosion inhibitors used in conjunction with inexpensive chlorine, chlorine to ensure the best killing effect, should be noted:
<br /><br />(1) For open cooling water system, cooling tower chlorination Walter pipeline should be 200mm below the surface pool the following, non-chlorinated water in the back.
<br /><br />(2) should be used for large continuous chlorination system means the system should be used for small and medium batch chlorination method, chlorination time interval 2 ~ 3h.
<br /><br />(3) chlorination, the PH value of recycled water should be 7 to 8; should avoid adding both copper corrosion inhibitor; sludge in the cooling tower basin to be immediately removed.
<br /><br />Four <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51dmNzdGVyaWxpemVyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L21hZ25ldGljLXdhdGVyLXRyZWF0bWVudC1kZXZpY2VzLXBkLWN3Y3MtMDA2Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">magnetic water treatment</a>
<br />Electronic water with a simple installation, Anti-fouling significantly, biocide, does not pollute the environment, the characteristics of low operating costs, which are widely used in small air-conditioning cooling water system, the choice should pay attention to:
<br /><br />(1) The total hardness of water should be &lt;700mg / l (as CaCO3) and apply produce carbonic acid, salt, dirt like water quality, water is the main component of silicate scale should not use.
<br /><br />(2) electronic water must be mounted vertically, the next inlet, outlet on its high-frequency generator is mounted at distances greater than 20kW electrical equipment, if the issues can not meet the limited space distance should be set shield and a good grounding.
<br /><br />(3) the use of the process requiring regular sewage, electrode cleaning 2-4 times a year, with five years must be re-spray the surface protective film can be used; electronic water feature should be no additional anti-corrosion preservative.

At most 3700mL dimethyl ether will be dissolved in every 100mL of water, and it may also be easily dissolved in many types of organic solvents such as gasoline, carbon tetrachloride, acetone, chlorobenzene, and methyl acetate. Quite often dimethyl ether is hard to be activated under room temperature. 
<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oZW5nbWFvbWFjaGluZXJ5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2NvMi1yZWNvdmVyeS1wbGFudC5odG1s" target="_blank">CO2 recovery plant</a> technology used to produce dimethyl ether can also be called two-step approach, which focuses mainly on the transformation of synthesis gas (consisting of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into methanol. With copper-based catalyst as a kind of acid catalyst, dimethyl ether will be created from the methanol that has been separated and purified. Yet, the one-step method designed and developed recently combines the two steps mentioned above together and helps to make the two reactions happen in one reactor. Then, the products such as methanol generated in the very first step will be directly converted into dimethyl ether in situ without separation. Compared with two-step way, the one-step method features simple procedures and low costs. But the disadvantages can be seen in the fact that there will be abundant carbon dioxide emitted from the process and in the high investment for the 1st time. So there exists restriction in the applicable areas of industry. For now, the two-step method is often taken in the production of the most of dimethyl ether in industrial production.
<br /><br />One-step process of synthesis gas used to produce dimethyl ether is gaining an increasing popularity recently, and it largely reduces the cost of production by emerging the two steps into one and shortening the production processes and reducing the frequent use of dimethyl ether plant.
<br /><br />Dimethyl ether is mainly used to replace liquefied petroleum gas to burn and then plays the role of automobile fuel in platform diesel. In addition, dimethyl ether can also serve as aerosol, freezing medium, vesicant, and industrial chemicals that play a fundamental role in the production of dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl carbonate, alkyl halide, etc.
<br /><br />Dimethyl ether as a sort of new and clean energy and a role of supplement of traditional energy can be used to replace gasoline, diesel, liquefied gas, natural gas, etc. The merit in the replacement of liquefied gas can be seen in advantageous price. Therefore, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oZW5nbWFvbWFjaGluZXJ5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2h5ZHJvZ2VuLXBlcm94aWRlLXBsYW50Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">hydrogen peroxide equipment</a> will see a positive effect in reducing life burden with its low price of dimethyl ether.

The head part of the extruder is the main components of extruding plastic molding; it turns the molten plastic from an extruder by a spiral motion into linear motion, and further, to generate the necessary molding pressure, ensures the dense, so as to obtain the continuous section bar with the same section shape. The forming die usually adopts the cooling, pressure or vacuum suction method, stabilizes the shape of the plastic from the tip, and coining, in order to get plastic molding which has more accurate section and glossier surface.
<br /><br />The head part of the extruder can be classified by extruded plastic moldings, usually including plastic pipes, rods, plates, sheets, webs, monofilament, aggregates, various special-shaped material, blown film, wire, cable etc. According to the extruding direction of the product, it can be divided into straight head and lateral head. The direction of the material in the straight head aligns with the extruder's screw axis, such as hard tube head; but in the lateral head, material flow direction is at an angle to extruder's screw axis, such as cable head. According to the head pressure size classification can be divided into low pressure head (stream pressure less than 4MPa), middle pressure head (stream pressure 41OMPa) and high pressure head (material flow pressure is greater than 1OMPa).
<br /><br />The principles of extrusion head design including:
<br /><br />1. Streamline cavity. In order to make the plastic melt flow along the channel smoothly and successfully extruded, the head's cavity should be smoothly shaped, the surface roughness should be less than1.6-3.2&amp;mu;m.
<br /><br />2. Sufficient compression ratio. In order to make the products compacting and eliminated the seam resulting from divider brace, according to the different types of products and plastic, the extrusion head should be designed with adequate compression ratio.
<br /><br />3. Correct shapes and dimensions of the section. Because of the die swell effect caused by the plastic physical performance and pressure, temperature and other factors, and the shrinkage effect due to traction, which make the head of the molding section shape and size is not as same as required, so the design should make proper shape and dimension compensation to the tip, and reasonably determine the flow channel size, control the tip molding length, in order to get the right shape and size.
<br /><br />4. Rational selection of materials. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5leHRydWRlcndvcmxkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3B2Yy1jcHZjLXBsYXN0aWMtcGlwZS1leHRydXNpb24tbGluZS5odG1s" target="_blank">plastic pipe production machine</a> is great when the flow channel engages with the flowing plastic melt; in high temperature molding process, some of the plastics will produce chemical gas which will corrode the channel. So in order to improve the service life of the machine, the head materials should be selected for wear and corrosion resistance, high hardness of steel or alloy steel.

Treatment also features processing the resulting wastewater and sludge therapy and final disposal, therapy and occasionally exhaust emissions. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51dmNzdGVyaWxpemVyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2F1dG9tYXRpYy1zZWxmLWNsZWFuaW5nLWZpbHRlci1jb250cm9sLWJveC1zZXBhcmF0ZS5odG1s" target="_blank">Self cleaning filter</a> solution ways is usually summarized in 3 strategies: ? The most common is by means of the elimination of aspect or all the impurities in uncooked water to acquire the needed water quality; ? within the raw water by adding new factors to get the expected h2o top quality; ? in the uncooked drinking water processing would not contain adding new elements to get rid of impurities or challenges. 
<br /><br />Impurities and contaminants, like water treatment solution combine of coarse product, suspended solids, colloids and solutes. Coarse product for example plants floating within the river, garbage, substantial aquatic organisms, waste materials water and large dust along with grit. Water supply project, the coarse impurities in the drinking water intake constructions, amenities, removing, treatment solution is not really included in the scope.
<br /><br />Wastewater remedy to eliminate coarse impurities are more often than not part with the water pretreatment. Suspended solids and colloids, which include sediment, algae, bacteria, viruses, and also the present drinking water cure approach and the resulting insoluble substances. Solutes are inorganic salts, organic ingredients and gases. Treatment to eliminate impurities in the h2o, the leading scope of the system can be around divided as per dimensions of impurities. As the impurities contained in raw h2o and completed drinking water may be allowed over the variety and focus of impurities in exceptionally unique, the remedy process differs far and widely.
<br /><br />Regarding the domestic h2o, drinking water in the high-quality uncooked water, finished h2o is barely disinfected; through the first typical river or lake water, initially take out the turbidity a result of sediment and also of impurities, after which disinfected; more polluting uncooked drinking water , should take away natural make any difference along with pollutants; comprising iron and manganese in raw water, the need to take out iron and manganese. Domestic drinking water superior to fulfill the general necessities of industrial drinking water, industrial drinking water, but at times the need to have for even more processing, like softening, desalination etcetera.
<br /><br />Once the effluent discharge or reuse h2o quality demands are reduced, just use approaches for instance screening and sedimentation to remove coarse impurities and suspended solids (usually known as principal cure); When requested to remove organic issue, more often than not inside the key treatment solution used after biological treatment solution (normally named secondary treatment solution) and disinfection; right after biological treatment solution of wastewater, the method completed collectively referred to tertiary treatment method or advanced cure, just like in the event the waste drinking water discharged in the must prevent eutrophication of water bodies for elimination of nitrogen and phosphorus which can be tertiary therapy practice. If the wastewater for a h2o resource, the product h2o high quality prerequisites as well as the corresponding manufacturing processes with its makes use of. Theoretically, the cutting-edge water treatment solution technology, the process could be obtained from any poor-quality water of any quality completed water.
<br /><br />Approach to classification of h2o remedy approach, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51dmNzdGVyaWxpemVyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L2hpZ2gtZmxvdy1zdGFpbmxlc3Mtc3RlZWwtYmFnLWZpbHRlci5odG1s" target="_blank">bag filter</a> is in fact unique and completed h2o top quality layout gap, the raw drinking water must remain taken on the processing methods. Each individual approach about the raw water to supply a bodily, chemical or microbiological effects. A method is generally concluded in a processing device, but in addition there are numerous processing tools to finish practice. A course of action or a mix of some processes can kind a water cure unit approaches, just like coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection is considered the most commonly used means for water therapy unit.

It relates to polymer chemistry, polymer physics, interface concept, plastic machinery, plastic processing molds, formulation of design principles and approach management. The plastic polymer elements change into three physical state specifically glassy, higher elastic state and viscous move state when heated underneath regular strain. 
<br /><br />Extrusion approach regulate parameters consist of temperature command, functioning strain in the plastic extruder, screw pace, extrusion velocity and traction velocity, feed speed and cooling stereotypes.
<br /><br />one. Temperature regulate
<br /><br />Extrusion temperature is actually a vital condition for your molding substance plasticization and plastics melt move. It has a key influence on the standard and generate of your stuff plasticization. Idea temperature window of plastic extrusion is among the viscous stream temperature and the degradation temperature. Polyolefin has a vast temperature variety which can be amongst the melting level and 280?. It can be necessary to know about the bearing temperature in the processed product and its physical properties with the correct control of extrusion temperature.
<br /><br />two. Strain command
<br /><br />The key pressure parameter within the extrusion process is melt stress. Generally, the rise of melt pressure will reduce the plastic extruder output as well as grow density of the products can help to improve the standard of goods. Nevertheless, extreme pressure will bring safety complications. Melt strain provides a close relationship with the content homes, screw construction, screw speed, temperature, filter mesh, perforated plate and several other variables. The melt stress is usually controlled in 10-30Ma.
<br /><br />three. Vacuum stereotypes
<br /><br />Vacuum stereotypes generally command two parameters of vacuum diploma and cooling amount. More often than not, the vacuum diploma will need to be minimized up to feasible within the premise of meeting the looks top quality of pipe. In this manner, the internal stress in the pipe is reduced and also the pipe is hard to become deformed.
<br /><br />four. Cooling
<br /><br />The specifications of cooling water from the polyethylene <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5leHRydWRlcndvcmxkLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0L3BwLXBlLWFicy1wcy1oaXBzLXBsYXN0aWMtc2hlZXQtZXh0cnVzaW9uLWxpbmUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">plastic sheet extrusion machine</a> are very low. The temperature is typically beneath 20?.The 1st section temperature may be rather bigger and the 2nd area might be a bit lower in order to type a temperature gradient. It is also particularly significant to regulate the cooling drinking water flow.
<br /><br />5. Screw speed and extrusion velocity
<br /><br />The screw speed is an essential parameter in controlling the extrusion pace, generate and also the excellent on the items. The rise of extruder pace can boost enhance the output. The improved shear price will help to minimize the melt obvious viscosity which happens to be beneficial to the homogenization of the substance.
