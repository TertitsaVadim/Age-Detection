They are funny, too, but that is not the same issue. Fun to read is materials that is entertaining and effortless for readers, a superb standard for all writing.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;Lyrical&lt;/B&gt;<br /><br />Dr. Seuss' books are written in verse.

Good writing of all varieties is pleasing to the eye and ear.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;Economical&lt;/B&gt;<br /><br />Children have brief attention spans.

That's good guidance for all who compose copy because children are not the only ones with quick attention spans.<br /><br />&lt;B&gt;Memorable&lt;/B&gt;<br /><br />This really is the litmus check for all writing. Did readers take something away? Was their time effectively invested? &lt;I&gt;The Cat in the Hat&lt;/I&gt; is actually a story about possessingenjoyable, even on a rainy day.
