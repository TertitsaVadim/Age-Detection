<br /><br />Ebooks are interactive books as they need search capabilities; they are protected and have content in the form of graphics, videos, forms, links, and tags. They're not only for the purpose of information, but are increasingly being employed as a marketing tool. With the concept of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyYW5kZWRlYm9va3Muc2t5cm9jay5jb20vMjgwNTEzODI3Ny1CcmFuZGFibGUtRWJvb2tzLVRvLUdldC1XZWJzaXRlLVRyYWZmaWMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">viral marketing</a>  applied to ebooks, these have now become self expanding and will reach several users by just being giving away once. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Byb2ZpbGVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9ibG9nL0hMRjM0WjZIQUZTV1UyMlhZUzNUTU4zM0VRP2VpZD1hN1JpTFk0N24zbGlSOXhydUsyeDZ0TzJzT29BRjBFSnN0VkJjRkdybjNaanlLT01fZw__" target="_blank">Branded Ebooks</a>  will also be used to advertise products or services and web pages, either one’s own or someone else’s.   
<br /><br />To be able to download ebooks, it's necessary that the user has the specified reader that is able to make the download easy and the ebook readable. Most of the ebooks are also written as PDF files. Therefore to download a .PDF ebook, the user should have the Adobe Reader put in on his computer. The publisher may have given the ebook by anyone of 3 ways-that's, as a download on a web page, as a link in an email, or as an attachment in an email. To download ebooks by any of these methods, here are the rules in short:
<br /><br /><strong>Web page downloads</strong>
<br /><br />This is a straightforward means through which ebooks can be easily downloaded. When the ebook is purchased, the publisher directs the user to a web page that displays a .PDF link. The webpage might urge the user to start the download by clicking on the graphic icon depicting the same. But instead of clicking, right clicking and saving the target or link, depending on the browser, the ebook is saved on the computer. 
<br /><br /><strong>Email links</strong>
<br /><br />The publisher might also send the ebook as a direct link in an email. This is kind of like opening and downloading the ebook as the web page downloading method. The difference is that the user accesses the ebook through his email account rather than the webpage directly.
<br /><br /><strong>Email attachment</strong>
<br /><br />There might be publishers who send their ebooks as an attachment in an email. But the issue with this methodology is that the spam filters prohibit the mail from reaching the user’s inbox. So the ebook might be within the filtered spam, and if it is not there, the publisher has to be contacted again. 
<br /><br />Therefore it's simple to download ebooks by any of these given methods. Once downloaded, the ebooks can be read repeatedly. With many of the ebooks being free to download, there is ample material for all to peruse.
