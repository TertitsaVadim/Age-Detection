Dr. Truman’s prognosis was devastating: “He has a 50-50 chance.” The countless clinic visits, the blood tests, the intravenous drugs, the fear and pain–the mother’s ordeal can be almost as bad as the child’s because she must stand by, unable to bear the pain herself. David never cried in the waiting room, and although his friends in the clinic had to hurt him and stick needles in him, he hustled in ahead of his mother with a smile, sure of the welcome he always got. When he was three, David had to have a spinal tap–a painful procedure at any age. It was explained to him that, because he was sick, Dr. Truman had to do something to make him better. “If it hurts, remember it’s because he loves you,” Deborah said. The procedure was horrendous. It took three nurses to hold David still, while he yelled and sobbed and struggled. When it was almost over, the tiny boy, soaked in sweat and tears, looked up at the doctor and gasped, “Thank you, Dr. Truman, for my hurting.” ~ 
<br /><br />Monica Dickens, Miracles of Courage, 1985.
<br /><br />Do we thank God for our testing? For our pains?
<br /><br />God not only knows everything that’s taking place in our lives, but he is also deeply touched when something bad happens to us. The Bible says that Christ was “a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering” (Isaiah 53:3).
<br /><br />But why does God feel this way when we’re going through hard times? The reason is because he loves us and cares about us. God isn’t indifferent to our hurts; He loves us! And just as you hurt when someone you love is hurting, so God — in a far greater way — is hurt when we are hurting.
<br /><br />But God not only loves us, he wants to help us and encourage us when hard times come. This is why we can turn to him in prayer, and trust every situation into his hands. Sometimes he answers our prayers by taking away the burden we’re carrying. But even if that doesn’t happen, he is still with us, and he’ll give us the strength we need to see us through the hard times. The Bible says, “Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you” (Psalm 55:22).
<br /><br />God tests us so we can experience victory. He walks in faith and believes we will win every  test. He is like a proud parent who tells their child to “Go out there and show them what you can do,” expecting them to win.
<br /><br />God allows us to enter into faith combat so we can see His deliverance and victory over our adversary. As we are faithful where we are (the test), God will give us a larger sphere of responsibility and His grace will always sustain us, no matter what.
<br /><br />2 Corinthians 12:7-12   Jesus says, “MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU, for MY STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT in  WEAKNESS”…Paul says—”Therefore I take Pleasure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Needs, in Persecutions, in Distresses, for Christ’s sake. For WHEN I AM WEAK, THEN I AM STRONG.”
<br /><br />Understanding the nature of God … “If it hurts, remember it’s because He loves you” … we can then say, thank you Jesus for our pain, for our hurts.. we offer them up at the foot of Your throne.

<br /><br />“You are precious and honored in my sight… because I love you” ~ Isaiah 43:4
<br /><br />~ You are mine…  it’s one of the most awesome promises in the Bible and is found in I43..Isaiah 43.
<br /><br />It  is one of the most beautiful and endearing words of assurance from God. It was addressed to the people of Israel but it might as well be to any of us who believe in him.
<br /><br />~ You are mine… when you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned.. For I am the Lord, your God.. you are precious and honored in my sight, and.. i love you…Isaiah 43:1-4
<br /><br />God says we are precious and honoured, and he loves us. 
<br /><br />YOU ARE LOVED BY GOD. No ifs, no buts… all cut &amp;amp; dry. You are loved by God… no more sugar coating, no more need to impress, no more add ons, and no one can top that!
<br /><br />Now why don’t you start believing it yourself… when God said that… no one can top that!
<br /><br />~ Every morning when you wake up… be refreshed and let your first thoughts be… God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ Every night as you lay in bed to sleep, end the day in echo… God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />Decide to live a life of knowing and believing the love of God… as you go on with your different lives, you’ll start understanding more and more deeply just how amazing God is… and how powerful those words are!
<br /><br />~ When you need someone to lean on in those times of trouble, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re tempted to give up, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re overwhelmed by all the stuff that you have to do, pause for awhile and remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re feeling down and helpless, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re sick, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re marriage is on rocks, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re tempted to sin, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re tempted to dishonor God, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re about to lash out in anger, in distress… remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re broke and you don’t have money to pay your bills, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re in fear, anxious and alone… remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />~ When you’re single and patiently waiting, remember God telling you, I love you.
<br /><br />…. and a lot more reasons to question life…bear in mind and always remember, God telling you, I love you.. God will always be with us even through difficult times…because He loves us.
<br /><br />Love is one of the attributes of God and an essential part of His nature. Our relationship to God is like the loving relationship between a child and parent. Like a loving parent, God knows and cares deeply for each of us… so why don’t we all rest in the loving arms of God and allow Him to walk with us through our dark times…

After years of wandering through this world..and searching for answers to our different questions in life, it’s simply amazing to know that God created us to do “good works w/c (He) prepared in advance for us… (Ephesians 2:10)… and this fires us up, gives us purpose.
<br /><br />That’s why whenever we’re faced with different challenges, we feel the drive to move up… step up…that’s why with the recent NBA finals the entire nation’s so in to it… As for the players view… sports can be so rewarding… Where there is one goal… and it is clearly defined… you play to win… And in winning… we earn rewards… and when we don’t… atleast know that our goal is to do better, to improve so that next time you’ll win! Plain &amp; simple!
<br /><br />But in life itself, as we go through our daily routines… a lot of us are still searching… seeking… and doesn’t have yet a clearly defined goal in life… or a purpose… and instead of feeling rewarded in life… we end up losing… down… empty and lost. I was once in that shoes… that’s why it’s great to know that God knows us…
<br /><br />~before I formed you in the womb, I knew you..(Jeremiah 1:5)
<br /><br />..that He’s not just doing some mismatch in our lives… and He’s not just checking on us all saying… “I think… he’ll be a good husband… looks like she’ll be a good entrepreneur… he sounds like he’d be a good leader…  an outstanding student”.. . nor He’s not just having some trial and error scenarios just because He thinks, or He looks at us like we do… Rather, He knows exactly what we’re made for. We are unique… special and we have a great destiny in Him. He created each and every one of us for a specific purpose! and the best way to discover what that purpose is, is to know God… and marvel in His beauty, His very nature… and the best way to know God is to read His word.
<br /><br />I pray that as we commit to knowing God and the purpose He has for us, we will be inspired to dig deeper into His Word… and pray that we will have a deeper intimacy with Him… and in the process, may we come to a greater understanding of who God is… and of God’s love for us… and His plans for our life…
<br /><br />One of my fave verses in the bible is (Jeremiah 29:11).. ~ “I know the plans I have for you.. plans to prosper you and not to harm you.. plans to give you hope and a future”
<br /><br />… but these words will just be plain words and will not be powerful if you don’t know who God really is… and what He’s capable of…
<br /><br />So what are you waiting for, be excited and schedule your personal time with God now… tap into the source of all wisdom… and “Know this… God said it! Believe it..claim it! and that settles it…”

I was just a mere expectator, Then came high school life, met few Christian friends who diligently invites me to their “gathering”..but still I didn’t put much attention into it.. I reasoned out, I wasn’t bad after all..instead I became active on one of the organizations called “Kabataang Lingkod ni Maria” and handled small groups to facilitate for worship, sharing, even prayers but I wasn’t changed. Time passed..and everything just became any other ordinary group for me..I still felt so empty. Many years of wandering.. I regularly “meet” with Christ on Sundays..then just hi..hello’s on Monday to Saturday..Funny it may seem..but it’s true.. I ignored Him a couple of times.. He may have reached out to me on many ways..different venues but I always turned my back on Him..feeling I do not need any of it because I know a lot of things and I’m okay..I’m in denial and i’m not in need..Then I made lots of friends, went into a relationship, turned into vices…I may be a leader at school but I have very low self esteem, coming from a broken family..I’m always insecure. I was misled that to be accepted I need to be like my friends, laugh like them, think like them &amp; live like them. Trying to fit into their world..i just enjoyed being a sinner…and yet I don’t feel bad after all..coz it’s just normal to be that way when they’re around. I nurtured the anger, the hurt..resentment inside me..I’ve been unforgiving to the people who caused me pain.. My father..my ex..friends who betrayed me..Many of them doesn’t met up with my expectations..and I felt all alone.. rejected..unloved. When I was given the gift of motherhood.. I asked, how will I be able to share a part of me when I myself is not whole? A couple of times I tried fixing things..making my life whole..i’ve got plans but I always failed..because everything I do..i’m doing it my way..Often, when “plan” is used in other translations it refers to human “schemes” rather than those of God..and im of no difference to that.. because I don’t know God and any of His plan for me.
<br /><br />Then on one season of my life, when I was at my lowest..God did not gave up on me.. He personally hand-picked me..He sent people to comfort me..to listen to me..to care for me.. I was invited to a church meeting and was delivered from sin. Everybody is singing..with glow on their faces..I was overjoyed because I had an encounter with Christ for the very first time..and my heart is open and I was set free..from bondage of sins..that held me back for a long time..for a chance to enjoy life and see the beauty of everything else that’s around me. My family..my precious baby..they all came into reality for me..for before they we’re just blurred pictures of obligations &amp; responsilbility.. But now..everything has a reason..a purpose..they we’re presented to me as gifts..as blessings..as someone that I am accountable to. But Christian life for me is not all fairy tale.. It is a indeed a process..every single day is a decision to make..a commitment to purity..to forgiveness..to love..to faith..to grace..to God.. but it isn’t hard then..because I have people who nurtures me with much love, with acceptance..giving me hope..inspiration..equipping me with tools to make it..my spiritual family. They not only believed on me..but we all believe on the same God who makes all things possible for us who believes.. I was reminded of an illustration that for my cup to be filled up..i need to be empty.. for I was holding on to something all my life..but I have to let go of it so that I can hold on to God..to Him alone..complete dependence on His will and never on mine. As Christians, we are like stage actors..when lights are all gone and we’re about to do our individual parts..we’re like on a black hole we don’t see whats beyond that black hole but we feel their presence, we know they’re out there… And that presence as our “audience” ..it motivates us, encourages us, inspires us to be the best that we can.. And before you knew it, the play is up..and the lights are on..we will see proud faces..hear the clap on their hands..and hear them say..”job well done!”
<br /><br />Hope you we’re all encouraged…He’s not yet through with us..so let’s just be excited of things to come..and looking forward to hear Him say ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! Matthew 25:23

She may be in a difficult situation right now, a problem as big as she can imagine, but God is indeed bigger than all our cares, all our concerns, all our problems. Struggles are part of our everyday life, since every moment of our time is said to be a battle to face, a decision to make. Our mind is the battleground of the enemy and we need to be always connected with God to be guarded always. We needed to forgive ourselves too so that there will be no condemnation. Even our family can fail us..but if we truly love the person and if we truly have the love of God, we will not wait until the person who caused us pain ask for our forgiveness..we would do so because we too would want to be set free.
<br /><br />“For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.” (Matthew 6:9-15)
<br />According to the Bible I must forgive others or the Father will not forgive me. Having an unforgiving heart blocks my prayers to be heard by God and I want to experience Him daily..then I must forgive.
<br />They say forgiveness is one of the most important issues we Christians can ever encounter..we are all sinners and we are separated from God because of our sin. Forgiveness is the heart of God’s plan for us..and it is our hope to be reunited with Him. We know this and would always share this to every people that we bring to a close encounter with God.
<br /><br />But how do we really begin to forgive someone who caused our family so much pain and turmoil?
<br />During my childhood days, I would resent my father for I am a battered child. I came from a broken family and didn’t experienced having a father in authority over my life. So growing up, I would always struggle in submission, in trust, in obedience and in love. God dealt with me in a loving way that He allowed me to go circumstances where I myself would need and ask for His forgiveness, in order for me to forgive. I cannot do it on my own..only by His grace..I am fortunate that God is a forgiving God. We must look to Him to help us forgive others.
<br /><br />God knows best. Jesus Christ sacrificed His Body and Blood for the sins of the world! That’s why God forgives. God forgave me because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. God forgave you because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. God forgave you and me because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ…and will constantly forgive whenever we ask for forgiveness. We don’t have to forgive others to receive God’s forgiveness. We already have it. We do not and cannot lose the forgiveness God has given us. We are under His grace and we just have to be obedient to His teachings.
<br /><br />“Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.”
<br />Colossians 3:13-14
<br /><br />“Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.”
<br />Ephesians 4:31-32
<br /><br />This is how and why we should forgive those who have wronged us..be it a new acquaintance, a friend, a family, your loved one, your leader. We can be easily offended by others at times but it’s difficult if you are harboring bitterness, rage and anger in your heart. God wants us to “get rid of all that” because He knows it will free us..free our heart and mind to truly worship and enjoy His presence. Forgiving others is one of the greatest examples of the reality of God’s Life in us. Forgiving others also frees us to know the fullness of God’s Love and Grace; to experience all that God has for us in this life.
<br /><br />So what are we waiting for..cry out to God to always have that forgiving heart and live a free man..
<br /><br />Mark 11:25
<br />And whenever you make a prayer,
<br />let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have
<br />anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness
<br />for your sins from your Father who is in heaven.

		<document id="256301b7b6aa2c564a52514976c13878" url=""><![CDATA[The Comforting Truth<br/><br/>As I read about Romans 8:28 I was reminded of God‘s comforting truths to us..
<br /><br />~ that the things we most resented can be turned by God as our greatest triumph..
<br />~ that He can take the least expected things in our life into something great according to His purpose
<br />~ that life is not a problem to be solved but a work to be made..
<br />~ because God knows what’s best for us and He wants to give that to you and me.
<br /><br />It is true because we know God and He has said it. His word is trustworthy and that guarantees His promise. Indeed, His character rests upon it. We know because we know Him. We know not by looking at the events of our life but by knowing our God..
<br /><br />We may ask.. Why is this? Why does God do things this way? We don’t know at this time. His thoughts are not our thoughts. We have only limited understanding of His methods and purposes. Later, we will understand it all, when He is ready for us to have this understanding.
<br />ISAIAH 55:8-9 (KJV)
<br />8
<br />For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your
<br />ways my ways, saith the LORD.
<br />9
<br />For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my
<br />ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
<br />thoughts.
<br /><br />rather, you can say, if you’re in a difficult time…
<br />” OK, God… please take away this frustrating situation and work through it for my good and your glory.”
<br /><br />Romans 8:28 has often been a word of hope for me, assuring me that all things, even “bad” things, “work out” for people who love God. When I’m worried and in fear, or my faith is tested.. I am reminded that God is in control and He will never fail.
<br /><br />Dr. Torrey always said that Romans 8:28 is a “soft pillow for a tired heart”. Or as someone else has said “God’s good
<br />promises put a rainbow of hope in every cloud and a “pillow of grace” in every bed of affliction!”
<br /><br />The comforting truth of Romans 8:28 is based especially on God’s sovereignty. If all things work together for good (all events, all circumstances, all trials, all happenings, every area of our life, etc.), then it follows that God must be over all things whatsoever and must control all things. He has power over all things. He gives whatever He chooses to whomever He pleases. Nothing exists or occurs without His permission. This is the wonderful fact that an all-wise, all-loving, just God is in complete control of all things!
<br /><br />So we can declare and rest in the fact that if we love God, and we are living in obedience to Him, He will grant us the desires of our hearts. And we can claim and declare that indeed, amidst any situation we may be in to…we can say to God… THAT IN ALL THINGS YOU WILL WORK FOR OUR GOOD BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU AND WE HAVE BEEN CALLED ACCORDING TO YOUR PURPOSE..giving glory unto your name.

		<document id="9edf89742e12cc625ab35c1850cfa411" url=""><![CDATA[Being Thankful<br/><br/>A lot of times, I thought of writing a blog but wasn’t sure on how and where to start.. I wasn’t really into writing..but I felt the need to give it a try and speak about life, friendships, of God‘s goodness, faithfulness, love, promises..His very nature…by opening up what’s in my heart..
<br /><br />And what a good way to start is… simply talk about how God moves in my life. Even on the simplest things.. there is an overflow of thanksgiving before the Lord.
<br /><br />Being thankful in times of trials..
<br /><br />When my daughter Nicole got sick last September 2010 and was hospitalized.. she was critical due to a rare strain of dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever stage3).. her platelet count went down to 15cc and she was in need of donors for 3 blood transfusions and we had a hard time looking for possible ones because of her rare blood type too. I was already panicking and I must admit..my faith was really put to test.. Things around us seemed so perfect.. things we’re all nice and we’re happy then suddenly I was in that position.. somehow I was caught off-guard. But then I was reminded, why waiver in faith?.. why doubt?.. I know my God.. and I just have to trust Him no matter what. A couple of times I prayed for sick people, laid my hands on them, asked for God’s healing.. for God’s favor… and now, it’s my daughter who needs her healing. He gave Nicole as a gift to us and I know that God has something good for her.. (Jeremiah 29:11) There we’re moments that I struggled.. especially when I get emotional.. but I know my God and I chose to be thankful amidst our situation. A couple of times my tears would just fall down and I need to cry in secret as Nicole asks me “is everything alright?” I know I need to be strong for her and make her feel secure.. that everything will turn out well.. that she’ll be okay and we’ll all go home.. because I know my God!
<br /><br />I’m in faith.. though at times I’m shaken.. I decided to pray and worship the Lord all the more… we pray as a family..and INDEED THERE WAS A MIRACLE..we saw His hands moved..as provisions come, prayers, friends, family, blood donors came (even from people we hardly knew)…
<br /><br />I know God is in control.
<br /><br />On her 3rd day when Nicole can finally sit down and move around her bed.. she asked me to lift the curtain and open the window. She was so excited to finally get up and go home.. and she stared at the sky.. she started to describe how beautiful it is.. so brilliant and blue… the clouds were so white and so fluffy… simple things…
<br /><br />Funny it may seem but often times when were so caught up with a lot of things.. our busy schedule… our so perfect world… and any other things.. we didn’t even bother to appreciate simple things… For Nicole, it’s not just a beautiful sky… because as a rainbow appeared.. I know it stirs up hope in her heart… the desire to get well and see more of God’s creation… to us it may be just a sky.. but it’s something that we have to be thankful for. At that very moment I was reminded by what Paul wrote on Ephesians 5:20.. (Give thanks for everything..)
<br /><br />… everything means..for every little thing.. even when things doesn’t seem to be in our right perspective.. give thanks... we need to be thankful even though circumstances seems hard for us… give thanks.
<br /><br />We need to be thankful for everything… even when Nicole got sick.. I claimed and thanked God for  healing.. I chose to thank God for our time together, me having the opportunity to serve her, take good care of her, watch her sleep, help her get up, uplift her, love her and for every little thing that we can share even at that hard time of our life. I thanked God from the comfortable bed as I watch her regain her strength, for the airconditioned room… for the doctors and nurses, for the patient that she shares her room with, for an opportunity to bless others even through simple ways… for our pastors and church members who stood with us in prayer..for vgroup leaders, for family and friends who spends time to visit her, pray for her.. for blood donors whom we don’t even know about.. for every little thing that came our way during those times. We can never thank you all enough..
<br /><br />We thank God for those reasons..for every little thing that He showed Himself real to us and to our family… Hard time it may seem but I  still chose to give thanks because I know He will never  let us down.. He will not let us go through all of  it alone.. He’s with us every step of the way..we praise the Lord.. for everything praise Him.
<br /><br />I saw a project thankful in the net today (marta.writes.com) and I know this is also an opportunity for us to say “THANK YOU” to God.. for each new day that lies ahead of us… or even for a stormy day that we just went through… for every little thing that God is doing to you.. Give thanks…
<br /><br />Here’s a list of some things that I thank God for…
<br /><br />~I thank God for every morning, and even for a good night sleep, for every lovely kiss whenever Henry leaves for work and whenever he arrives home.. for my loving and beautiful Nicole..for a supportive Mom and siblings, for cute and adorable nieces, for wonderful friends who makes me feel loved all the time,  food on the table, snack time, FB time, movie time.. for payday and clients.. for opportunity to pray for others, serve in the ministry… for vgroups..even for simple taxi time…and so much more.. There will always be reasons for us to be thankful for…for everything…
<br /><br />now what’s on your list?
