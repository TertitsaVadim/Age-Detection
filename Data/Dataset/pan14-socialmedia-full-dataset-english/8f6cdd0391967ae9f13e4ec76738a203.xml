<br /><br />has it ever occured to you the no matter how a person looks
<br />how they dress or their orientation or even race has nothing to do with you stupid people at all?
<br />have you ever looked in a mirror and see perfection? then why would you judge someone else?
<br /><br />what right do you have to judge someone who never did anything to you except prove they have more balls then you do.....
<br /><br />i am so sick of hearing people bad mouthing GLBT and this doesnt nessicaryily mean as much that i myself am bi-sexual its mainly for the fact that we are all human no matter what we say do or look or who we love..
<br /><br />and until you stupid close-minded ppl understand that you will be nothing more then someone who puts ppl down for no reason but to try anf find who they are in their lives...

<br /><br />Been scared and lonely
<br />I've asked myself is something wrong with you
<br />My girlfriend told me
<br />I need some time alone to deal with issues
<br /><br />But something makes me carry on
<br />It's difficult to understand 
<br />Why I always wanna fly
<br /><br />I do it for the drugs
<br />I do it just to feel alive
<br />I do it for the love
<br />That I get from the bottom of a bottle
<br /><br />You always call me
<br />And ask me how I make it through the day
<br />I'm always fallin'
<br />I guess it's just God's way of making me pay
<br /><br />But something makes me carry on
<br />It's difficult to understand, why I always wanna fly
<br /><br />I do it for the drugs
<br />I do it just to feel alive
<br />I do it for the love
<br />That I get from the bottom of a bottle
<br />I do it for the drugs
<br />I do it just to feel alive
<br />I do it for the love
<br />That I get from the bottom of a bottle
<br /><br />When I, I wonder why I try
<br />And I, I wonder why I bother
<br />And I, I wonder why I cry
<br />Why I, I go through all this trouble
<br /><br />I do it for the drugs
<br />I do it just to feel alive
<br />I do it for the love
<br />That I get from the bottom of a bottle
<br />I do it for the drugs
<br />I do it just to feel alive
<br />I do it for the love
<br />That I get from the bottom of a bottle

<br />they won't let me go the wrong way
<br />my mother taught me all the fables, told me how
<br />in the end all the sinners have to pay 
<br />but...
<br /><br />i don't wanna live like my mother
<br />i don't wanna let fear rule my life
<br />and i don't wanna live like my father
<br />i don't wanna give up before i die
<br /><br />he worked so hard his bones are breaking
<br />he wore them down but long ago he lost the feeling
<br />his good intentions leave me shaking, show me how
<br />i don't ever want to end up like he did
<br />and...
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br /><br />when i have kids
<br />i won't put any chains on their wrists, i won't
<br />i'll tell them this
<br />there's nothing in this world that you can't be if you want it enough

<br />lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids
<br />losing ground and falling faster
<br />into a life that no one should have to live
<br /><br />we are the people that you hate
<br />we are the bastards that you created (the fucking bastards that you created)
<br />a generation with no place
<br />a generation of all your sons and daughters
<br /><br />behind the fake family image
<br />behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads
<br />inside the cage that we've been given
<br />i see an image of the future that we don't have
<br /><br />(chorus)
<br /><br />and what did you expect ... a perfect child
<br />raised by tv sets ... abandoned every mile
<br />we never get respect ... never a fair trial
<br />no one gives a shit ... as long as we smile

<br />Tell e your fiction 
<br />Tell me your lies 
<br />Say to me now, you'll never forget this night 
<br />I'm feeling emotionless 
<br />My head's so clear 
<br />My enemies aren't, the one I fear 
<br />You know your kiss confused 
<br />This troubling soul 
<br />And I found out 
<br />That we're all breaking hearts 
<br />That we're all broken hearts 
<br /><br />CHORUS: 
<br />If only love could us all 
<br />If only hearts didn't have to fall 
<br />We can't mislead to make things right 
<br />So instead we'll sleep alone tonight 
<br /><br />What's the way of love? 
<br />You are thinking I'm crazy 
<br />But you're blushing of lust 
<br />I've heard a lot of nice things, 
<br />but tell me which ones I'm to trust? 
<br />These walls we made are glass 
<br />And they have been known to crack 
<br />But until then 
<br />You'll keep pushing my way 
<br />And I'll keep pushing you away 
<br /><br />CHORUS 
<br /><br />If you want to take a chance 
<br />And try to make things right 
<br />You better have a reason to be loved 
<br />We all want something more 
<br />And it is worth fighting for... 
<br /><br />CHORUS 
<br /><br />And if somehow fate were in my hands 
<br />Would it be enough to understand 
<br />Why we feel lost in a world so small 
<br />If only love could find us all...

<br />Never thought that I could love
<br />Living in shadows, faded existence
<br />It was never good enough
<br />Within the darkness, you were the light
<br />That shines away
<br />You’re trapped in violence, I can be the man
<br />That saves the day
<br /><br />I’m there for you
<br />No matter what
<br />I’m there for you
<br />Never giving up
<br />I’m there for you
<br />For you
<br /><br />Someone has changed me, something saved me
<br />Now this is who I am
<br />Although I was blinded, my heart let me find that
<br />Truth makes a better man
<br />I didn’t notice that you were right in front of me
<br />A mask of silence, we’ll put away so we can see
<br /><br />I’m there for you
<br />No matter what
<br />I’m there for you
<br />Never giving up
<br />I’m there for you
<br />For you
<br /><br />For you
<br /><br />Within the darkness, you are the light
<br />That shines away
<br />In this blind justice, I can be the man
<br />That saves the day
<br /><br />I’m there for you
<br />No matter what
<br />I’m there for you
<br />Never giving up
<br /><br />You know it’s true
<br />You were there for me

<br />So lately, been wondering
<br />Who will be there to take my place
<br />When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
<br />If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
<br />Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own
<br /><br />If I could, then I would,
<br />I'll go wherever you will go
<br />Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go
<br /><br />And maybe, I'll find out
<br />A way to make it back someday
<br />To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
<br />If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
<br />Then I hope there's someone out there
<br />Who can bring me back to you
<br /><br />Chorus
<br /><br />Run away with my heart
<br />Run away with my hope
<br />Run away with my love
<br /><br />I know now, just quite how, 
<br />My life and love may still go on
<br />In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time

<br />There was a brighter day
<br />Where I could view the world
<br />Without the sorrows that I've known (What if I could feel)
<br />Now it's a different place
<br />Memories fade away
<br />Without a trace
<br />But there's a shadow
<br />A shadow I can't feel
<br /><br />My eyes are closing softly (I never wanted to be)
<br />Inside these walls I fade away (I never wanted to be)
<br />Still holding on 'cause this is
<br /><br />Far from over
<br />I won't say goodnight
<br />My heart's grown colder
<br />Waiting for the sun to rise again
<br />Crawling closer
<br />So save your kiss goodbye
<br />It's far from over
<br />I won't fear anymore
<br /><br />Wait
<br />I know it's not too late
<br />Even though the innocence is scarred
<br />There's still tomorrow (What if I could see)
<br />I could just escape
<br />Close my eyes and dream about
<br />A sentimental vision
<br />A vision I could feel
<br /><br />This time I won't go softly (I never wanted to be)
<br />Refuse to simply fade away (I never wanted to be)
<br />Still holding on 'cause this is
<br /><br />Far from over
<br />I won't say goodnight
<br />My heart's grown colder
<br />Waiting for the sun to rise again
<br />Crawling closer
<br />So save your kiss goodbye
<br />It's far from over
<br />I won't fear anymore
<br /><br />What if I could feel
<br />What if I could see (What if I could see)
<br />Again
<br /><br />It's far from over
<br />And I am crawling closer
<br /><br />Far from over
<br />I won't say goodnight
<br />My heart's grown colder
<br />Waiting for the sun to rise again
<br />Crawling closer
<br />So save your kiss goodbye
<br />It's far from over
<br />I won't fear anymore
<br /><br />Far from over
<br />Far from over (Waiting for the sun)
<br />Far from over
<br />I won't fear anymore

<br />I've been searching for you
<br />I heard a cry within my soul
<br />I've never had a yearning quite like this before
<br />Now that you are walking right through my door
<br /><br />All of my life
<br />Where have you been
<br />I wonder if I'll ever see you again
<br />And if that day comes
<br />I know we could win
<br />I wonder if I'll ever see you again
<br /><br />A sacred gift of heaven
<br />For better worse wherever
<br />And I would never let somebody break you down.
<br />Until you cried... never
<br /><br />All of my life
<br />Where have you been
<br />I wonder if I'll ever see you again
<br />And if that day comes
<br />I know we could win
<br />I wonder if I'll ever see you again
<br /><br />At every time, I've always known
<br />That you where there, upon your throne
<br />A lonely queen, without her king
<br />I longed for you, my love forever
<br /><br />All of my life
<br />Where have you been
<br />I wonder if I'll ever see you again
<br />And if that day comes
<br />I know we could win
