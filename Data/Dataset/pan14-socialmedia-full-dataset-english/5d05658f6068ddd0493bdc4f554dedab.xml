Sometimes customers get the wrong idea of what we are trying to achieve. I am writing this entry to assist customers in understanding the concept of Customer Service, and what to do when contacting Client Care or Technical Support.>>Please respect Customer Service and Technical Support Agents. It is important to understand that these people are not against you. Remember, Customer Service Agents are customers too!>>Do not yell or compain to agents about company policies and procedures. Customer Service and Technical Support can not -ever- override company policies. All companies have procedures for customers to file complains. Please use them.>>Do not ask to speak to a supervisor. It will not help you. A supervisor's job is to ensure that the agents are following company procedures, so a supervisor will not likely reverse the decision of an agent unless the agent is outright wrong. Supervisors also can not change company policies. Again, you must use the procedures that are in place to file a complaint.>>Please do not "tie up" an agent. Agents' call lengths are monitored. A call center rep can get in trouble if the call handling time is too long. Please be respectful. I'm sure you don't like getting in crap by your boss. It is also disrespectful to other customers calling, who have to wait. Also, do you like having to wait on hold forever? The other clients calling don't, either.>>Please do not ask to speak to "so-and-so". In most call center environments, this is not allowed or even possible. You are calling a center that may well have over 200 people in different buidings.If calling Technical Support, please adhere to the following:>>Try some troubleshooting yourself. The worst thing is when somebody calls, and the problem could have been fixed by simply doing a reset or READING THE MANUAL.>>R.T.F.M., Read The Freaking Manual. Most Technical Support centers do not support "How To". You will likely have to wait on hold for a long time, to just be told, "We don't support that.">>Please don't say, "It worked before", or "My friend's is working". Who cares? The point is, YOURS is not working NOW.>>Please follow all instructions provided by the Technical Support Agent. We are here to help you. It does not help to be uncooperative, or say "I did that, already". Again, who cares? If you are being asked to do something NOW, there is a reason.>>Do not be rude. Don't say, "The people in the store are stupid.", "The last person I talked to is stupid", "You are stupid". It does not help, and in most cases, this is considered abuse, and the agent will be allowed to disconnect you. Where I work, all Technical Support Agents are required to have a post-secondary education. Nobody here is stupid.>>Do not say, "Your (company's) customer service sucks." What exacly would you like me to do about it? Once again, you should go through the procedure to file a complaint. Technical Support can not file complaints for customers.Following these rules will make things easier for all.Thank you.

Every year it gets more expensive to attend, but the "exhibits" are getting abysmal.I remember the CNE from the '70s. It was better, even for a child. However, I wish I was around during the CNE's heydays, the '50s and '60s.It seems now, the Exhibition is nothing more than a glorified over-priced flea market. You pay $14 to get in, and are then expected to buy something, and get screwed at the concessions. $3 for a soft drink and $2 for a bottle of water. Plus the CNE really doesn't mean what is used to. It is too commercialized. The renaming and re-usage of the buildings. The Colleseum, now called Ricoh Colleseum. The former National Trade Center, renamed Direct Energy Center. The Direct Energy Center is a convention center. Just what Toronto needs, another convention center. During the Ex, the entire Direct Energy Center is used as a giant flea market with booths selling over-priced garbage.The Horticultural Buiding, once housed the Agricultural Exhibit. The Agricultral Exhibit has moved to the Automotive Building. This year, the Automotive Building is being restored, so the Agricultural Exhibit has been moved to the Better Living Center, which was originally intended to display household improvement exhibits. The east wing of the Better Living Center has been sealed off, and is now a casino. The casio was originally in the Goverment Building, which is now Medieval Times.Although the Horticulural Buiding is not used for regular exhibits, it is rented out for special events. Once there was professional boxing in there, but like everything else at the Ex, it was unreasonably expensive. $100 - $500 for tickets to watch crappy local boxers, who I could beat while blindfolded.Then there is the Government of Ontario Building, which is now a nightclub. Another thing Toronto really needs.The Queen Elizabeth Theatre, once a great, thriving stage, now abandoned and sealed off.How about the Food Building? A big building with common fast-food outlets, who double their prices just for the CNE. What ever happened to the International Food Pavilion? It used to be on the west side of Exhibition Place. Now, its gone. Not a trace is left.Also gone is the Bulova Tower, and the Alpine Ride. Why? These were reasons why people visited the CNE.Last year, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame was torn down to make way for BMO Field, so Toronto can have a professional soccer team. Oh, yeah, Toronto needed a soccer team real bad.Every year the Exhibition organizers complain about poor turnout. Well, really? I wonder why?The CNE needs to go back to its roots. Bring back the traditional exhibits, and stop ripping off people.

Too many police just don't care. I can give you quite a few personal examples of this, but I would fill up the blog. I have to say that the Toronto police are a bit better then the Hamilton police. I hated dealing with Hamilton police. They are as useful as tits on a bull. However, Toronto police are far from perfect. Three years ago I was looking after my father's house because he was away on vacation. I decided to go out for a while, because, well, I have a life too. Upon returning, I discoved that someone had broken in, by smashing out a panel of glass and unlocking the door. I entered, and unfortunately, there was nobody inside. Yes, I said unfortunately. Anyway, some of my father's property and money had grown legs and walked out the door. I figured, the responsible thing to do would be to file a police report. Does anyone want to guess how long it took for an officer to show? ....nope....higher....nope....higher........Try four hours! The excuse I was given was that they were very busy. Plus, after all that they never did find out who broke in. The strange part is, I found out who broke in. It was somebody we knew. Now, why could the police not find that, but I had to. I pay the police for that service, and I ended up doing all the work. The person responsible returned most of what was taken. That is not the point. To make things worse, the following week, I see police at a nearby bank, chasing away skateboarders! Yeah, that's how busy the poice are. Thank you for ridding Toronto of the evil skateboarders. I feel much safer now.I also feel that police don't really care about the rest of the community, or people's property. I read on another PAN blog of a woman, whose door was broken by the police. They apparently had the wrong house, but they never apologized or offered to repair the door. Also, what about when police have to close down a street or a subway station, or whatever for some stupid lenghthy investigation about something that nobody cares about? Hey, if police need to "investigate" something, they can damn well do it around me. This may come as a surprise to the police: Just because you have a little issue, does not mean the rest of the city shuts down. People still have places to go. My boss will not allow me to be late, or pay me for such just because the police have a little problem. That is not my boss's problem, or mine for that matter. Are the police going to pay my lost wages? Yeah, sure. Just like they payed for that woman's door they broke!OK, enough about police. How about the police wannabes? Security guards. What the hell is their problem?Again, I have had many issues with these idiots too.I remember one incident at the Toronto Bus Terminal. This was when GO Transit had service there, before moving into their own terminal. I was waiting for a bus to Hamilton. This "security guard" came up to me and demanded to see my ticket. Well, here is a newsflash buddy, you are not a collector, therefore I don't have to show you shit. Well, he got angry because I would not show him the ticket. He wanted me to leave the station. I didn't. He called the police to have me removed, but of course by the time they showed up, I was already in Hamilton. I complained about the incident later, and he got in major crap.Another time, I was told by a guard at East York Center that I was not allowed in the building. He did not give a reason, and did not really have any reason not to allow me in. Nobody at Management ever said I was not allowed in. Once again, I complained, and the guard got in crap.Then, of course, there was the recent Squire and Firkin incident. You already know the outcome of that. By-the-way, I still have not used my $20 gift certificate.I have also had security guard problems at a Staples store and a Government of Canada building. Both of those times I also complained, and won. Are you seeing a pattern here?I don't know why security guards have such an attitude. Remember, they do not own the properties they are guarding. They need to grow up.

<br />What do all of the following services have in common?
<br />Ambulance, 911, Fire fighters, Public transit, Healthcare, Education.
<br />What do these services all have in common?
<br />Cable TV, Cellular phone, Mobile Internet, Text messaging.  
<br />What is the difference between these two groups of services?
<br />Here are the answers:
<br />The first group of services are <strong>necessary</strong> services.
<br />The second group of services are <strong>convenience</strong> services.
<br />The difference is, convenience services are not required to conduct a normal everyday life.
<br />Why then, do people get so upset when one of the <strong>unnecessary</strong> services does not work properly?
<br />Working at my capacity at [enter the name of any telecommunications company], I get a few clients who get extremely upset when something does not work right. I have had customers yelling, even crying. Why? Cellular phone and all related services are <strong>unnecessary</strong> services. 
<br />I have had people complain about having to send a phone for repair, and taking six weeks. So, what? Here is the truth: If you can't live without a cell phone for six weeks, you are in serious need of therapy. Cell phones are a convenience only. They are not intended to replace landlines or other forms of communication. Here is a newsflash: Cell phones don't work during major blackouts. What are you going to do if you only have a mobile phone, and need to call 911 during a power outage?
<br />I have had people complain about their Blackberry not working properly, and complain about lost business because &quot;I run my business from this&quot;. Really? Well, if you rely totally on your Blackberry for business and have no backup, I hope your business fails, because you don't deserve to have one. Granted, the Blackberry is a great business <em>tool</em> to <em>assist</em> with business operations, but it was never intended to replace all other business tools.
<br />Text messaging, Internet access, email on mobile devices, are all conveniences. That's all. 
<br />To be honest, if I had to pay for my cell phone service, I would not bother having it.
<br />My point to all this? None of the services offered by [enter the name of any telecommunications company] are not important enough to have a cardiac arrest over. Yes, I agree that customers are paying for these services, and have the right to expect them to work. However, these customers <em>choose</em> to have them as a convenience only. Do not yell or cry or complain to the staff of [enter the name of any telecommunications company] if there is a problem with  your service. We will gladly help you, but don't disrespect us. Believe me, you will get a lot farther by being polite.
<br />Besides, is this <strong>unnecessary</strong> service really worth getting all stressed out over? Remember: Stress kills!

This has interested me for a long time, so I did some research. Everyone, including I, have an opinion about this. This article is not about anyone’s opinion. It is based on facts collected from many different sources. We will look at the immediate and long term affects the use of such a device can have on a person, based on information collected from medical professionals.
<br />First of all, besides the obvious, what immediate affect does it have? How about infection? If you look at photos of Taser entry points, there is always a red around it. Well, we all know this is caused by an infection. When you get a needle from your doctor, it does not turn red, because the needle tip is steamed first. It is obvious that Taser barbs are not dipped into boiling water before being used, so who knows how many thousands of bacteria and other germ cultures are living on those barb tips? These germs enter the body, and cause illness. For all we know, some of the reported Taser deaths could have been caused by a viral infection. Most Tasered people who get sick a few days later may just write it off as having a cold, and not making a connection to the Taser attack.  
<br />How about the long-term affects, like nerve and muscle damage? Think about this: When a Taser is used, there is 20,000 volts traveling through a nerve and into muscles designed to only have a couple of  milli-volts. What happens to an air tube when you put too much pressure through it? A water pipe? Even electric wires have a voltage rating. When you put too much voltage (electrical pressure) through a copper conductor, the copper begins to break-down. There is no immediate or spectacular result, but it weakens the conductor. Many years later, even when not stressed, the conductor could fail. Therefore, a person who is Tased could well experience nerve damage 20 or 25 years down the road. Once again, not connecting it to the Taser, being so long ago. The same can be true for muscle tissue breakdown. If a muscle is forced to contract beyond its normal contraction point, can that not cause muscle damage? It is like a slightly over-inflated balloon. It may not bust now, but it eventually will. 
<br />Taser supporters are always saying how this device is safe because the current is very low. Well, that depends. Current is never pushed. It is pulled through the load. It all depends on the resistance. Current draw is inversely proportional to the resistance, and directly proportional to the voltage. A high voltage helps push current through a high-resistance load. If you look at the average resistance of the human body, it is about 20,000 ohms. However, if the skin is moist, from sweat for example, it lowers the resistance by almost 50%. In a case where a person is being Tased, they would likely be sweating. You are then looking at a resistance of 10,000 ohms. From my electricity class in college, we were taught about how much current is required to cause damage to a person. At 0.1 amps you feel a tingle, and 0.3 amps your muscles contract. At 0.6 amps, you are dead.
<br />Already we know there must be at least 0.3 amps being pulled from the Taser to cause the muscle contraction. Let’s check using Ohm’s Law. E = IR. That is Voltage equals Ohms multiplied by Amps. 20,000 volts / 10,000 ohms = 2. That’s 2 amps! That’s what is required to light four 60 watt bulbs, or run a big-screen TV. 
<br />Even if there is no immediate affect, it is very likely that a person could suffer a problem later. So, what do we do? Anyone who has been Tased can do themselves and others a favor, by being checked out by a physician immediately. Make sure the check-up is recorded, and track any and all problems that could be traced back to the use of the Taser device. If it is found 20 years later, that the Taser is at fault, then appropriate action can be taken.
<br />Taser International claims their product is safe. Well, of course they do. What company is going to admit to making an unsafe product?
<br />So, are Tasers safe? To be fair to everyone, we really don’t know yet. If it takes 20 - 30 years to find out, then police departments should not use them until that time. It is part of their responsibility to the community.

Now I have to look at it every day. It was bad enough seeing them on subway platforms. I do not like Koodo ads because they are misleading. First of all, this crap about &quot;no system access fee&quot;, is just that. Crap. There is <strong>always</strong> a system access fee. The CRTC requires cell phone carriers to charge this fee. With Kodoo, it is included in your monthly fee. Which in my opinion, is wrong. At least Bell and Rogers are open and honest with their customers, and tell you exactly what you are paying.
<br />Another thing about Koodo is this per-second billing garbage. Per-second billing has not been approved by the CRTC. Which means if one of the other companies complains, Koodo will have to stop offering this service.
<br />Now, on to more Technical Support stuff. First of all, I want to explain why you still have to pay your monthly cell phone bill even when your phone goes in for repair. Do you still pay your cable bill when your TV is broken? Do you still pay for your license plate when you car is out of service?  You still have to pay, because you still have service. Even if you can't use it. You have a phone number reserved that nobody else can use. Like with the system access fee, the CRTC requires cell phone companies to continue billing you, because you still have a number. It does not matter that you can not use it. Too bad. There are other things you can do. Borrow someone else's phone, use an old phone, ect. Here is another example: Web site domain names. You have to pay a yearly fee to have a domain name. Like <a href="http://www.pan.netcom" target="_blank">www.pan.netcom</a>. If PAN does not use the name, or has a server problem, and can't use it, they still have to pay for it. It is theirs and nobody else can use it. Once again, too bad.
<br />Also, please don't ask, &quot;Why did the store not tell me&quot;. Stores don't have to tell you diddly-squat. It is their job to sell. If you want to know about any problems with a product, it is up to you to do your own research. Don't get mad at the store or technical support because you were too damn lazy to research the product. If you bought a lemon. You chose to buy it. Remember: Buyer Beware. Once again, too bad.
<br />Finally, why do people call technical support for things they can fix themselves? I had several people call today because of errors with their Blackberry Desktop Manager or Device Software. It was something they could have fixed themselves, by looking it up on the Internet. It took me 20 seconds to find it. These people waited over 20 minutes on the phone for something they could have looked up in 20 seconds. Plus, these are the people who complain about waiting so long. Well, um, the reason you are waiting so long, is because of the number of people calling in for this very thing. Don't complain. It is your own fault. Learn to use other resources. Once again, too bad.

Wow, bet you couldn’t figure that one out! I will write “Paul’s Week in Review” whenever I have ‘one of those weeks’, which lately has been every week. 
<br />Welcome to the very first “Paul’s Week in Review”, which covers the week of November 16 - 22 /2008.
<br /><br />SUNDAY: I went to GNC to buy some more protein supplement. They had one on sale for $27.95, which is almost half of the regular price. The salesperson advised me not to buy that one because ‘It isn’t very good’. Odd, I didn’t know there were different grades of protein. I also didn’t know that the quality can drop in one month. Since, this same guy recommended the same protein a month ago when it was $45.50.
<br /><br />MONDAY: I finally received my well-deserved raise. I had been bugging the boss about it, because everyone else in my department was getting a dollar more then I. The boss told me that I had already been getting the raise, apparently since July. Oh, my mistake. It must have been one of those ‘special’ raises. 
<br /><br />TUESDAY: Good news, the Toronto Transit Commission is improving bus service! All routes will now operate everyday, including Sundays, until at least 1 am. I read this in a newspaper as I waited in a subway delay.
<br /><br />WEDNESDAY: Toronto area’s first stow storm. Dandruff was falling heavy from the sky as I waited for the 9:15 number 35 Mississauga bus. Mississauga Transit is great because their buses are always on time. Seriously, I have never seen one late. My feet were cold, and I was getting soaked by snow by the time the bus pulled up at 9:47.
<br /><br />THURSDAY: Going to work on the number 35 Mississauga bus, the bus stopped dead right on Dundas Street, where Bloor and Dundas cross. Apparently, the air brakes locked. We were there for five minutes as the driver tried to recharge the brakes. While this was happening, a Toronto police officer came up to the bus, obviously mistaking it for a donut shop.  He pushed open the doors to find out why this bus driver was stopped in the middle of Dundas Street. The bus driver again tried to move the bus, and surprisingly, it moved! Somehow, pushing the doors open unlocked the brakes. Wow, who knew that the front doors of a bus are connected to the brakes? 
<br /><br />FRIDAY:  The CIBC Branch in my building was robbed again. I have lived in this building for two years, and this bank has been robbed three times since. I am surprised that banks still get robbed. Welcome to the Old West.
<br />It was a mess. There were four police cars out front and many police walking around the ground floor of the building with thumbs up butts, not knowing what to do. Too bad there wasn’t a broken down bus nearby.
<br />On the way to work, I stopped at Islington Station to get some Mississauga bus tickets. There was a huge lineup there. How many of those people were buying tickets? Just one. Me. Everyone else was asking “How do I get to..” I’d like to tell you how to get to hell. What’s wrong? The three gigantic Mississauga Transit maps are not enough?
<br /><br />SATURDAY: I went to the bank today, the Scotiabank at Islington and Bloor. It is the closest one that is open on Saturdays.  I have been trying to register for online banking for about a year, and it never seems to work. I called Scotiabank customer service, and was advised to visit a branch to register.  I went today. The last time I went to this branch on a Saturday, there was nobody in there. I was able to walk right up to a teller. Well, of course today, because I was in a hurry, there was a giant line. It was – 7 outside, so I was wearing a million sweaters. The bank had the thermostat cranked. The tellers were walking around in T-shirts. I, of course, was sweating. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, sweating, the teller told me that I can’t register for online banking at the branch, I would have to call customer service. Didn’t customer service just tell me to register at a branch?  At this point I would like to tell Scotiabank exactly what they can do with their online banking, and all the rest of their banking for that matter.
<br />I then had to go to Cloverdale Mall. I had to take the 111 bus. It was packed as it always is on Saturday. This is because it only runs every 20 minutes, which is obviously not enough. It is great that the TTC is expanding bus service, but how about more buses instead of crowding people like sardines? 
<br />Coming home from the mall, there was a very long wait for the bus.  Then a long wait at the subway station for the train to move its butt. One hour! One hour it took to get home from Cloverdale Mall. Think about this: Its five kilometers! Yes, a five kilometer trip took an hour, most of it waiting. We can be sure there is going to be a fare increase next year. After all, somebody has to pay for all this waiting.
<br /><br />“Paul’s Week in Review” summary for November 16-22 /2008: Lots of problems with buses, banks and bosses. Hopefully next week will be better.
<br /><br />--Paul

I spent two weeks in a South Florida school, after which she pulled me out, and sent me back to a real school here in Ontario. At the time I didn’t really understand why she did that.
<br />I now have a step-sister who is a school teacher in South Florida. She teaches Grade 7. She gave a test to her students at the beginning of the year to test their abilities. Just for the heck of it she sent me the test results. Over half of the class failed. 
<br />First, see if you can answer the questions yourself. Then look at the correct answers, and the wrong answers given by the students.
<br />Are you smarter than Florida Grade 7 students?

<br /><br />Once again, this is Grade 7! When I went to school there (Also grade 7), they really were still teaching basic Mathematics and English. They called English, &quot;Language Arts&quot;. I guess learning English is an Art in the state of Florida! In Ontario, we were studying 'Hamlet' and Trigonometry by Grade 7.
<br />All I can say after seeing this is, I hope these students have a rewarding career at McDonalds and Wal-Mart.

It seems every day something happens in the news and it always reflects back to the “Sagging Global Economy”. Well, of course the economy is sagging. We are being pummeled by the media to believe that everything that happens is the fault of the economy. It depresses people, and that is what affects the economic situation. Maybe that is why it is called a depression? “It is going to be a colder winter this year…because of the economy”. “Two people were injured in a collision…because of the economy”. Stop blaming the “economic situation” for everything that happens. Honestly, there really isn’t an “economic situation”. The economy is fine, except that certain people in high places want us to believe otherwise. They are trying to create a panic, which will then definitely create an “economic situation”.  Good job.
<br />Even with the TSX. Why do the media get so upset when the stock market falls? Oh, look the TSX is down 900 points…because of the economy. Nobody ever says the TSX is up 900 points because of the economy.  Why is that? I mean, the stock market is always up and down like a toilet seat. That’s what it does. That’s its job. It does not necessarily mean there is a problem with the economy. 
<br />If you want to protect yourself against a so-called “sagging economy”, ignore the hype. Just go about your business. If we listen to these fools, we really will have a sagging economy.
<br />This brings me to my next point, which is kind of related: The Minority Coalition.  Some agree, some disagree. This is important, because of the current so-called “economic crisis”.  I think the Coalition is a good idea, because I really don’t think Prime Minister Imageek can handle his own government, much less the pending doom that is “a complete a total world-wide economic break down.” I am happy about the Coalition, as we need to get Prime Minister Imageek out of there. I don’t trust him, I never did trust him, and never will trust him. Regardless of any economic situation or otherwise, this is a good idea. Think about it. Three different political parties are actually working together! This never happens! This can be nothing but good for Canada.
<br />Now, go out and buy something…expensive!

<br />Should everyone else be responsible for fixing the problems they created?
<br />The answers are “yes” and “yes”.
<br />I was impressed at the comments Michael Moore made when he was on ‘Larry King Live.’  He said that the auto manufacturers are in trouble because they are not producing the types of vehicles people want. This is so very true. Ford, Chrysler and GM were producing these huge-ass cars that nobody wants to drive anymore. They completely ignored the customers, which is a big mistake in business. People are buying Japanese and European cars, because they are smaller and less expensive to maintain and operate.  Look at the little Mercedes car. I call it the “Half-a-car”. Although, I wouldn’t want to take a trip across the country in it, it is perfect for bombing around the city running errands. If the North American car companies made cars like that, they would not be in so much trouble. 
<br />How about alternate-fuel vehicles? Solar-powered/battery operated cars? Even better: Hydrogen cars. Imagine a car that runs on water, and produces water! It is the perfect fuel. It renews itself as you use it. Who would be against something like that? This crap about being too expensive to produce is…crap! Gasoline-powered cars were expensive when they first came out. Once they caught on, they became less expensive. The way people are about environmentally-friendly vehicles these days, it would not take long for such a vehicle to become popular. Of course, the poor oil companies would get upset. Understandably, there are a lot of jobs that rely on the oil companies, especially in Alberta. However, it will take years for a full transition from gasoline to other fuels. It is not as if someone produces an electric or hydrogen car today, and the oil companies will have to close tomorrow. Besides, the oil companies can still play a part in producing alternate fuels. We would still need “gas stations”.  What are you going to do if your hydrogen car runs out of water in downtown Toronto? Run into a Starbucks and ask if you can use their washroom to fill your car? As far as electric-powered cars, we have electric buses now. Toronto has plenty of buses that actually run off a battery. They just plug them in at the garage to recharge. If we can make battery operated buses, we can certainly make battery operated cars.
<br />How about the “Big Three” producing more public transit vehicles? None of them produce any subway or tram vehicles. As far as I know, GM is the only one that makes buses, and they are very expensive. Toronto stopped buying buses from GM because they can get good quality buses from Orion or Flyer for a lot less money.  The auto companies should start making affordable environmentally-friendly public transit vehicles as well. 
<br />In the end, I guess we are responsible for bailing them out in order to save so many jobs. However, is this going to send out the wrong message? Yes, it is OK to ignore your clients. If you get in trouble, just run to the government for help.

Once again I waited until the Saturday before Christmas to do my shopping. Also, once again, I chose Yorkdale Mall to do it. Yes, Paul, go to one of Toronto’s busiest malls four days before Christmas. Right on, good one!
<br />I took the bus instead of the subway, because normally it is faster. I don’t have to go downtown to change trains. I just take the bus right up. Boy, was I wrong!
<br />It took 90 minutes to get from Bloor to Lawrence on that damn Dufferin bus. The traffic was at a complete standstill. Nothing moved going north on Dufferin, and east on Lawrence. The idiots traveling on Lawrence didn’t help by blocking the intersection, so nobody on Dufferin could move! We do not block the intersection. This is a basic driving rule. I don’t even drive and I remember that.
<br />Surprisingly, with all the traffic, the mall did not seem that busy. Then again, Yorkdale is a pretty big mall.
<br />After all the shopping, I decided I would like to see a movie. It had been over two years since I had been to a movie theatre, and going again yesterday reminded me why. 
<br />They have these kiosks now, where you can buy tickets using a credit or debit card. That is cool. I also recall the admission was higher before. It is $11.50 now, I remember paying close to $14.00 two years ago. So, that’s not bad. However, I did not expect to pay $11.50 for a small popcorn and a small Coke. 
<br />I took my ticket to the theatre, and though that somebody would be checking the tickets. Nobody was there! Nobody checks the tickets! Wow, so, if a movie isn’t sold out, you could walk right in and see the film for free! If I had known that, I could have saved $11.50.  
<br />So, as if the $23 I just paid wasn’t enough, I had to sit through eight minutes of advertising, and ten minutes of trailers before the stupid film started. Then it turned out to be not that great of a film.
<br />Now, I am prepared for the next time I go to a movie, sometime in 2011.

<br /><br /><em>As a person who lives in a major city, travelling by car is a luxury. With sky-high insurance rates, your second, third and fourth child for an hour of parking downtown, and 24/7 rush-hour traffic. Like most of us who live in a city of over 3 Million, public transportation is the way to travel. However, fares in major cities are higher than in smaller communities, but the service is not as good. We may have subway trains and bus service every five minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but how reliable?
<br /><br />This article is designed to help those who may be visiting a city, and choose to use the public transportation system. 
<br />Here are some tips when using train and/or bus service in a major city:
<br /><br />1&gt;	Expect to pay an unusually high fare. Generally, a single fare will run you the equivalent of a dinner for two at the Four Seasons. 
<br />2&gt;	There are two sets of schedules for the buses, the posted schedules, and the drivers' schedules. 
<br />3&gt;	Regardless of the time of day, and the line you travel, there will always be at least one delay on the subway system. 
<br />4&gt;	Bus drivers don't like to drive their buses. They prefer to stand around on bus platforms and talk on a cell phone or talk to each other, even if they are behind schedule. 
<br />5&gt;	Subway trains like to stop and wait at stations for long periods of time, for unknown reasons. Usually to change operators, who are up on the bus platform talking to the bus drivers. 
<br />6&gt;	Subway and bus system maps are designed to confuse you. 
<br />7&gt;	At any one time, at least one subway station will be closed for &quot;repairs&quot;. 
<br />8&gt;	Subway train operators will close the doors just as you are entering, causing a part of your body to be crushed and bruised. 
<br />9&gt;	When there is a delay on the subway system, the transit company will replace the entire subway system with one bus. 
<br />10&gt; There are no garbage cans on buses or subway trains, so you can just throw garbage on the floor like everyone else. 
<br />11&gt; There are no washrooms on buses or subway trains, that explains the smell. 
<br />12&gt; The route you use the most often will likely not have service when you need it. Sunday evening. 
<br />13&gt; Buses always travel very slowly when you are in a hurry. 
<br />14&gt; The vehicle you are travelling on will likely go out of service or short turn when you are in a hurry. 
<br />15&gt; Complaining to the transit company about any of the above will likely result in a sarcastic response.
<br /><br />I hope this helps you next time you need to use public transit in a big city.</em>

		<document id="406b5d1c3b08e027c49f6fc5ba04a6a" url=""><![CDATA[Its All About Contact (Sports)<br/><br/>I have enjoyed contact sports since I was 16.  One question that is sometimes asked of me is, “Aren’t you afraid of hurting someone?” I will answer that later.
<br />My dad left my mom when I was very young. So, I was raised under my mother’s influence. When I started grade 7, my mom moved to Florida to open a restaurant.  She took me with her, but when she realized the sad state of Florida schooling, she sent me back to live with my dad in Ontario.
<br />For a period, I was a bit of a wimp, up until my early high school years. I was picked on, bullied.  I was slim, not very muscular. Not good for a teenaged male. 
<br />I was introduced to boxing by a friend of my father’s. Not so much for the boxing itself, but for the exercise. Boxing training is very brutal. After only a few months, I began to notice a difference. So did my classmates, and as an added bonus, one of my classmates happened to walk by the boxing gym one day as I was leaving it. You know that word got around quickly. It did not take long for the bullying to stop. In a way, I was a bit disappointed that after all those years, I was never given the chance to let-loose on someone. I mean, nobody dared to challenge me after that, and I could not very well just go up and plough a guy. That would have been a major problem, my being a boxer and all. 
<br />I stayed interested in boxing for quite a long time.  I cut back on training for quite a few years, but started seriously again a couple of years ago for the exercise. 
<br />I have become to realize something else. I like the physical violent contact. Maybe it is because of all of the bullying from the past, but when I hit a man, I really hit! 
<br />Now, my boxing gym is going to be closing due to lack of membership. However, I have been seriously considering training at Randy Couture’s gym. I can still maintain my boxing, and also practice jiu-jitsu. Something I have always wanted to learn. It will only cost an additional $20 per month.  If I decide to do this, it means I will become double-dangerous. This is a good thing, right?  
<br />The whole idea of the combative sports is to disable your opponent. In boxing, you need to try for a knock out, or to cause some other injury that causes you opponent to forfeit. Blood, black-n-blue is beautiful. With Jiu-jitsu, the original intent was to break your opponent’s bones. Of course, it has unfortunately become more civilized, and we do not take it that far.  Now you just create an extreme pain until your opponent taps out. Well, OK, but personally, I think the sound of a bone cracking is much more pleasing to the ears.
<br />So, to answer the question, “Aren’t you afraid of hurting someone?” The answer is, “No, the thought of hurting someone does not bother me in the least.” I would be more afraid if I did <em>not</em> hurt someone, because it would mean I have not been practicing and training hard enough.
<br />I know what you are thinking. “That is so brutal and unnecessarily violent.” Well, I’m a guy. Males are supposed to be more physically aggressive. If we are not aggressive in sports, we are likely to take it somewhere else.  Look at hockey. Do you think it feels like a gentle massage getting cross-checked into the boards? It hurts, a lot. It is supposed to. These are contact sports. The people who participate know they are contact sports, and accept the fact there could be an injury. If you don’t like it, stay home a knit a sweater with Granny.  
<br />Finally, I am still not impressed with women who want to compete in combative sports. These sports are for men. I don’t find a female boxer/kickboxer or MMA fighter one bit attractive. As a matter-of-fact, I find it disgusting.  If a woman wants exercise, stay home and do some housework. You’d be surprised at how many calories you can burn off by pushing a vacuum cleaner around.
<br />Sorry, that was a sexist statement. I am not really sexist. I was simply trying to get my point across in my unusually sarcastic way.
<br />Now, who wants to fight?

I have decided to conduct a study of public transportation systems around the world. I would like to find out what cities have the best and worst systems, and how happy are the users? 
<br />I am currently studying systems in Canada, but I would still like to hear from everyone. I have set up a survey: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.misterpoll.com%2Fpolls%2F391151"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/391151</a> 
<br />Please take a few minutes to provide your comments about public transit. All of the results will become part of the study, and some of the results will be forwarded to the public transit operators.
<br />Thank you.
<br /><br />Currently, the following systems are being studied:
<br />South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority, Calgary Transit, Edmonton Transit System, Thunder Bay Transit, North Bay Transit, Sudbury Transit, Owen Sound Public Transit, Grand River Transit, Guelph Public Transit, Orangeville Transit, Brampton Transit, York Region Transit, Toronto Transit Commission, Ajax/Pickering Transit, Oshawa Transit Commission, Mississauga Transit, Oakville Transit, Milton Transit, Burlington Transit, Hamilton Street Railway, Niagara Transit, Transit Windsor, OC Transpo, Societe de transport de Montreal, Metrobus Transit.
<br />Others will be coming soon, including the United States and other countries!

<br />I didn’t realize it, because I was on my way home from work. I thought something wasn’t right when I noticed that Jane subway station didn’t have any platform lights. Well, that’s OK, sometimes a station loses power. Then, Runnymede station also had no light. Ummm, OK. That’s a coincidence. I really started getting concerned when High Park had no power. However, Keele station did have power, so I thought maybe it didn’t make it that far east. Sadly, my station, Dundas West, also was dark. Leaving the station, I also noticed that all the businesses, the traffic signals at Bloor and Dundas, and –yes- my high rise, were all completely dark. Damn! 
<br />I entered through the retail concourse which had some emergency lighting. Some drunks from the pub were hanging around the hallways, probably looking for another place to get a drink. When I entered my building lobby, there were at least thirty people waiting for an elevator. There is no access to the stairs from the lobby, which is dumb, but I didn’t design the building. Apparently, the blackout just occurred a few minutes previous. Security had called the building manager, who was not at all pleased with having to come to the building at ten-thirty at night. He was stomping around with a flashlight and two Toronto firefighters to see if anyone was trapped in any of the building’s twelve, yes, twelve, elevators. 
<br />Here I was, after working, and coming home in a minus double-digit temperature, to this!
<br />I was looking forward to a nice bowl of soup, followed by a nice can of chili with toast, in my nice comfy apartment. It looked like that wasn’t going to happen, at least not on this night. 
<br />One elevator was operating on emergency generator, so one of the bitchy staff was shuttling people up and down in the one car. I managed to get into the second group of sardines. When I finally arrived at my floor, I stumbled through the half-assed emergency lighting system to my door, which is not too far from the elevators, fortunately.
<br />I entered the pitch-black apartment, and of course the first thing I did was stub my big stupid toe on the big stupid chair in the hall by the door. Then I couldn’t find my freaking flashlight. The damn thing is always out in my way when I don’t need it. So, now when I do need it, it is no where to be found. 
<br />I couldn’t make dinner, and didn’t want to open the refrigerator, and of course the apartment is equipped with clean, electric heat.  Although it was still around nineteen degrees in there, according to the thermometer I could read by moonlight, with it being minus twenty outside, I didn’t think it would stay that warm for very long. It didn’t.
<br />There was an announcement over the building’s PA system from the Landlord. “Blah…blah…blah…and please keep your heating system off, so we don’t have a surge when power is restored…blah, blah, blah…”
<br />My nutcase neighbour was having some kind of a party in the bathroom, running the water like crazy, and making all kinds of odd noises. What the hell could one possibly be doing in the bathroom without any light? The only thing you should be doing in there during a blackout can be done perfectly well while sitting down. Besides, you should never run the water in a high-rise during a power outage, unless it is an emergency. Ummm, the pumps are not working. Dumbass. 
<br />I found my portable multi-band radio, which actually had working batteries. So, I plugged in some headphones and enjoyed Classical 96.3 from my recliner.  I apparently fell asleep there, but woke up at just past two in the morning to realize that the apartment had become very cold. From the moonlit thermometer, it was down to about sixteen degrees already. I had left the night lights on in the kitchen and bathroom, so I could tell when power was restored. Since they were still not on, I had decided to grab a blanket, and hit the bed. 
<br />I woke up again at four. I had to pee, but it was too cold, so screw it, I’ll hold it. 
<br />I woke up just before seven, to notice the kitchen night light was lit. Oh, good. That means I should be able to put the heat on, right? Wrong. The climate control did not come on. Not even the fan. It was dead.  Why, you ask? I found it was because people did exactly what the Landlord asked us not to do. They left their systems on, and it overloaded the circuit. So, there was no heat until eight o’clock when the maintenance guys came in. 
<br />Then, I left for work at around eleven, only to find that the subway system was shut down because of the blackout. OK, so how can yesterday’s blackout affect today’s subway system?  Anyway, I ended up having to take the bus to work. Fortunately, I left early enough to still get in on time.

<br />Today I had to reem-out Mississagua Transit for their buses never being on time. They are increasing the fare to $3, which is ridiculous. The number 35 always leaves early from Islington Bus Terminal. I called Mississaga Transit. The woman I spoke with had the nerve to tell me “Why don’t you leave earlier?” Excuse me? Screw you, lady. <em>You</em> leave earlier. I have a life and have other things to do. I am the customer, you make sure your buses leave on time. Don’t tell me what to do. Obviously, Mississauga Transit does not take me seriously. So, I am going to take matters into my own hands. The next time a bus does not leave on schedule, or does not arrive on schedule, I am not going to pay the fare. I don’t give a shit if the driver gets upset. He can call anyone he wants, it will not bother me one bit. It will only annoy the rest of the passengers, and then there will be more complaints.  I am not going to pay for lousy service. If you choose to increase the fee, expect to increase the service also, or expect more complaints. Too bad. It is bad enough that route only has 25 – 30 minute frequency.  That is not enough. Mississauga is a major city.  When you call to complain, you get excuses, or are told that it is your fault. 
<br />I’m sorry, but going forward, I am going to be taking on the “I don’t care, I am the customer, I am the boss” attitude. That’s it. I am tired of sitting back and seeing rates increase and service decrease.
<br />For some reason public transit and police are two groups of people who are dead-set on making my life more difficult. The last thing I need is more stress. That’s it. From now on, I am the boss, and these people are going to do what I want, or there is going to be a huge problem. Maybe that’s it. Not enough people complain. People feel sorry for the police and bus drivers. I don’t. They get paid a lot for doing very little. Get up off of your butts and do your damn job. Never mind asking for a raise and complaining about how difficult your job is.  Here is a newsflash: Nobody cares. 
<br />Here is a little personal message to police and public transit employees: Go to the zoo, eat baboon shit, then craw into an elephant’s ass and die.
<br />I thank you in advance for you cooperation.

<br />If I did not work in Mississauga, I would avoid it. I was considering living there, but I soon changed my mind.
<br />First of all, Mississauga -- sorry, Pississauga-- is the only city in Canada that has cut funding to public transit. They are raising the fare, and cutting service. Why would any city cut transit funding? The government keeps saying ‘Go Green, Take Transit’. Well great. How the hell are we supposed to do that when the service sucks?
<br />Most routes only operate at 30 minutes or fewer, and Sunday service, forget it. Take a taxi.
<br />I was happy last fall when Mississauga Transit expanded Route 35 into Toronto. I thought, “This is great. This is much more convenient.” Well, that was before I realized how unreliable the service is. These buses are never on time. For example, the latest incident that happened near the end of February: The bus was late two days in a row. It is supposed to leave at 12:54, but didn’t even show up until 1:12. When I approached the driver about his constant tardiness, he threw a tantrum like a 5-year-old.  “I am not late”, “I am supposed to be here at this time”. “I am calling a supervisor, and this bus isn’t moving until he gets here!” Oh OK, so, you are supposed to be 18 minutes late?
<br />Not only does the bus service stink, but this past winter, I had to climb over huge snow banks to get across the street.  So, what, are we not funding snow removal either? 
<br />The rich snobs in Mississauga don’t respect the environment, or anyone who does not drive.
<br />Every day there are 4 - 5 Mississauga Transit buses idling away at the Islington bus terminal for 18 minutes, as the drivers sit around picking their noses. Here is an idea, instead of cutting funding, how about cutting the drivers’ wages? They can’t even follow the freaking schedule. 
<br />You have that senile old bag Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallon, who has her head so far up her ass, she sneezes and farts at the same time. Toronto mayor David Miller may be the world’s biggest cry-baby, but at least he has the sense to support public transportation.  Toronto has just given the Toronto Transit Commission another budget increase. Toronto now has buses every 5 – 20 minutes every day, at all times, and they want to improve that! This is exactly how it should be.
<br />To conclude, I like Toronto a lot. I am proud to be from this city. Which. but the way, is <em>not</em> on the list of 'Canada’s Most Dangerous Cities.' Until the city of Mississauga changes attitude, I will not consider living there. 
<br />Oh, and those buses better start being on time. Mississauga has the highest bus fare in the world. I expect the best service in the world.

<br />I am working very hard to clear the stereotypes people have about boxers.  So far, this has been working well. However, I have discovered another. Boxers are not allowed to eat junk. I ate a doughnut once, you’d have thought I committed a felony. Geez, I’m sorry I ruined your day. Yes, I’m a boxer. That’s why I can eat a doughnut. Now, compared with Lardbutt, with fat ass planted on the sofa all day. Now, who is that doughnut least likely to have an affect?
<br />The sport has changed a lot. When I first started boxing in the 80s, it was a lot tougher. First of all, girls were not allowed in the gym. Which is probably not a bad thing. Secondly, the rounds were longer. Back then, rounds were three minutes long. Now they are down to two minutes, and in some cases, even just one minute. I trained to go for three minutes. Now, to go for just two minutes is a piece of cake.  Can a boxer have a piece of cake? 
<br />Many still compare “real” boxing to professional boxing. Well, that is like comparing professional wresting to real wrestling. 
<br />I have been boxing on and off since I was 18, and have competed in every weightclass. Currently I am a Light-heavyweight, very close to becoming a Heavyweight again. 
<br />There is an official weigh-in once every 55 - 70 days. This is the weight which will be posted on the roster. It is also the class at which you will compete for the next two months, or so. Most boxers will have a match monthly, either at competition level or exhibition level.  Competition match results affect your stats. Exhibition matches do not show up on your stats, but are an important training tool. 
<br />Sparring is also important. Sparring is done weekly. I usually do two rounds of soft sparring, and another two of hard sparring. This way, both my skills and physical abilities are tested.  
<br />Training and coaching sessions are three times a week at the boxing gym, but I also go to a fitness club in-between.  I actually go to the gym six times a week, with usually only Sunday off. Except of course on those few Sundays when I have a scheduled match.
<br />Yes, boxing is a tough sport. That is what makes it a great sport. It is a great test of skill and physical endurance.  Beating the shit of out the heavy bag for two minutes burns off about 175 calories. When you are in the ring against an opponent, you are looking at close to 400 calories per round. With a three-round match, that is 1200 calories! Plus, all of your other training on top. That is why boxers are in such amazing shape. 
<br />Boxers are the real athletes around here. 
<br />I won’t get into my opinions of different sports, now. That will be coming up in a future post.

Well, that is not true. First of all, I do not comment on places I have never been. Secondly, you may remember my entry from last summer, when I praised all of those small towns I visted. 
<br />I have wanted to vent about Hamilton for a very long time, except that I know people who live there. So, I want to make it clear right now that what I am about to comment does not apply to everyone in Hamilton. I would also like to say that I lived in Hamilton for quite a few years, and it is because of the crap that I moved.
<br />What is with Hamiltonians that they always have to start an agrument or complain, even if it something that is absolutely none of their business.
<br />Even at work, the majority of calls from Hamilton end up in a complaint or an argument. I have been tracking this for my own use. Hamilton is the worst for this kind of call at 89%. Calgary is a distant second at 42%, followed by Montreal at 40%. The best are Vancouver at 5%,  Toronto at 11%, and Ottawa at 12%.
<br />Here is an example: A caller last week had sent her PDA for repair. It could not be repaired, and that model had been discontinued. The depot sent her a replacement model, better than she had. This woman was so upset that she did not get the same model. Guess from where she was calling? Hamilton. Now, why would anyone complain about getting something better? Only someone from Hamilton.
<br />Here is another, just from today: A guy called with a customer service related issue. I explained that he had the wrong department, and that customer service is not open. He replied, &quot;Yes they are&quot;. Why the hell are you causing an argument? Arguing is not going to make them open, and besides you are calling Technical Support, and we only deal with technical issues. So shut up and call tomorrow, or so help me, I will put my fist through the phone and pound on you. Yes, this was another one from Hamilton.
<br />When I lived in Hamilton, I would often take a walk around after work to relax. Sometimes it was quite late. You would not believe how many people complained that I was walking aorund so late. ...and this is affecting you how, exactly?
<br />Really, Hamilton people need to grow up. 
<br />For a city that calls itself &quot;The Country and Western capital of Canada&quot;, believe me, being the Country and Western Capital of anything, isn't cool. So, mind your business, and stop being so argumentive. You are the only ones who act like that. That is why the rest of Canada laughs at you.
<br />As a footnote to my friends in Hamilton: I'm sorry, I needed to vent that.
<br /><br />//PKB, My personal opinion only.

Living in Toronto, where we pay through the wazoo for everything, I feel that I have the right to a high-quality of service, and therefore the right to complain.
<br />I have put together a collaboration of complaints I have made over the years. These are official complaints filed with head office. Also included are the number of responses I received. I will leave it up to you. Do I complain too much?

<br /><br />Date 25, 07, year 2009: 
<br />VIA Rail was on strike, but fortunately I had purchased my bus ticket 2 weeks previous. There was a huge line up for the bus, as all of the railfans were forced to use alternate transportation. We were scheduled to leave the Toronto terminal at 13:30. Of course we didn’t. There are always stragglers and people farting around. I guess the notice on the ticket that states “Line up 15 minutes early” is just there for decoration.
<br />We only made one stop one the way, Kingston. 
<br />We were making very good time. I called my friend who was to meet me at the Montréal terminal. “Yeah, we are making very good time. We should be right on time“.  Well, I should not have said that, because the moment we reached the city, there was a huge traffic jam on the 720.  Traffic did not move for the longest time. We made it in 45 minutes late, and I felt really bad. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933555" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_15492507_24933555.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />Date 26, 07, year 2009:
<br />Sunday morning. It was raining, and I was a pissed about it.  However, I decided we should go someplace indoors. I knew that one of my priorities was to see Biodôme. The Biodôme is next to Olympic Stadium. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933305" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_1462070_24933305.jpg" /></a>At one time it was part of it. It is an indoor zoo, where each section is maintained at a climate the animals are used to. Some sections have no fence between the exhibit and the visitors. In the Tropical Rainforest exhibit, a bird of some kind was walking right in amongst the people. Really quite cool.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933329" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_8155906_24933329.jpg" /></a>
<br />By this time, it had stopped raining, so we walked over to the Botanical Gardens.  I spent quite a long time there, and took quite a few photos. There was a fantastic Chinese Garden exhibit, too. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933380" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_13003008_24933380.jpg" /></a>We also went into the Insectarium. My friend found it boring, and said, “Its just a bunch of bugs”. Well, actually, it isn’t. I found it quite fascinating. Some of the “bugs” were quite interesting to watch. They were very colourful. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933452" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_2482539_24933452.jpg" /></a>
<br />For dinner we went to this BBQ place downtown. I wanted to try both the chicken and ribs, but they ran out of chicken. The ribs were very good, although expensive, I thought. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933533" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_13405112_24933533.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />Date 27, 07, year 2009:
<br />Monday was better weather, so we went to Mont-Royal. It is a dead volcano in the middle of the city. I said that it was dormant, and would wake up one day, and destroy the entire city of Montréal. Including the Canadiens, which wouldn’t be a huge loss, anyway. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933227" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_8901777_24933227.jpg" /></a>
<br />We took the scenic route around the mountain. There were these paths that went all over the place, and some very steep drops with no guard. I enjoyed the walk. There were some nice views of the city, and I got some good exercise. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933274" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_6658486_24933274.jpg" /></a>
<br />I figured I'd try to fit in and speak French. At a coffee shop at one of the metro stations, I said: &quot;Bonjour, Café Sil-vous-plais&quot;. She replied: &quot;What size?&quot;
<br />That evening, we went to a sports bar downtown. Across from the Bell Center, or Centre Bell. That is where the Canadiens pretend to play hockey. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933545" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_13029282_24933545.jpg" /></a>Anyway, we had some fantastic wings, and I had a cheese burger. The burger was $12, but it was the best burger I ever ate.  It was spiced and cooked just right, and had just the right balance of toppings. That’s one thing about Montréal, you will never have a bad meal in a restaurant. 
<br /><br />Date 28, 07, year 2009:
<br />Last day. We took a walk though the old part of the city and downtown. There are still some streets that are made from bricks, and some very nice buildings. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/paulbrec/photo/photoid=24933604" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/tt/7977370_7057684_24933604.jpg" /></a>We found this little whole-in-the-wall that was a hot dog stand. They had counter seating. A hot dog was $1.25. It was nothing special, but would be great for people downtown who just want to grab a quick, inexpensive lunch.
<br />At 17:30, I had to grab the bus back to Toronto. I wanted to stay another day, but I was booked on that bus with a non-refundable ticket. 
<br />The trip home wasn’t  as crowded, because VIA had gone back to work. Coming home by bus that evening helped me understand why most people prefer to take the train. It started to rain, just as we entered Ontario, and traffic on the 401 was very slow. In addition to the regular stop in Kingston, we had to stop in Belleville. Belleville? Who lives in Belleville? That added another 30 minutes onto an already long trip. We finally reached Toronto after 1:00. I was home by 2:00, and very tired. 
<br /><br />Travel Log Summary:
<br />I had a great time. I would like to go back next year. However, I will allow a higher budget so I could stay longer. You really need 5 full days to enjoy it. Also, depending on the fare, I will consider taking VIA Rail instead of the bus.

<br />I was in court today. Reason: Ontario Trasspassing Act.
<br />Here is the story. Way back in September, I was acused of entering Ontario Place (A goverment operated park) without paying, and that someone asked me to leave, and I didn't. They tried to fine me $70. I refused to pay, saying that I had payed and no one asked me to leave.
<br />The case finnally came to court today. The Crown Procecutor took me outside with Provincial Officers from Ontario Place to talk. Well, that isn't fair. Where is my representation? Anyway, I told her that nobody asked me to leave, and she said, &quot;I don't beleive you&quot;. Then she proceed to tell me that I didn't know anything about the law. So, suddenly, this person knows everything about me. Then she said, &quot;You are not taking the seriously&quot;. Well, no I'm not. This is a joke. How can the province justify taking something like this to court? What a waste of resources. Then she said to the Officers, &quot;We have a problem with this case. We do not have any proof that anyone asked him to leave.&quot; I just said that you dumb bitch! You didn't beleive me. So, in addition to taking this stupid thing to court, the Procecutor already knew there was diddly-squat she could do!  So, why are we wasting my time, and taxpayer's money, dragging this stupid case into court?  Needless to say, they had to withdrawl my case, which I already knew they would do. Out of the ten cases that were heard that day, seven were withdrawn.
<br />Tell me this isn't a waste? People wait two or three hours in an Emergeny Room for service, because hospitals in Ontario are under-funded, but they have planty of money for this crap!
