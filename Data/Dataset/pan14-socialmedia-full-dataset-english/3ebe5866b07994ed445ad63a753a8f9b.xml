<br /><br />There are many verses in scripture that give the believer a sense of safety and security. These verses in Psalms is especially prominent in the life of a Christian. Our belief values are somewhat based on our belief that God will take care of us, threw the tough times. But this is not nor should it be our primary reason to believe. Our belief system begins with the Birth, Death, Resurrection and Assention of Jesus, as Both Lord and Christ, the Son of God. We start out believing that Jesus is the Son of God and it grows from there to believe as we are taught. When a Christian is in trouble, there is no need to call upon man to help first, but rather we are commanded by Christ to call upon the name of the Lord.
<br /><br />Psa 37:25-32; I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken(Deserted; left; abandoned.), nor his seed begging bread. There is no time, that the believers in Christ, are left alone. The Devourer is on the prowl, looking for a young lamb to destroy. Can you ever think of a time when you saw a Christian going hungry? I mean really hungry? Hunger is something different to different people. The Bible tells us that what ever condition that we find ourselves in, there with be content. “There with” is stating that if you are in a state of riches, be content with what you have, if you find yourself poor, be content, if you find yourself with a set of cloths and a piece of bread, be content.
<br /><br />Our contentment with our present state is pivotal to being rewarded by God. We are there by showing that we are willing to accept the state or destiny that God has designed for us. If we cannot be content with food and clothing we are unable to accept or control greater riches or position in this life.
<br /><br />He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed. When we become believers in Christ, we are separated from the world , become a new creature and have been sealed to the everlasting Father. Now if your friends and family can give you food, clothing and shelter, weather being a Christian or not, how much more do you think God can give and how much more that He loves you? The Love of God is endless, as far as His Children is concerned. “his seed is blessed.” This is what we must believe. Our time of total acceptance of God and His word is now, today, while today is still called today. Are we the seed of God, the seed of Abraham? Then we must start acting as Kings and Priest, we must become the children of God. Being faithful, if only with a few things, accepting our Son-ship and being totally dependent upon God. (Mat 25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.)
<br /><br />Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. In 2nd Co 8:2-4, we see that poverty is not uncommon within the Church, as far back as the Churches at Macedonia, we see that God knew of their state and they were content with it. This is where their power was centered. The blessings of God start coming when we begin 1. believing and 2. When we become content with what He supply's to us. “How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
<br /><br />For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
<br /><br />” Let me ask you a question.”Does your coffers must need to be full before you can say that you are blessed by God? Lets read, 1Ti 6:5-8, and understand; “Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
<br /><br />But godliness with contentment is great gain.
<br /><br />For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
<br /><br />And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.” You argue that, “There are others that have plenty and we have nothing, is this a show of love from the one we believe in?” My answer is what Jesus stated to Peter, one of the other disciples, and what God told the world; John 21:21-22; Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. “what is that to thee?”
<br /><br />Deu 29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. The things that are ours, are the insight and understanding, not of what takes place to many who believe, but rather as to what the scriptures mean. Many things that we do not understand, belong to God and to Him only. We cannot say to the one who created us,”What are you doing?”
<br /><br />Job 33:11-14; He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.(God allows many things to afflict His Children, a sort of Chastisement, that takes a believer father than they ever imagined to go.
<br /><br />Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
<br /><br />For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
<br /><br />And this last verse explains it all; Dan 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
<br /><br />For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
<br /><br />The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
<br /><br />The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
<br /><br />The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
<br /><br />The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
<br /><br />Don't be dismayed by the state that you find yourself. God is all knowing and all caring. He know what His children need and desire. He know when one is hungry or saddened by events that are taking place around them. When hunger comes, manna is sent, when one is naked, cloths appear when one is down hearted, one is sent to assure joy in their life. Remember that, “The Joy of the Lord is my Strength.” So have Joy in the Lord and He will take care of you. ars.

<br />The quality of an action which renders it good; the conformity of an act to the divine law, or to the principles of rectitude.                                                  This conformity implies that the act must be performed by a free agent, and from a motive of obedience to the divine will.                                              This is the strict theological and scriptural sense of morality. 
<br /><br />Morality cannot be forced on any one, this is contrary to scripture.        Mankind has a choice, to live a moral life, or to ignore just, and moral ways, to become just another person in a vast network of unrighteousness.         Many hate the Christian lifestyle because we are, (as it is written.) a peculiar people, separated from the lust and pride that envelops this world.
<br /><br />&quot;Morals are subjective to individuals and should be examined and concluded for themselves.&quot;                                                                                            This is true, but with each decision come a responsibility to accept its consequences. To Live in Christ or to die in sin, that is our moral choice.
<br /><br />Mankind's idea, and concept, of morality falls very short of that delivered in the gospel.
<br />The man being the head of the house is commanded by the Lord to raise up his children in the fear and submission to the Lord, being His creation.            A man must know what moral ideas and attributes that his children shall have as they progress into manhood. 
<br /><br />For as it is written; “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.” 
<br />also;
<br />“(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />” 
<br /><br />Moral judgments are not the result of being born, but are learned.                  A man that does not teach what morality is to his family is guilty of withholding vital information. The choice that children make in life are a result of these teachings.                                                                                Lets take an example; A man doesn't tell a child that stealing to wrong and that child becomes a thief, another, a man doesn't tell a child that homosexuality is an abomination to God, and will never be acceptable to their own family. Are these things a teaching of morals, or just opinions? 
<br /><br />A mans responsibility to his household; 
<br />“And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”
<br />Morality in scripture is mentioned by the words;”Wisdom and Knowledge.”
<br />“The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.” 
<br /><br />Let us read the responsibility of truth and morality;
<br />“Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. 
<br />For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
<br />For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 
<br />He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. 
<br />Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
<br />Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. 
<br /><br />Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. 
<br />Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. 
<br />She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.” 
<br /><br />Get wisdom, get understanding, these are the tools for choices in morality. Without these, moral choices will cause grief and discord within the home and within the way a man sees the world, and how the world sees the man. 
<br />“she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.”                      Moral choices are a two edged sword. On the one hand they will(according to scripture.) bring honour to the man, but on the other hand (Ignoring the laws of Good Doctrine.) will bring about shame and dishonour.
<br /><br />Moral choices by many today in the way they live, has brought about much controversy and hatred to them.                                                         Homosexuality and same sex marriage are the two most prominent today. 
<br />These two moral choices have divided many a nation and peoples.          These moral choices are an abomination to God, and are listed as lifestyles that will not enter into the kingdom of Heaven.                                                      But these are moral choices.                                                                              If a man desires to choose to live in these manners, he accepts the consequences for his actions.                                                                           
<br /><br />The problem lies with, how a man, who adopts children, teaches these children about morality. 
<br />In the Bible a man that does not know the truth, cannot teach the truth, so therefore, the moral choices taught by these men cannot be considered as truths, but as a choice of immorality. 
<br /><br />Can man dictate morality, can man force others to accept moral choices being contrary to what a man believes? 
<br />The answer is simple, No. 
<br />The Bible is clear on these things. 
<br />For as it is written; 
<br />“Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.” 
<br /><br />Think about these words when making moral choices. Ars.

		<document id="f43d02830d32f264878db0ec6179aa6" url=""><![CDATA[To Shed Blood<br/><br/>Everything you see, in this life, blood has been shed, from the car you drive, to the cloths you wear, and even to the food that you eat.
<br /><br />Some where, at some moment, blood was shed, from the blood of a coal miner, to the steal worker, to the delievery driver.
<br /><br />We will speak of the salvation of man, where again, blood was shed. The Bible tells us that, without the sheading of blood there is no remission of sin.
<br /><br />Many people disreguard the blood that was shead for their salvation from Jesus. This blood removed the vail that covered the mercy seat and exposed all men to their sin and shame. This blood gave all men the oppertunity to be saved, only if they are washed in the blood of this perfict sacrificial lamb.
<br /><br />Let us read and understand;
<br /><br />&quot;But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle(A place of worship; a sacred place.), not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
<br /><br />Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained(Gained; procured; acquired.) eternal redemption( In theology, the purchase of God's favor by the death and sufferings of Christ; the ransom or deliverance of sinners from the bondage of sin and the penalties of God's violated law by the atonement of Christ.) for us.
<br /><br />For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth(To cleanse from corruption; to purify from sin; to make holy be detaching the affections from the world and its defilements, and exalting them to a supreme love to God.) to the purifying of the flesh:
<br /><br />How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge(To remove what is offensive; to sweep away impurities.) your conscience(Internal or self-knowledge, or judgment of right and wrong; or the faculty, power or principle within us, which decides on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of our own actions and affections, and instantly approves or condemns them.) from dead works to serve the living God?&quot;
<br /><br />Many religions do not speak of salvation nor the cleansing of the concience or spirit, from the sinful nature of man. Sin is an inherited spirit we all have from the fall of Adam.(First Adam.)
<br /><br />Without purification from sin, there can be no justification nor salvation for any man, us being all born in the flesh. All men are born into the likeness of sinful flesh and all must be reborn in the spirit, only threw the acceptance of Jesus as the Son of God and the renewing of mind and spirit, threw the sacrificial blood, can these things be done.
<br /><br />Do we discount the blood shed by Christ, as nothing, being selfrightious? Can we enter into rightiousness by the sheading of unpure blood, the killing of the innocent, the blood of scrificial animals, or the blood sheading for Gods sake?
<br /><br />For as it is written,
<br /><br />&quot;Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
<br /><br />And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.&quot;
<br /><br />Mans attempt to offer up blood of the innocent is tainted and unwanted by God. This is an abomination to the Lord and He will recompence blood for blood, in the time of the judgment and the terrable day of His vengence. For what other blood can be shead for the sins of man? What other blood can sustain man in a time of tribulations? What other blood can give life and give it more abuntantly than the blood of Christ?
<br /><br />For as Jesus stated; &quot;For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;And almost all things are by the law purged(Purified; made clean; healed.) with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.&quot;
<br /><br />Many believe that Jesus was a prophet from God, a Holy Man, but they discount His sheading of blood for the sanctification, justification and the covering of all manner of sin. Many celebrait the birth and death of Christ, not knowing Him nor the Father. They forget how He died for them, the stripes that He endured, the blood spilling, and flesh being torn, for them. They forget the shame and dishonour He suffered and how the blood that spilt fell upon the Holy Seat, fulling the past(The Law) and opening up the future.(The New Testiment.(Covenant.)
<br /><br />&quot;Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;.&quot;
<br /><br />How arrogant are men who say,&quot;God had no need of a Son&quot;, how conceited are they that try to dictate to the Lord what He can, and cannot do, how dare they spit upon this Holy Blood that God offered to the salvation of every man.
<br /><br />Are we to ignore this blood, are we to seek out other sacrifices, are we to ignore all common sence and reason, to climb into the kingdom of the Lord another way?
<br /><br />Just remember, Everything you see, in this life, blood has been shed.
<br /><br />Many people disreguard the blood that was shead for their salvation from Jesus, are you one of these? ars.

<br /><br />“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.”
<br /><br />The Lord is our Father, and we are His Children.
<br /><br />As a baby the Lord teaches us to crawl, as we learn, we are given His hand to stand and He teaches us to walk. This is with all men who are born of woman.
<br /><br />As we start our walk with the Lord He holds onto us firmly until we are able to walk on our own. He continues to walk beside us, and guide us, into the paths that He has chosen.
<br /><br />Man, who is still in the flesh, is distracted by many things. His curiosity takes over as he decides to see what this world has to offer. In this valley we begin to see dark clouds forming upon the horizon. The Lord decides to allow you to walk alone in front of Him to see what you will do in times of adversity. As we continue to walk, the sky grows darker, we hear the dogs howling, and the bats flying past a clouded moon.
<br /><br />We hear the wolves, the roar of the Lion, and Jackal, we see in the darkness the bright eyes of mysterious creatures, not knowing what they are. Our hearts grow faint, our legs weaken, and we start to run. Our strength is taken away from us, and we stumble, just as we are about to fall, the hand of the Lord reaches down, and catches us. He teaches us of the terrible things and shows us what we were so afraid of. Our strength returns, and we continue our walk with God.
<br /><br />What do you fear?
<br /><br />“For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
<br /><br />I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
<br /><br />Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.”
<br /><br />Is it sorrows that brings fear to you? Is it the burdens of this life that make you weak? Is it the terrors of mans inhumanity that cause you to lie awake at night?
<br /><br />Our life is full of uncertainties, but we know that these things will come upon all men, weather they serve the Lord, or not. Don't you remember that we are in the world, but not of the world? That the just and the unjust shall have the rain to fall upon both, and the sun shall rise upon both?
<br /><br />“In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
<br /><br />Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;” Many of the unrighteousness acts of man occur by the light of the moon, the darkness, committing the hidden things that we cannot see. These are the eyes that shine in the darkness, the wolves, the roar of the Lion, and Jackal, the bright eyes of mysterious creatures, that have been uncovered, and we know now what they are.
<br /><br />Thieves roam at night, taking what is not lawfully theirs. Those that seek the blood of the innocent also roam at night, seeking, as Satan does, whom they can devour. We lock our doors, and are afraid to walk the night streets because of these Jackals and snakes.
<br /><br />No need to fear.
<br /><br />“Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.
<br /><br />For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,
<br /><br />Say ye not, A confederacy(The friendships of the world are oft confederacies in vice.), to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy(A league, or covenant; a contract between two or more persons, bodies of men or states, combined in support of each other, in some act or enterprise; mutual engagement<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
<br /><br />Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.”
<br /><br />Many things shall come upon the righteous, but we are not to fear. Man has made a confederacy among themselves, some to commit acts of terror, fear, robbery, murder, thefts, and even war. Many have caused famine by their confederacy of greed and power. Many times an act of charity goes without thanks, for the receivers of this charity, takes what is given them, and it is sold.
<br /><br />As it is written; “At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<br /><br />I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.”
<br /><br />What fear can man bring upon you that would cause you to abandon the safety of the Lord? We know that the wisdom of man is foolishness to God, and Gods weakness is stronger than man.
<br /><br />Man is a weak thing, made of only flesh and bone. If I am cut, do I not bleed, if I am beaten, do my limbs not break. Who then is stronger than the Lord? Is man not His creation, or do you believe that man created God?
<br /><br />Again as it is written;“The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”
<br /><br />“When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<br /><br />Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
<br /><br />A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.”
<br /><br />No army, nor confederacy, nor Jackal, or snake, can harm you, if the Lord is by your side. The fearful and abominable shall flee at the presence of the Lord. Famine shall not touch His Children, nor shall nakedness appear among those that believe. Sickness and death will be only a passing thing among the Children of the Most High.
<br /><br />You are Kings and Priest before the Lord, a co-inheritor to the Kingdom of Heaven threw Jesus Christ. Stand tall, fear not, show your faith, our Lord will return.
<br /><br />Ars.

<br /><br />In the Bible the word;  “Anti-Christ” is mentioned 4 times.                              To understand these days we live in we must understand this spirit and man of anti-Christ.
<br /><br />The spirit of anti-Christ is AntiChris'tian;
<br />Pertaining to antichrist; opposite to or opposing the christian religion.
<br />A follower of antichrist; one opposed to the christian religion.
<br /><br />Pertaining to antichrist, this Spirit entices, or seduces, the unlearned and unprotected individual, this also includes whole nations and principalities. That which hath power or energy; the quality of any substance which manifest life, activity, or the power of strongly affecting other bodies.       This spirit of anti-Christ has power, not over the body, but over the mind of many. 
<br /><br />“The copy has not the spirit of the original.”                                                   This pertaining to the anti-Christ being a copy of the original spirit that Jesus left with us, to lead us and guide us into all truths.                                                 This copy cat spirit has not the interest of man nor of God in mind, but of a tearing down of the truth in the world, in other words, to kill, steal and destroy all that is holy. 
<br /><br />The spirit of man includes; 
<br />The renewed nature of man.  
<br /> An immaterial intelligent substance.                                                               Spirit is a substance in which thinking, knowing, doubting, and a power of moving do subsist.                                                                                           Hence, An immaterial intelligent being.                                                        This being the part of man, that controls the actions of the body and the thoughts of the heart.(Soul.)
<br /><br />“Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.” 
<br />This verse is concerning the spirit of the antichrist, being separate from, but also being equal to, the embodiment of the physical man.
<br />Before Jesus started to preach the new covenant to all men, this spirit came in opposition to His teachings.                                                                               The first bold mention of anti-Christ in the New Testament, was at the temptation of Christ.(Matthew 4:1-10.)
<br /><br />In today's world we have noticed a change from the principles that this country was founded upon and the teachings of God.                                   We have seen many laws, statutes and rhetoric being leveled at the Christian life style and the falling away from the bind that ties Israel and us.              We are being told in the media that Israel and Christianity are the two main causes of  discord around the world.                                                                            We have been told by our very leaders that this nation is no longer a Christian Nation, but a multi ethnic, multi religious society, becoming the largest Muslim nation in the world, this is the spirit of anti-Christ, deceiving.                                                                          This spirit that we can all see, if we are willing to look, is trying to control the minds of men and separate many from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<br /><br />“Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.”                                                                      We see here that this spirit of anti-Christ denies' both the Father and the Son. He is being led not by the spirit of God but rather, his father, the devil.                    Many people do not even know that this spirit exist, nor do they comprehend his power over the mind.                                                                                People today have gone astray from the Godly principles of a good life style and have become indulgent in the pleasing of the flesh, and the pride of life. The spirit of anti-Christ, nor Satan, cares what lie you believe, just so you believe that Jesus doesn't exist. 
<br /><br />“And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.” 
<br />Would this spirit of anti-Christ have been stopped by Christ? No.                         The Bible tells us that this spirit, and the man himself, shall be destroyed in the end days, being allowed to fulfill Biblical prophecy.                                             God has given us signs and warnings, that should let every man know when the end of days are here.                                                                                  Many refuse to believe and therefore, this spirit is still with us. So long as this spirit deceives people, he is still strong in his resolve to destroy many souls, and the lives of man. 
<br /><br />“For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.” 
<br />These deceivers are false religions, false prophets, and even government leaders, that are deceiving and being deceived by this spirit.                            When we see any man say that Christianity is a deterrent to peace, this is the spirit being manifested threw him.                                                                       These deceivers reject the very notion of Christ, the very idea of loving your neighbor as yourself, and the intent of forgiveness of sins, threw the belief in Jesus being the Son of God. 
<br /><br />“And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. 
<br />Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 
<br />For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” 
<br /><br />Many Christians will be called home before they are allowed to fall for this spirit of lies. Many shall be made stronger to withstand this spirit, and will, as Jesus stated, be hated by the world, persecuted and even killed for their testimony of Christ. Many today are calling for the removal of any reference to God, Christ, and even the cross from public display, this also is the spirit of anti-Christ being manifested. Why cannot the populace of this world see these signs? 
<br />They have eyes, and cannot see, they have ears, and refuse to hear, and they have mouths that spout filth, and lies, against the most High God.                 This also being a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.                                              Many do not realize that their hatred of Christ is fulfillment of prophecy, for we, believers and unbelievers, are all tied together in this Biblical prophecy. 
<br />Think about it. Ars.

<br /><br />Many people are walking threw this life not finding pleasure nor an open door of compassion. Many are looking for something that will take away the pain of living. We all, at one time or another have been in this state, but we have found a release from this life of misery and pain, we have found a direction and an open door.
<br /><br />The Fire;
<br />Trouble; affliction.
<br />To set on fire, to kindle; to inflame; to excite violent action.
<br /><br />“I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:” 
<br /><br />This baptism spoken of in Matthew 3;11, is denoting a baptism of the spirit that is able to endure hardships and tribulation. Jesus warned us that we would be hated and tried, that being a follower would not be an easy task but that His yoke is easy and His burdens light. 
<br /><br />The burdens of mankind, without Christ are heavy, this is where we see many people walking threw this life not finding pleasure, nor an open door of compassion. This is a miserable way to live. 
<br />We all, at one time or another have been in this state, but we have found a release from this life of misery and pain, we have found a direction and an open door.
<br /><br />The burdens that Christ spoke of was the burdens of carrying the Gospel, living what we testify to and walk as we ask others to walk.
<br /><br />Barnes states of these verses; The Rivers;(High Waters.) This is a general promise, and means that whenever and wherever they should pass through water or fire, he would protect them.
<br />“When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt.” 
<br />“When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.” 
<br />The Fire; This is expressive of calamity and danger in general like passing through fire. 
<br /><br />Gods protection falls upon those that believe in Him and believe upon His Son Jesus. Without protection from the fires and floods, men have no recourse but to endure the best that they can. This is where many will enter into depression and even co-mitt suicide. This world brings many burdens upon mankind, job loss, family disputes, debt, even pressure from government, bosses and every wind and doctrine that others place on them.
<br /><br />“As the Lord states of the unbeliever;  Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. 
<br /> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” 
<br /><br />The Shadow.
<br /><br />Shadow; To overspread with obscurity. terrible darkness, trouble or death. (Speaking of Sin.)
<br />Sin is an Inseparable companion to all men at one time or another. Even those who are rich are still a companion and slave to sin ans Satan. Without the Lord, all men live in a shadow, and all men live in the shadow of death, for it will come to all mankind.
<br /><br />Those of us who have accepted Christ as our savior, have learned, threw Him and the words of the Lord, to walk threw these shadows and even the fires of life. They are nothing but shadows, lies and ghosts of deception.
<br /><br />The Lord states of these shadows;
<br />“For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord God of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.” 
<br /><br />“There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.” 
<br />“Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?” 
<br /><br />“Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
<br />For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 
<br />Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 
<br />Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned(To despise; to consider and treat as mean and despicable; to scorn.)
<br /> the counsel of the most High: 
<br />Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.” 
<br /><br />Mankind, even with all his troubles, still rebel against the Lord and His truth. They are prying the gates of Hell open for themselves, so they may enter. They have blinded themselves so they cannot see, and hardened their hearts so they cannot be saved. Their labour is heavy and their pleasures are an abomination. They kill each other with words and guns, not regarding life. 
<br />They despise the righteous and hate the believers.

<br />Vanity of the sinner. 
<br />“For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 
<br />There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.” 
<br /><br />Death comes to all the wicked and the righteous.  As we look threw Ecclesiastes we see that this date of our demise is not known to any man.
<br />For man, no matter weather he be rich or poor, bond or free, will not delay his death by any means.(There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> For only God can control death and life. (neither hath he power in the day of death<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />There is no man that can stop his death,(neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.) for he has no control of it, nor can he say to the Lord, I have been good, so let me not die.(and there is no discharge in that war<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Can death then be delayed? 
<br />Yes but only for the righteous as stated in Deuteronomy 4:40.  
<br />“Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.”
<br />But for the wicked there is no place in this blessing. For they do not keep the commandments of the Lord and neither do they believe in Him.
<br /><br />“All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.” 
<br />Mans life comes and goes, his legacy will endure but for a short time, and then he will be forgotten. I have seen this many times, in just my short life time. Mans glory is fleeting and short lived. One day the world loves him and the next the world finds someone else to adore. 
<br />“But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.” 
<br /><br />Where is mans glory when he enters into the grave? Where is mans power, his riches, and his prominence, when the worms consume the carcase?
<br />Does the grave say to man, “I remember you. I remember your power, your glory and your prominence upon the earth. What shall you ask me to do?
<br />Shall I make your death easier, better, shall I make the grave not cold, not so dark, or your stay shortened?
<br />“And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.” 
<br /><br />The wicked are consumed by themselves, their fall from grace is of their own doing, and there is none to aid them. The Lord has called, and the wicked would not answer, the Lord has ask to save them, but they refused His salvation. Will the sentence against the evil worker be executed speedily? Will the Lords last call for them bring down deserved punishment? 
<br />No, for a man has a time to live, and a time to die. 
<br />His time must be exhausted and then his punishment shall come and will not delay. 
<br />“Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
<br />Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:” 
<br /><br />The wicked may be a bond servant to the righteous and the righteous may be bond servant to the wicked, but the Lord knows who belongs to Him. 
<br />The righteous and the wicked work together, inhabit the same space, breath the same air, eat the same food, and drink the same water. 
<br />The wicked and the righteous share in the same coming of the dawn, and the falling of the night. The sun shines on both, the rain causes both to become wet, and the drought effects both, the stars of the heavens know not which is which, and shine as the Lord commands, but after, this is where the separation comes. 
<br />“There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.” 
<br /><br />From the wicked comes, all evil done under the sun. 
<br />Rape, murder, theft, incest, and doctrines of devils. 
<br />Not knowing righteousness, nor the Lord. 
<br />Men seek their own and another mans possessions and power. 
<br />They seek only to satisfy themselves without regard to the hurt done to others and no regard to their delayed punishment. 
<br />You say; ”I've done none of these things, why then should I believe in God? Will He, if He exist,  punish me also?”
<br />Without Christ, He will punish, at His time of choosing. 
<br />For without faith it is impossible to please God. You must remember that all unrighteousness is punishable. 
<br />A liar is punished as a murderer, for there is not respect of person with the Lord. 
<br />All unrighteousness is sin, all unbelievers in Christ are included in unrighteousness. 
<br /><br />“Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. 
<br />When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.”
<br /><br />Repentance is the only way to avoid this Delayed Punishment. Ars.

<br />Dear Lord, we know that those that hasten to be by your side, know and the end is near. We know Lord that your name shall last forever. 
<br />The days are growing shorter, and the end is near. 
<br />Please keep your children safe, with power in the Holy Ghost, with faith, hope, and endurance, for the things that will be coming down upon this earth. 
<br /><br />Let every creature that has breath, praise you for your excellent greatness, for as your word states;
<br />&quot;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&quot; In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
<br /><br />Biblical understanding.
<br /><br />The end of days are upon us. 
<br />The wicked are doing all manner of wickedness. 
<br />Those that are unsaved, or those that have the spirit of anti-Christ, are calling good, evil, and evil, good. 
<br />They call unrighteousness normal, and acceptable, and the righteousness of believers persecution and bigotry. 
<br />We are who we are by the grace of God. 
<br />We know that Heavens gates are open to all who believe, for they are beautiful, and hell is open to all who refuse to believe in Jesus, as the Christ. Heavens gates, or Hells fury, that is the only choices. 
<br />Let us read and understand.
<br /><br />Daniel.
<br />Many shall be purified, and made white(Saved), and tried(put under pressure from the unrighteous.); but the wicked shall do wickedly(Sin will abound.): and none of the wicked shall understand(The truth and results of their actions.); but the wise shall understand.(The saved.) 
<br />And from the time [that] the daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away(A law will be established to stop animal sacrifices.), and the abomination that maketh desolate set up(Statue of the anti-Christ.), [there shall be] a thousand two hundred and ninety days.(The time that the law is established and the statue is put in the Holy place.) 
<br /><br />Blessed [is] he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.(those that refuse the mark of the beast and those that refuse to worship the anti-Christ.) But go thou thy way till the end [be](Go about your business.): for thou shalt rest(Die in the Lord.), and stand in thy lot(The side of the righteous.) at the end of the days.(Judgment.)  
<br /><br />The days are full of news that correspond to the prophecy's of the end of time. This news has worried the Christian family, for there are so many that are still lost. We, as believers, have no fear of these changes we see, but rather we are encouraged the more to hold on to our faith, and hope, in the sustaining power of God. 
<br /><br />We hear of changes in the world governments changing attitudes over corrupt doctrine and false gods. They are asking the populace to accept and embrace these anti-Christian doctrines. &quot;There will be peace and safety&quot;, they say, but as surly as the Bible states, &quot;They shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction shall come upon them.&quot;
<br /><br />The spirit of anti-Christ is upon us. He is going about marking those that are in his control. 
<br />&quot;And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. 
<br />He that is unjust(acting contrary to the standard of right established by the divine law; not equitable; as an unjust man.), let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy( Dirty; foul; unclean; nasty.
<br /> Polluted; defiled by sinful practices; morally impure.), let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous(it denotes one who is holy in heart, and observant of the divine commands in practice; as a righteous man.), let him be righteous still: and he that is holy( We call a man holy,when his heart is conformed in some degree to the image of God, and his life is regulated by the divine precepts. Hence, holy is used as nearly synonymous with good, pious, godly.), let him be holy still.  
<br />And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward [is] with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.&quot;
<br />Many men are unjust. 
<br />The laws have been changed according, not to righteousness, but rather to popular opinion and public pressure. 
<br />We are seeing many of todays leaders changing the truth of decency into a state where all unrighteous is created equal to the laws of good judgment. 
<br /><br />Many men are filthy.
<br />The Bible, when using the word man, includes male and female, for there is no difference with God.
<br /><br />&quot;Without natural affection,

<br /><br />“And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. 
<br />Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;”
<br /><br />What power does the Christian have over the things that come against them? We are all the same in the sight of God, there is no male nor female. We are seen in only two states, the first is in first Adam, where all are under sin and corruption. The second is Last Adam, where we are attributed and have salvation threw Jesus Christ.  
<br /><br />In these last days the church has gotten away from the source of our power. Many are going astray from the truth of who they are, and have accepted many false doctrines of devils. 
<br />The spirit of anti-Christ is running rampant, seducing and deceiving many who are week in their power to resist. 
<br />We cannot accept things that are contrary to scripture no matter what the reason given. 
<br />We cannot be partaker of the sins of the world. 
<br />For this reason many have lost the power to heal, convert and bring forth a true testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are too many names of the church doors, too many doctrines and too many wrong interpretations of scripture. 
<br /><br />Remember this verse?
<br />“Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.”
<br />Many today have denied the scriptures as they are written. Many have dulled their ears to the truth and have gone away after what they have been taught by mans doctrines. I have run into this many times.  We see a denial of the scriptures concerning our power to heal, speak in other tongues and wisdom and knowledge that brings our power to full intensity. These verses are located in  1Corrinthians 12:4-10.
<br /><br />Let us break down the meaning of a few words. 
<br />“And there are differences(A logical distinction.) of administrations(dispensation; distribution; exhibition), but the same Lord. 
<br />And there are diversities(Difference; dissimilitude; unlikeness.) of operations(The act or process of operating; agency; the exertion of power, physical, mechanical or moral.),
<br /> but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 
<br />But the manifestation(The act of disclosing what is secret, unseen or obscure; discovery to the eye or to the understanding; the exhibition of anything by clear evidence; display; as the manifestation of God's power in creation, 
<br />or of his benevolence in redemption.) 
<br />of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.” 
<br /><br />The act of disclosing what is secret, unseen or obscure, is our power within this Gospel that we all are tied to, and believe. Without the gifts of the spirit, how can we understand the Gospel, how can we share wisdom, knowledge and understanding with others. Our power lies not in us, but within us as believers in the word written for our own salvation. 
<br /><br />“For to one is given by the Spirit the word(Declaration; affirmation.) of wisdom(The right use or exercise of knowledge); to another the word of knowledge(Learning; illumination of mind. Ignorance is the curse of God, knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.) 
<br />by the same Spirit;” 
<br /><br />As you see here, wisdom and knowledge is a gift from the Holy Spirit.     These gifts are given by Him according to His will.                                        Wisdom and knowledge are two different things.                                                   Man has knowledge of many things but it takes wisdom to make true use of it.  We all have a certain amount of knowledge of the scripture, but without the wisdom to understand, and then use what we know, is vital to our power as Christians. Many miracles are not preformed today because many have gotten away from the power, the wisdom that it takes to use knowledge to preform such acts. 
<br /><br />Do not be disheartened, for as it is written in prophecy, these things will, and are, taking place.                                                                                                         We see many have not this gift and others do.                                                    Here is where we must seek out those with these gifts to help us to understand what we read.  
<br /><br />“To another faith(Belief; the assent of the mind to the truth of what is declared by another, resting on his authority and veracity, without other evidence; the judgment that what another states or testifies is the truth. ) by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
<br />To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:” 
<br /><br />The gift of faith has been given to all. 
<br />This is also included in the gifts of the spirit. 
<br />But why do we all have this gift?  
<br />Faith is a substance(That which subsists by itself; that which subsists in and by another, is called a mode or manner of being.)
<br />, a possession(To take possession, to enter on, or to bring within one's power or occupancy.) 
<br />and a miracle( an event or effect contrary to the established constitution and course of things, or a deviation from the known laws of nature; a supernatural event.) within itself. Without faith it is impossible to please God. 
<br />Without faith we would never be saved and, without faith, how can we believe in Jesus? 
<br /><br />The discerning of spirits has been given to all.                                                         We are aware of false teachings, preachers, and doctrines, but as I have said before, if we do not use this power, we will fall into entrapment of lies and deception. You cannot say that the gifts of the spirit were only for the disciples of Christ and His apostles, for we are all so have been given these gifts. You may not understand them but they are there. If a gift isn't used it will be given to another. 
<br /><br />This part of the gifts have been misunderstood, and feared,  for years. “to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:” 
<br />The gift of tongues and their interpretation is available to all who desire to communicate this Gospel of life that Jesus brought to us. 
<br />I have used this gift to communicate to many people not of English origin. I can read, write, and even use verbal communication in spreading the Gospel. There is another gift of tongues that is given that a man can communicate with God, but not all, who say they have this gift actually have it. 
<br />There are many special gifts that are there if we ask for them but all in all it takes faith and trust in Gods word to achieve the impossible, for doesn't God make the impossible possible? 
<br /><br />Isnt it time that we all get back to the source of our power? Think about it.

Many christians today have no idea that there is prophecy of the three temples. Many even denigh the fact. But The temple mount is the center of all prophecy and conflict between the Isralies and Muslims. The Anti- Christ will put his image in the third temple and cause it to speak.
<br /><br />2Pe 2:1-3. “But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.”
<br /><br />Here is prophecy being fulfilled. The Israeli rabbinical council involved with re-establishing the Sanhedrin, is calling upon all groups involved in Temple Mount research to prepare detailed architectural plans for the reconstruction of the Jewish Holy Temple.[The Third Temple.] Muslims believe the Temple Mount is the place where Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, ascended to heaven. On the other hand, for Jews and Christians, the Temple Mount is the place where the Jewish temple once stood and is the &quot;center of spiritual and religious national aspirations of the Jews in Israel,&quot; [The Temple of Soloman.] 
<br /><br />In addition, the Temple Mount was where Jesus taught and overturned the moneychangers' tables. {Mat 21:12-13. And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, “It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.”}
<br /><br />The Sanhedrin is the name given in the mishna to the council of seventy-one Jewish sages who constituted the Supreme Court and legislative body in Judea during the Roman period. The make-up of the council included a president, vice president, and sixty-nine general members who all sat in the form of a semi-circle when in session. 
<br /><br />Though the majority of the membership of the 71-member &quot;new&quot; Sanhedrin remain anonymous, three out of seven members who have been selected to represent the body are leaders of the Temple Mount movement, an array of radical groups who advocate demolishing the Al-Aqsa Mosque to make way for a third temple in Jerusalem. Further, the &quot;new&quot; Sanhedrin has confirmed its place within the Temple Mount Movement by announcing its intention to take steps toward the rebuilding of the temple. 
<br /><br />Subscribers to the Temple Mount Movement believe that, by rebuilding of the Temple, they can usher in a Messianic Era of eternal peace.[ref. Dan_7:20-25, Dan_8:9-12; Rev_13:11-13]
<br />To understand better, we must turn to the Word of God.
<br />Dan 9:26-27. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 
<br /><br />And he[anti-christ] shall confirm the covenant with many for one week[7 years]: and in the midst of the week[3.5 years] he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the over-spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.
<br /><br />The Doomsday Factor that we see today is the struggle over the land promised by God to Israel thru, Moses, Aaron &amp; Abraham. “The threat of an attack by Jewish extremists on the Temple Mount is of great concern to Israeli security officials as Israel prepares to withdraw from Gaza, according to former Shin Bet head Avi Dichter. Security officials refer to the possibility as the &quot;doomsday scenario.&quot; An attack on the Temple Mount (Dome of The Rock) would be disastrous for Israel and the rest of the Christian world. Many would be killed, not only in Israel but the entire world. World War would break out.
<br />Here is Gods promise to Israel. 
<br /><br />Deu 11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. [ Ref; Gen_15:18-21; Exo_23:31; Num_34:3-15; Jos_1:3, Jos_1:4, Jos_14:9; 1Ki_4:21, 1Ki_4:24; 2Ch_9:26]
<br />2Pe 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; Zec 14:4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. 
<br /><br />2Pe 2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; Mat 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. Luke 21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Rev 11:18 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
<br /><br />Rev 13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. Rev 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
<br /><br />The end is coming, weather you believe or not. prophecy is being fulfilled and the doomsday factor has already started. Let me leave you with one last thought from Christ; ” I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?”

<br /><br />Many Ministers, of Gods Testimony, of His Son Jesus, are crying with bitter tears for the dead and the loss of many who have died without any hope of Salvation thru the rejection of the Blood of the Lamb. Atonement for them is far gone and is no longer available to them, whom have made their decision to follow false gods into eternity. These Ministers of the truth are not at fault for the lost that have died, but the fault lyes with those that chose darkness rather than light. Those who have died in sin must also be raised in sin to be partaker of the judgment of man. There is no fault in the ministers of truth, they have done their duty to God and man to deliver the truth. 
<br /><br />2Co 4:5 (Wesley) For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us. We preach not ourselves - As able either to enlighten, or pardon, or sanctify you. But Jesus Christ - As your only wisdom, righteousness, sanctification. And ourselves your servants - Ready to do the meanest offices. For Jesus' sake - Not for honor, interest, or pleasure. 
<br /><br />The Father hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son. The word “translated” has two specific meanings, 
<br />1.The translation of the body, as noted in scripture. To bear, carry or remove from one place to another. To remove or convey to heaven, as a human being, without death. “By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death. Heb 16.” 
<br />2. Translated as of the spirit. 
<br />Those thus translated as to state, are also transformed as to character. This is a change from the carnal mind to the mind of Christ. A change of attitude a change in your thought processes a change in heart. There are many that believe Col 1:12-14, is stating that Christians, who have been translated, are immune to attack by Satan and the forces of Darkness, this is a misconception and dangerous belief. 
<br /><br />The translation mentioned here is translation of the dead spirit to a live spirit and not the death of the body. A translation from a kingdom of lies and deception to the Kingdom of Light and Truth. From being a servant to Satan to the Servant of the Lord God Almighty. From being a slave to sin to being the Sons of God. So long as the Body is alive, it is a target for Satan and the kingdom of Darkness. Still don't believe? 
<br /><br />Look at Paul for example; 2Co 12:7-10; And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. Paul was a preacher to the gentiles, of which we all are. “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations” this passage is stating that Paul, to be kept Humble, as we are, was given a pest, to keep Him in Humbleness. 
<br /><br />The Word “revelations” was not the Book of Revelations, but spiritual insight into the truth of the Gospel. Paul states this twice, “lest I should be exalted above measure.” Thou we have all wisdom and knowledge into the scriptures we are all still living in this kingdom of darkness. John 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 2Co 4:3-4 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. I wish to look at, 2Co 4:3-4, for a moment, especially the words,”In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not” “the god of this world,” “ is Satan.” If we look in the book of Revelations, after the letters to the churches we see a pattern that is very troubling.
<br /><br />Starting with chapter 6 there is no mention of the Church until later in the prophecy's. This is troubling because if you noticed, even thou the prophecy's of revelations are still accessible to all, no one pays any attention to them. The Bible is still accessible but man, different from today, who are obsessed with prophecy, refuses to hear anymore of Scripture, or ignores it. Why? 1. The Church is Gone. The preaching of the gospel has changed course from the gentiles to the Jews, ergo the 144,000 sealed Jews. The times of the gentiles has been fulfilled. Which isn't to say that the gentiles cannot still repent but that prophecy must be fulfilled as it is written. 
<br /><br />Rev 11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. 
<br />2. The kingdom of darkness has taken hold world wide. Rev 11:10 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 
<br />3. Everyone is preoccupied with self preservation. Rev 6:15-17, And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? 
<br />4. Since man has rejected the truth, God has blinded them, so that they cannot see. 2Th 2:11-12 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
<br /><br />Rev 16:9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. In this statement,”Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness”, the word “power” is not in the Greek language but rather signifies, the ability of, Faculty of the mind, as manifested by a particular mode of operation; as the power of thinking, comparing and judging; the reasoning powers. “give commission” 
<br /><br />That is to mean, the ability to control our thinking, our mind and spirit. We have been translated from the control of the ways of darkness to the ways of Jesus Christ and His thinking. Righteousness and Goodness and Truth is the Kingdom of God. We have been delivered from the prince of darkness, [Satan] who, by means of sin and un-belief, keeps men in ignorance, vice, and misery. Has mankind become so blind that they cannot see? Have you also become blinded by the death and destruction of the past few years that Satan has also blinded your eyes to the truth of Biblical Prophecy? What are you seeking that Jesus cannot supply?

<br /><br />'To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.&quot; &quot;They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.&quot;
<br /><br />There are two types of famine in this world today, the first a famine for food and the second a famine for the word of God. Many countries are seeking aid from the richer countries to help them in their need for food, but this is not the cause of this type of famine. The cause is the paganism, the worship of false gods, and even to the worship of animals. The Lord will not provide for these people and will allow them to worship the gods they have chosen. We see an example of this with God and Israel.
<br /><br />“Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
<br /><br />Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.”
<br /><br />People have forsaken sound judgment and the word of God. They have rejected Jesus as the Son of God, and are now paying the terrible price for their acts. We see more warnings in the Bible concerning this matter.
<br /><br />“And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
<br /><br />Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.”
<br /><br />There are many that seek out the destruction of the Christian and the children of Israel. Why haven't they called upon their gods to strike us down, instead of trying to kill us off with bullets and bombs? Why haven't their gods taken over this world, why haven't they food and shelter, why haven't they conquered this world? The reason is that, Jews and Christians are interconnected with the living God Jehovah. Their false gods cannot hear, see nor speak. They cannot hear a prayer, see division, nor suffering, nor hear the cry's of hunger.
<br /><br />“See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
<br /><br />For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
<br /><br />If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
<br /><br />I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.”
<br /><br />God Jehovah is a God of peace and a God of war. There is no other God that can give life and take away their mortal soul. This is why the other gods cannot destroy the Christian or the Israeli's. We are made whole in Christ Jesus, we are fed when we are hungry, we are clothed when we are naked, and we are able to see when others are blind. The Lord has promised to keep us alive in famine, keep us from the hour of temptation and able to keep us from falling, when others try to confuse us.
<br /><br />The word of God is our strength and our foundation on which we build upon. There is no reason for any man to perish when he belongs to the Lord God. If God feeds the birds of the air, and the beast of the field, how much then should He take care of those that worship Him?
<br /><br />For as it is written;
<br /><br />&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
<br /><br />And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.&quot;
<br /><br />The Lords patience is long suffering for His creation, but all things come to an end. God has set His plan of salvation in motion, and the end days are here, this is the day of salvation, today is the day to come to Christ, but in these days of trouble and tribulation, the Lord shall cut off His Son from many. Many shall seek out the Lord and He will not be found. The reason for this is the worlds religions have corrupted minds, and souls, so far, that the Lord will no longer seek them out. When the deception is discovered by these men, it will be too late, the Lord will not be mocked.
<br /><br />Be not terrified of the things that we are seeing today. Many an earthquake are taking place, many try to calm the people saying that these things are normal, many try to say that the floods, earthquakes, fires and other catastrophes are things that this earth must go threw to clean itself. These are deceivers, lairs and prognosticators, not knowing and neither telling the truth.
<br /><br />“But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.
<br /><br />Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
<br /><br />And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
<br /><br />But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.
<br /><br />And it shall turn to you for a testimony.”

<br /><br />The Bible tells us that in the end days gold and silver prices shall drop to the point that they are worthless materials. What would cause such a drastic change in these values where by all financial institutions use them as an indicator of what paper currency is worth?
<br /><br />I have noticed a great assurgence in the buying and selling of Gold and silver, but just as the diamond prices are regulated by a few, Gold and silver is also regulated to a certain extent.
<br /><br />Lets take diamonds for the first example.
<br /><br />DeBears is the largest diamond producer that I know of. They regulate the price by assuring that only a select number are released upon the world market. But look what would happen to the price of diamonds if all the stockpiles around the world would hit the market at once.
<br /><br />As the sands of the seas, the diamonds would be worthless.
<br /><br />So shall be the value of gold and silver.
<br /><br />Let us read;
<br /><br />“And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<br />And the idols he shall utterly abolish.”
<br /><br />Loftiness;
<br /><br />Elevated in condition or character. Proud.
<br /><br />Haughtiness;
<br /><br />Proud and disdainful; having a high opinion of one's self, with some contempt for others; lofty and arrogant; supercilious.
<br /><br />“In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;”
<br /><br />Many of the precious stones that are coveted by man today, have in essence become idols to be worshipped. Idols can be anything that you put before the Lord. It is written that the love of money is the root of all evil and I have found that this is very true.
<br /><br />You can see that many rich and highly influential people, wear gold and silver constantly.
<br /><br />Gold fausetts, silver cufflinks, and what about diamonds, they show off their wealth and prosperity by the number and size of these stones.
<br /><br />What has caused the intrest of buying and selling gold today? It is fear, fear of the decline of all financial markets world wide. The fall of the stock exchange is not surpriseing but predictiable. When man decided to start calling evil, good, and good, evil, it was the time to watch for these changes. This world will not last forever, it has a begining and and end.
<br /><br />Common sense dictates that the more a man owns, the more he desires. He is not satisfied with his hoard of wealth, but will lie awake at night crafting many devices to lay hold of what others possess.
<br /><br />We see this in todays news, wallstreet, banks, credit card companies raising their interest rates to gain a foot hold into the every day life of the common man. As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and suffer for it.
<br /><br />There is coming a time that it will take a days wages, for those lucky enough to have a job, to pay for only the food that they eat.
<br /><br />So if this is coming to pass, what about home sales, automobile industries, manufacturing and other services that we’ve all come to rely upon?
<br /><br />They also shall fail. Who shall you turn too, the banks, the government or will you die of hunger and disease?
<br /><br />To bring about Gods profetic word, the manufacturing, financial and false religious orders around the world must fail. This has been the warning from Jesus, who spoke of hiding our treasures in Heaven.
<br /><br />“And he spoke a parable to them, saying, “The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
<br /><br />And he said,
<br /><br />This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?”
<br /><br />The financial institutions shall continue on a downward spiral, until all that they can take from the poor is exhausted. Will there be a great find of gold and silver to make them worthless? I do not know, but one thing is for certain, it will come to pass, so saith the Lord God.
<br /><br />“Cease you from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of ?”
<br /><br />Who are we to trust in? Banks and all financial institutions are steeling from the common man and the goverment is setting back and allowing this to happen. Shall you turn to God ansd His Christ or will you also take the mark of the Beast and enjoy sin for a season? The Choice is yours.
<br /><br />“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;”
<br /><br />Charge them that are rich] He had before, in 1Tim 6:1; 1Tim 6:9; 1Tim 6:10, given them a very awful lesson concerning their obtaining riches; and now he gives them one equally so concerning their use of them.
<br /><br />That they be not high-minded] That they do not value themselves on account of their wealth, for this adds nothing to mind or moral worth.
<br /><br />Nor trust in uncertain riches] (The uncertainty of riches; things which are never at a stay, are ever changing, and seldom continue long with one proprietor; therefore, as well as on many other accounts, they are not to be trusted in: they cannot give happiness, because they are not fixed and permanent; neither can they meet the wishes of an immortal spirit; but in the living God, who is the unchangeable fountain of perfection.”Clark)

<br /><br />There are many today that are arguing that, the Christian religion has taken on the part of the aggressor, and not the taim religion, that many believe it is. Christianity has become the most hated religion in the world second only to Judaism. The Jews and Christians are intertwined together, one cannot be separated from the other, for we are both brothers and sisters in Christ, we as believers in Jesus as the Messiah, and the Jews, waiting on Him. 
<br /><br />We are persecuted for our testimony of the words of God and His Christ.  
<br />The Ten Commandments, the prophecies, the abominations that Gods states will end in death, and the other words of the true God. 
<br />We are commanded by the Lord to testify of Him, and His Son.                         We are also commanded by the Lord to warn them that are unruly and those that are lost, that a judgment day is fastly approaching. 
<br /><br />“But if the watchman sees the sword,(death.), coming,(is at hand,near.), and does not blow the trumpet,
<br />(Warning.) and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes 
<br />a person from them, he is taken away in his iniquity,(that person shall die in their sins.); but his blood,(Life.), 
<br />I will require from the watchman's hand.”(To call to account for.) 
<br /><br />“When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.”
<br /><br />Wicked;
<br /><br />Evil in principle or practice; deviating from the divine law; addicted to vice; sinful; immoral. This is a word of comprehensive signification, extending to every thing that is contrary to the moral law, and both to persons and actions. The wicked, in Scripture, persons who live in sin; transgressors of the divine law; all who are unreconciled to God, unsanctified or impenitent.(Not repenting of sin; not contrite; obdurate; of a hard heart.)
<br /><br />In this instance the word,”Life.” refers not to the physical life, for all must die, but to the spiritual life, the soul.
<br /><br />The immorality of man has reached greater heights in these last days.
<br /><br />Many are looking for an easy way out of their sins, many even saying that permissive sex(having multiple partners.) is all a part of life, and their view of other religions are the same as Christianity, they all being deceived by their own lust.
<br /><br />Sin and unrighteousness, takes on many forms, from murder, rape, theft, to homosexuality, transgender lifestyles(&quot;Non-identification with, or non-presentation as, the sex (and assumed gender) one was assigned at birth.&quot; ), and same sex marriages.
<br /><br />But we are assured, by the Lord, that if we, as believers in Christ and His word, instruct these people of their error, we will not be held accountable for their rejection of the truth, as stated here;
<br /><br />“Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.”
<br /><br />Delivered; Freed; released; transferred or transmitted; passed from one to another; committed; yielded; surrendered; rescued; uttered; pronounced.
<br /><br />Of warning the righteous who sin willingly.
<br /><br />Again, “When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.”
<br /><br />I have yet to meet the perfect Christian.
<br /><br />I have never seen any Christian that still, after being saved, that has not been tempted of their own lust.
<br /><br />For there is none perfect, no not one, there is none righteous but the Father. We all have problems in this life.
<br /><br />We all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God.
<br /><br />We all must continually look unto ourselves to find, and repair, any lingering failures, and sins, we have according to the scripture;
<br /><br />“ Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.”
<br /><br />“Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.”
<br /><br />Read and understand.
<br /><br />“And thou, son of man(being born of woman.), be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.”

<br />(“Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate.”)
<br /><br />As the heathen rage over the land and people, of Israel, we look at the prophecy's of the Lord concerning the end days and Israel.
<br /><br />We have seen great persecution of Israel sense 1945, and it continues today. Many say that the land that Israel sits upon belongs to others, the Palestinians, and the Islamic Nations that surround her, but this is all misguided belief. 
<br />The Lord promised this land to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, for an everlasting possession.   
<br /><br />“And I will give unto thee,(Abraham.) and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.” (Gen 17:8 &amp; 48:4.)
<br />Should men try to tell God that His promises are wrong, that the word of the Lord means nothing? Who shall be able to stand against the Lord in the time of the end? 
<br /><br />Woe be it to those that fight against Israel, woe be it to those that fight against the Lord, for they shall fall by the sword, for they have lived by the sword.
<br />Their tongs shall consume away in their mouths, their skin shall consume away as they stand, they shall be cut off from the land never to be remembered again until the final judgment.  (A great consuming fire shall come to pass.) 
<br /><br />None that will fight against Israel shall be able to stand. These thing shall be done unto them as a recompense of the evil they have done against the Lord. For as one fights against the Lord they fight against His Christ, for the Lord and His Son Jesus are one, think as one, act as one and, defend as one. 
<br /><br />“Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate(Jerusalem.) of my people(Israel.) in the day of their calamity(hardship.); yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction(state of pain, distress, or grief.) in the day of their calamity,(Men shall see this as an opportunity to attack and make a plunder of the people of Israel.) nor have laid hands(Took hold of .) on their substance(possessions.) in the day of their calamity;(great misfortune, or cause of misery; generally applied to events or disasters which produce extensive evils, as loss of crops, earthquakes, conflagrations, defeat of armies, and the like. ) 
<br /><br />“Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway,(path.) to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up(turned over captives.) those of his that did remain in the day of distress. 
<br />For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen(non Jewish.): as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.” 
<br /><br />Disaster will fall upon all that betray, fight against, and, or, captivate any of the children of Israel. They will fight and kill these children thinking that they are doing Gods service, but they shall fall as the wheat and blown down as if a whirlwind has struck them. They shall see the Lord, not as they believe, but as a avenger against them and all that have fought against His people and His Christ. 
<br /><br />Will Israel fall to the heathen, will the gates be violated by evil, and filth, will the temple be desecrated by their god? 
<br />Yes, for as it is written, a statue of the anti-Christ shall stand within the Holy Place, and shall spout great abominations against the living God. 
<br />A time of great destruction, pain and sorrow shall befall the children of the most high, but are remembered by the Lord, saved and delivered by Him. 
<br /><br />The plague.
<br /><br />“And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.”
<br /><br />“consume away”;  To destroy, by separating the parts of a thing, by decomposition, as by fire, or eating, devouring, and annihilating the form of a substance. 
<br /><br />A great fire, as if it were a nuclear blast, shall come upon all the nations army's, as they prepare to attack the Children of Israel. We see this not only in the Book of Revelations but also in the Old Testament prophecy's. 
<br /><br />“For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
<br />For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.” 
<br /><br />References;
<br /> Rev_18:6-8, Isa_34:1-17, Isa_66:15-16; Eze_38:18-22; Eze_39:4-6, Eze_39:17-20
<br /><br />And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord (The commotion, disturbance or agitation of a multitude, usually accompanied with great noise, uproar and confusion of voices.)shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour. 
<br />And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.” 
<br /><br />This Confederacy of Evil has, and continues to, spread among the gentiles, the United Nations has time after time, condemned the Nation of Israel for defending herself. Many in the United States are also calling for a dismemberment of the land of Israel. As goes the Nation of Israel so goes the world. Many say, and I also believe, that Israel is the central point on this earth, and is the center of this universe that the Lord has made. All things started, and all shall be, finished there. Christianity is not, nor ever will be a partaker of this evil confederacy.

<br /><br />The Great Commission is; To Charge; order; mandate; given authority.
<br /><br />We have been given a great commission to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, threw-out the world, no matter what the cost.
<br /><br />We are hated by the world by reason of this commission, and will be, until the end. There is an end and the end is here among us.
<br /><br />We have heard this mandate from the Lord and will suspend all of our acts and carry out what we are sent to do.
<br /><br />It is said by many, that the two most hated words in any language is, Jesus Christ, and it is so. We preach repentance of sins and salvation threw only that name. There is no other God, no god was ever formed before the Lord nor any after. We have seen the power of God, we have seen His majesty and His glory.
<br /><br />“When this Gospel is preached in all nations, then the end shall come.”
<br /><br />And saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”
<br /><br />“Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
<br /><br />Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
<br /><br />Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
<br /><br />I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.”
<br /><br />“Bring forth the blind people that have eyes.”
<br /><br />Bring forth the blind in spirit, that the Lord may save them.
<br /><br />Bring them forth that their eyes may be opened to the truth, let them see the Glory of God and His Christ, that they may know that the Lord is God and there is no other way to salvation.
<br /><br />There is none so blind than those, that will not see.
<br /><br />With the physical, all men see, but threw the eyes of the spiritual, multitudes have been blinded by lust, greed, and the pride, that fills the soul and causes many to perish with the using.
<br /><br />The blinded, that cause others to worship false gods, lead not only themselves to death and destruction, but also lead those that follow them. The road to Hell is paved with good intentions, false gods, and doctrines that are contrary to sound judgment.
<br /><br />“Bring forth the deaf that have ears.”
<br /><br />Let the deaf that have ears, hear the everlasting Gospel.
<br /><br />Let them hear of a man from Galley, that came from God, and was the Son of God, that they may hear His wonderful message of life and salvation. We have the liberty to preach His Gospel, the commission to extend a hand of welcome to all that will hear of a man from Galley, who gave His life on Calvary, rose from the dead, and conquered death and Hell for all that would believe upon Him. For by no other name, no other God, no other gospel shall a man be saved.
<br /><br />As it was in the day of Noah, we see and hear those same thoughts, those same excuses, and the lies of adultery, going after strange gods and stranger doctrines.
<br /><br />“For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
<br /><br />But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.”
<br /><br />“Should be converted.”
<br /><br />Converted: To bring to a likeness; to cause to resemble.
<br /><br />Changed from a state of sin to a state of holiness; applied to a particular use; appropriated.
<br /><br />A person who is converted from one opinion or practice to another; a person who renounces one creed, religious system, and embraces another; applied particularly to those who change their religious opinions, to go from darkness to light.
<br /><br />To convert those that are lost, has at times, and especially in today's world, has come with much danger.
<br /><br />Other religions will cause any conversion to bring forth the death penalty. Not understanding the free will that all men have to choose.
<br /><br />Not understanding the will of man to seek out the truth, not only of where he came from but most importantly, where he is going.
<br /><br />This life is short and requires many decisions.
<br /><br />The man who hears the Gospel and believes will be changed forever.
<br /><br />He has the promise of the Lord Jesus, to have a life everlasting waiting for him, when we pass from death to life.
<br /><br />Is hearing the gospel so dangerous, that a country, or another religion should abolish it?
<br /><br />Is Jesus Christ so dangerous to forbid His words from being heard?
<br /><br />Or is His name so powerful that they fear conversion of the lost?
<br /><br />The answer is that they, as it was with the Sadducee's and Pharisees, fear loosing control over the populace.
<br /><br />They fear losing power over those that they control with fear and intimidation.
<br /><br />What about the religions that only preach peace, love, and understanding of all religions, but refuse to preach that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?
<br /><br />Are these also a threat to the lost?
<br /><br />Are these also a threat to themselves? Can they know, or be known of, God?
<br /><br />I will answer this with the words of Christ;
<br /><br />“I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”
<br /><br />“All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.”
<br /><br />Gods word to the faithful.
<br /><br />“Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
<br /><br />say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
<br /><br />Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
<br /><br />And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
<br /><br />No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
<br /><br />And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”

<br /><br />I will not change my faith in God.
<br /><br />I will not change my faith in Jesus Christ being, the Son of God.
<br /><br />I will not change my faith in Gods word.
<br /><br />I will not change my faith in The Holy Spirit being able to teach me the ways of righteousness.
<br /><br />I will not Change my support of the children of Israel.
<br /><br />Change;
<br /><br />To quit one thing or state for another; followed by for; as, persons educated in a particular religion do not readily change it for
<br />another.
<br /><br />“I am Jehovah; I change not.” Mal 3.
<br /><br />In today;s world many people have asked for change, sometimes it is for the better and sometimes for the worst.
<br /><br />Men must accept the change that they themselves have asked for, being partaker of this change.
<br /><br />The speeches of man fall short of the will of God, for as it is written;
<br /><br />“There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.”
<br /><br />Change is not of God, for He will not, and cannot change, but change is
<br />common to man. They are blown about with every wind and doctrine.
<br /><br />When a man is not heard there is no sound nor language.
<br /><br />There is no righteousness nor unrighteousness, but as Jesus revieled the
<br />sin of the nations, mankind now is condemned of himself.
<br /><br />This is the change that Jesus brought to this earth, total accountability
<br />to all men for their actions and sins.
<br /><br />“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the
<br />Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
<br /><br />The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment
<br />of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
<br /><br />The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the
<br />Lord are true and righteous altogether.
<br /><br />More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter
<br />also than honey and the honey comb.”
<br /><br />The Lord will not change for man, He will not change for His Kingdom, nor
<br />will He change for His Son.
<br /><br />For the laws of the Lord are perfect in every way, His judgments upon all
<br />sin is true and just. His word of life is enduring and His word of
<br />death is lasting. Death will come to all, but the second death will
<br />come to those that will not change.
<br /><br />Our behaviour toward God and His word, tell us how we shall live after
<br />death of the body, for the soul of man never dies.
<br /><br />We will not change our belief that there are all manner of false
<br />religions in the world, we will not change our belief that without
<br />Jesus there is no salvation to any man.
<br /><br />There is no change in God, for He is the creator of all things visible, and
<br />invisible.
<br /><br />Those that believe in another God, another way to Heaven, or another way of
<br />creation must change, or die in their sins.
<br /><br />The Lords word tells all that without the shedding of blood there is no
<br />remission of sin, for Jesus died once for all mankind, and will not
<br />return to this world as a babe in swaddling clothing but as a King
<br />with a rod of Iron to rule the world.
<br /><br />Though we suffer persecution, we will not change, though we suffer hatred,
<br />we will not change. We are Christians and will suffer for our
<br />testimony of Christ. Finances will rise and fall and we will not
<br />change, our health will improve and fail us but we will not change.
<br /><br />Our lives as believers will be full of persecution, men will hate us for
<br />our resistance to change.
<br /><br />We can not, nor will we, change Gods word. Many will hate you for this,
<br />but it is better to suffer as a Christian than to suffer as an
<br />unbeliever.
<br /><br />The natural disasters affect all, the floods, fires, disease, the famine,
<br />the drought, all will be partaker in it, but the believers still will
<br />not change, for we know that our Redeemer lives.
<br /><br />We rejoice in persecutions, in perils, in disasters, in war, famine, we
<br />rejoice in ourselves knowing that when the Lords will, for us, is
<br />accomplished, we are better off than we were before.
<br /><br />We are made strong by our weakness, we are made stronger in our faith,
<br />we are made stronger by our patience, waiting upon the Lord for His
<br />deliverance.
<br /><br />By faith we persevere, by faith we endure, by understanding we accept
<br />our state in life and by our perseverance we live.
<br /><br />Who then is a good servant that will endure these things?
<br /><br />A servant that knows that the Lord does not change.
<br /><br />“I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:” “Brethren, I
<br />count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do,
<br />forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto
<br />those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize
<br />of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”
<br /><br />We run, for we know where we are headed.
<br /><br />We run this race for we know certainly that God is with us.
<br /><br />We speak because we know, we testify because we have seen and have understood, we do not beat the air as one who wants to win without
<br />labour.
<br /><br />“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
<br />more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
<br /><br />While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
<br />not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things
<br />which are not seen are eternal.”
<br /><br />The things that are behind us will not change, for they are written down
<br />in history, but the Lord is gracious in remembering our great fight
<br />of afflictions. He remembers when we are in trouble, in pain, in
<br />sorrow.
<br /><br />There is a book of remembrance within the reach of God.
<br /><br />This book shall be opened, and all men shall give account of their
<br />resistance to Him and His Son, and a remembrance to those who have
<br />resisted change for the glory of God.
<br /><br />I will not change saith the Lord, I am and shall always be, I am from
<br />everlasting to everlasting, the same yesterday, today and forever.

It is a constituent part of fortitude which implies patience to bear continued suffering.
<br /><br />“Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.”
<br />In these troublesome times we are expected by the Lord to have courage and patience. Courage to face the trials, troubles, persecution and hatred that our belief in Jesus brings upon us. We are to have courage in the face of adversity and persecution, in the face of petulance, famine and even in times of war. We see many today that lack the courage to still believe when everything is going wrong. 
<br /><br />We are to have courage in the persecution and hatred, whether it is in the form of the infliction of pain, punishment or death unjustly by others, particularly for adhering to our religious creed or mode of worship, either by way of penalty or for their compelling us to renounce our principles. For as it is written for our understanding; Many are the afflictions of the righteous.
<br /><br />The Apostle Paul stated of His faith in Christ; I am set for the defence of the gospel. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, the just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
<br /><br />The righteousness of God is revealed in each person’s faith in Him and upon His being able to provide sustenance, protection and salvation to each. There is no courage in turning away from Christ, no courage in saving one’s life, no courage in denouncing the word of God and knowing it is the only way to be saved. Many have gone in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, a man who lacked courage to accept the way of the Lord and righteousness.
<br /><br />Because that which may be known of God is manifest in us by our courage and persistence in acceptance of His word as being true. He sustains us in His promises, no matter what we face, no matter where we are and no matter whom we are. Earthquakes, fires, floods, petulance, wars, rumors of wars and persecution is a way of life that effects all mankind, but the difference is that only those that follow the Lord are not afraid of these things.
<br /><br />“Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.” We see persecution in many forms. Lawlessness, the burning of our churches, the murder of our brothers and sisters in Christ, laws that are being passed trying to limit our ability to speak the truth, and so called peaceful religions that call upon our destruction because we will not bow down to their false gods and doctrines. Many today that say they believe in Christ are changing laws and doctrines to accept unrighteousness as a way of increasing their numbers, not once considering the souls of those that are still lost.
<br /><br />“Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” Courage is being able to speak against all manner of unrighteousness no matter what the world thinks or believes. Being politically correct in today’s world means to accept all unrighteousness, religions and keeping silent about salvation threw Jesus Christ. Seeking the acceptance of the world is easy, being of great courage is another.
<br /><br />We who believe in Christ must develop patience to bear continued suffering. There are courts around the world that have declared that it is better for orphans to live with non-believers, gays and lesbians than to live in a Christian home. Jesus stated of these times we live in; “ For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
<br /><br />All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
<br /><br />And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

<br /><br />The Apostle Paul stated of His faith in Christ; I am set for the defence of the gospel. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, the just shall live by faith. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.
<br /><br />The righteousness of God is revealed in each person’s faith in Him and upon His being able to provide sustenance, protection and salvation to each. There is no courage in turning away from Christ, no courage in saving one’s life, no courage in denouncing the word of God and knowing it is the only way to be saved. Many have gone in the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, a man who lacked courage to accept the way of the Lord and righteousness.
<br /><br />Because that which may be known of God is manifest in us by our courage and persistence in acceptance of His word as being true. He sustains us in His promises, no matter what we face, no matter where we are and no matter whom we are. Earthquakes, fires, floods, petulance, wars, rumors of wars and persecution is a way of life that effects all mankind, but the difference is that only those that follow the Lord are not afraid of these things.
<br /><br />“Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.” We see persecution in many forms. Lawlessness, the burning of our churches, the murder of our brothers and sisters in Christ, laws that are being passed trying to limit our ability to speak the truth, and so called peaceful religions that call upon our destruction because we will not bow down to their false gods and doctrines. Many today that say they believe in Christ are changing laws and doctrines to accept unrighteousness as a way of increasing their numbers, not once considering the souls of those that are still lost.
<br /><br />“Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” Courage is being able to speak against all manner of unrighteousness no matter what the world thinks or believes. Being politically correct in today’s world means to accept all unrighteousness, religions and keeping silent about salvation threw Jesus Christ. Seeking the acceptance of the world is easy, being of great courage is another.
<br /><br />We who believe in Christ must develop patience to bear continued suffering. There are courts around the world that have declared that it is better for orphans to live with non-believers, gays and lesbians than to live in a Christian home. Jesus stated of these times we live in; “ For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
<br /><br />All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
<br /><br />And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

Though he be the Son of God, as to his human nature, and equal in his Divine nature with God; yet, having partaken of human nature, and having submitted to all its trials and distresses, and being in all points tempted like as we are, without feeling or consenting to sin; he is able to succor them that are tempted.” Clark.
<br /><br />“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”
<br /><br />Every creature that is or ever was upon the face of the earth is known of God. Every man, woman and child that has ever lived was told of His saving grace and mercy. Every person was, and still is, given the chance to become a child of God. Salvation threw His son Jesus was even given to those that had passed before the arrival of Jesus upon the earth. As the Jews before Christ had a high priest to offer sacrifices to the Lord for the sins of the people, Jesus became the High priest, greater than any before, that offers up supplications, petitions, and earnest request, for our daily needs, our transgressions and our mistakes that we, as humans are prone to each and every day.
<br /><br />Jesus the Son of God, declared by God, understood by the angels and recognized as such by those that believe. Who knowing our afflictions, our trials, troubles, persecution and pain, makes intersessions for us to the Father for our benefit. We no longer seek out men to confess our sins, for we all now have a higher authority to go before that can not only hear our repentance but can also forgive, blotting out our frailties and sin. Being equal with God, Jesus became God incarnate, appearing before all mankind, not as the Lord but as a servant to all, knowing that mankind was in need of salvation, to the Jew first and then to the gentile of which we all are.
<br /><br />Do we then believe that the Father made man flawed, for we suffer sickness, disease, famine, war and conflicts? Are the things that have passed, the things that are, and the things to come, that have plagued mankind are the works of a loving God? By no means, for it is the Fathers will that no man should perish but all should come into repentance. The troubles that man has faced and will continue to face, the hunger, disease, famine, wars and conflicts are the actions of man himself. The Lord concerning man. “For the Lord will not cast off for ever: But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
<br /><br />For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? (No man can declare a thing to become into existence without the command from God. Man cannot create a blade of grass, a cloud; an animal for it is not within the power of any man.)Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.” “For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.”
<br /><br />Mankind has chosen to accept the afflictions and troubles that they face because of their rejection of righteousness. They seek out only the pleasures of the flesh and the pride of life. Men complain and say that God allows suffering but they do not look within themselves to ask if it is their fault that these things occur; it is easier for them to blame the blameless, especially God. They look toward Jesus as the cause for the conflicts in the world; they look and blame Israel for the lack of peace in the middle east, not knowing God or His plan for Israel and man.
<br /><br />“Jesus being equal in his Divine nature with God; yet, having partaken of human nature, and having submitted to all its trials and distresses.” Jesus being equal in his Divine nature means Godlike; heavenly; excellent in the highest degree; extraordinary; apparently above what is human. Even though Jesus was equal with God in nature He took upon himself the appearance and frailties that mankind had, all to be able to understand what is was to be human. But unlike men He had no sin and neither committed any, for it was against His divine nature. He understood all that mankind faced the diseases, the illnesses, the pain, suffering and even humiliation.
<br /><br />All these things He took with Him to the cross, forever changing mankind’s fate, giving all men the opportunity to achieve this divine nature that He had, offering it freely to all that would believe upon Him. “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” Appropriately, the free unmerited love and favor of God, the spring and source of all the benefits men receive from him. The Lord gives us grace because of our belief in His Son. We are never burdened with more than we are able to bear.
<br /><br />Our source and supply of mercy and favor of God for everything that we have, are, and will bear, comes from the sacrifice of Jesus. Our belief in Him grants us everlasting access to the spring and source of all the benefits men receive from him. Our belief in Him grants us everlasting access to the throne of grace and the mercies of God, for He is our Father and we are His children.

<br /><br />Many today are rejoicing over what they consider a democratic move of the people in the middle east, they believe that a democratic government in the muslin nations shall bring about peace in this troubled region. This belief is misguided for even if the people are given the ability to choose their own leaders they are still being led by the spirit of anti-Christ and the hatred of Christian and Jew will continue.
<br /><br />So then what is actually happening in this region?
<br /><br />“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.”
<br /><br />“Distress of nations, with perplexity.”
<br /><br />To afflict greatly; to harass; to oppress with calamity; to make miserable. Confusion, difficulty or anxiety.
<br /><br />What is happening in this region is a precursor to the rise of the anti-Christ and his war against the Jew and Christian. The anti-Christ shall bring war to the middle east, taking three nations by force and seven but capitulation for a time. This is all spoken of in prophecy and will come about. We must remember that there must be perplexity of nations so the anti-Christ will have a reason to bring about his war of conquest thus justifying his actions.
<br /><br />Many leaders today are in a state of confusion over what reaction should be given to these events. Many state that they are Bible believing Christians but do not consult the Lord or His word for any answers. The Bible clearly states the events that will take place in the end days, giving instructions on what we are to look for and what we should be doing.  In the last two thousand years many great calamities have struck the nations of the world and they have started to escalate in these end days.
<br /><br />There are still the scoffers that even in the days of Jesus, refuse to believe in an almighty Lord, that has control of the seas, the earth and the sky above them. Many are still scoffing at the revelations that have been fulfilled, as being nonsense.
<br /><br />This is one revelation that has been fulfilled and they still ignore this fact, let’s read and understand.                                                             “And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.”
<br /><br />The Palestinians want all Jews to be removed from Judaea as part of a peace plan, this will not happen for it is stated that the Jews will still be in Judaea. The Muslim nations, even with a democratic agenda will still be just a show of democratic principles, for they will continue to call upon the destruction of Israel and Christianity around the world. We have seen this in the demonstrations, when protesters shouted out kill the Jew, or in the United Nations where Arab nations call upon their people to demonstrate against the United States because of Americas stand for the right of Israel to exist, is this the democratic way?
<br /><br />In this country I am allowed to speak freely about Jesus being the Son of God, but in the new democratic nations being formed in the Middle East, these words that I write and speak would still mean persecution, and even a death sentence. For democracy means that all men are given the right to express their views openly without any retribution.
<br /><br />The Lord speaks of His followers and tells us to be brave and bold in our testimony of the truth, without fear of the hatred that we shall encounter.
<br /><br />“But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.”
<br /><br />Even the Apostil Paul asked for prayer for the boldness to speak the Gospel without fear of the retribution that he knew would come against him.  “And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.”
<br /><br />Our boldness to speak the truth comes from fasting and prayer. It comes from our ability to look beyond the needs of the flesh and be more concerned over the needs of the spirit. Our ability to serve God is based upon our ability to believe God. Do we believe that Jesus rose from the dead? Then fear not what a man can do to the body for we are promised that we shall also be raised. Do we believe that the Lord can heal this body as many before us have been healed, then do not fear for we will face many things that are common to man. Do we believe that Israel shall be saved in one day, then fear not the rhetoric that comes from the unbelievers.
<br /><br />We must remember that our ability to speak freely of the saving grace of God threw His Son Jesus comes not from a democratic nation, law or mandate but it comes from the commission from God. We must also remember even though a nation or a people have declared that they are now democratically controlled doesn’t mean that the people are free to speak the truth.

		<document id="1e998e2095a34eed60b068e7814caf46" url=""><![CDATA[Sickness and Salvation.<br/><br/>Salvation comes to many with compassionate words of love and the sincerity of words but with others it may take fear, fear of Hell fire and eternal separation from God. We see in scripture that we are to use both to convert the lost, not hating them but loving them enough to use whatever means necessary to show them that without Jesus there is no salvation from the world to come. “And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.”
<br /><br />We also see that we as believers in Christ must become all things to all men that by some means we might save some, simply meaning that not all men shall be saved, for many shall harden their hearts to the truth and will choose the darkness of Satan over the light of Christ and God. We must remember that we are not fighting against the flesh of men but against the spirits that have corrupted men, the spirits of unrighteousness and the spirit of anti-Christ. It’s these evil spirits that control men, their words and actions. That is why when a child of God mentions salvation through Christ many will attack them and try to degrade the message of truth, it’s not the man but the spirit that controls them.
<br /><br />Sickness comes to all men; for we are all still in this body of flesh but sometimes sickness comes to some for their enlightenment into God’s grace and mercy. God will allow sickness at times to convert or save the lost, we see this also in scripture. “To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” This destruction of the flesh can take many paths, sickness, imprisonment and even mutilation of the body.
<br /><br />Considering our eternal future it is better to destroy this flesh that the soul might be saved. Simply meaning, that this body began dying the moment we were conceived but our soul (spirit which was given to us by God) will never die. For our lives on this earth are set at approximately 70 years, some more and some less, this is also proven in scripture. “The days of our years are threescore years and ten (70 years.); and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years (80 years.), yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.” Meaning that even if we live 80 years or so, all of our labour and sorrow will still be met by our death, this is one fact that is inescapable.
<br /><br />Knowing that we all, saved or lost, will die should give us our motivation to live as Christ desired us to live. Every man shall know of God and His Christ, for there will be no excuse when judgment comes to all men, every man would have had an opportunity to accept or reject Christ as their Saviour.
<br /><br />Sickness brings about the weakness of the body, which brings about the dependence upon others to care for the individual. This also happens when we age, for even if sickness doesn’t strike us, we will all soon be dependent upon others as we will all age.
<br /><br />God will allow sickness to introduce His Son to many that beforehand would not listen, to open eyes and ears that were once closed and blind to the truth, for we must remember God is a loving God and His will is that no man should perish.
<br /><br />“To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.” Sickness comes to the children of God along with the lost, in God’s children it causes the faith to increase, and it manifests God’s grace and mercy. The blindness of man brings about sickness that could otherwise be avoided. Many times sickness will come through unrighteous lifestyles, lifestyles that God declares to be an abomination.
<br /><br />For a man’s eyes to be open to the truth, a man must be willing to see and accept the truth. Satan has no power over man unless a man allows him to have it. Satan was defeated by Christ and the only power Satan has is deception and lies.
<br /><br />When we become sick we must still praise the Lord for we, as believers have Him to turn to and the Holy Spirit to aid us in all of our infirmities, this is the promise of Jesus.

<br />best/worst effort of the three primary areas of humanity and will
<br />initiate the “worst times the earth has ever seen or will ever see
<br />again”=Total Deception.” Unquote.
<br /><br />This was a nice effort on your part to try to Identify the meaning of 666, but this is not what the Bible states is the meaning or purpose. Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
<br /><br />This is indicating that the number is not a conglomeration of mankind’s faults or attributes, but of a charismatic man, of uncommon speaking ability, that will turn the world to him, one way or another. Here we see A religion or copy of a religion, brokered by the Beast (Anti-Christ.) that will seduce many, this will be his trade mark. To be anti-Christ is to denigh the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for all three are one. Mankind’s faults or attributes, are all based on one thing and one thing only, Sin. So the, so called, three primary areas of humanity have no connection to the identity of the Anti-Christ but will only add to his power.
<br /><br />The number 666 is an attribute of the Anti-Christ. This is his way of controlling all religions, until he can eliminate all but his. His religion may be a form of Christianity and Judaism combined together to deceive the very elect of God.
<br /><br />Could Mohammedanism or another form of Judaism be the religion that takes over the world, or could a man of peace call for a combination of the three major religions to bring about peace. We see that Mohammedanism (aka; Islam.)is the major religion in the middle east, this being a major player in the instability of the region.
<br /><br />The number, 666, could be a numerical value of an Islamic Individual with Jewish ties of the past, making Him acceptable to both the Islamic world and the Jews. This man must be able to broker a pact between the Jews and the Islamic factions.
<br /><br />Islam will never give up Jerusalem nor the Dome of the Rock, where the Third Temple must be built, The site of the Temple of Solomon.
<br /><br />The Anti-Christ and His number,666, must be an individual and not just human attributes, for Israel is looking for a Messiah, this must be fulfilled according to prophecy. There fore the Anti-Christ being a man will give good reason to the Muslims, why Israel should be given this area to rebuild their temple.
<br /><br />Is there proof of this in Scripture? Yes, We see this in the statement of Luke 18:7; And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? For the Apostle Paul stated that we are Jews inwardly, so we become the elect of God by adoption thru Christ and into the House of Israel thru belief, Gods Chosen.
<br /><br />Continuing with Mark 13:19-20;
<br /><br />For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
<br />And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
<br /><br />ELECT’, n. One chosen or set apart; applied to Christ.
<br />Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth. Isa 42.
<br /><br />1. Chosen or designated by God to salvation; predestinated to
<br />glory as the end, and to sanctification as the means; usually with a
<br />plural signification, the elect.
<br /><br />Shall not God avenge his own elect? Luke 18.
<br /><br />If it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Mat 24.
<br /><br />He shall send his angels–and they shall gather his elect from the four winds. Mat 24.
<br /><br />2.Chosen; selected; set apart as a peculiar church and people; applied to the Israelites. Isa 45. Dan 8:12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
<br /><br />Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the
<br />transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
<br /><br />Mat 24:15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Lengerke; According to this, the meaning is, that the “host,” or the Jewish people, were given to him at the same time, or in connection with the daily sacrifice. The conquest over the people, and the command respecting the daily sacrifice, were simultaneous. Both passed into his hands, and he exercised jurisdiction over them both.
<br /><br />Where Jesus is righteousness, Love and Compassion, the Anti-Christ will be Hate, Control and destruction, especially of his enemies and Jews.
<br /><br />Rev 17:10-11; And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
<br />And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. Perdition here meaning the like character and destiny of the individual and his religion.
<br /><br />The number, 666, is a sign or banner of Control and conquest, signifying the power of the anti-Christ. This number will be forced on many, it will not be a computer chip or anything else that is not visible. The mark will be such as can be seen by the eye and be recognized as a property mark showing ownership of that person by the anti-Christ.
<br /><br />Barnes states of the number; The plain meaning is, that the number 666 would be so connected with his name, or with what would properly designate him, that it could be determined who was meant by finding that number in his name or in his proper designation.
<br /><br />Rev 13:16-17; And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
<br /><br />And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

<br /><br />Vanity; Inflation of mind upon slight grounds; empty pride, inspired by an overweening conceit of one’s personal attainments or decorations.
<br /><br />In today’s world we see many a man deceived by what is called vanity. Vanity turns a man into what the Bible refers to as a fool. Vanity is a condition upon which a man believes himself to be more than what he actually is, just a man, vanity is also a spirit of self-worth and brings upon itself conceit. For as it is written, who is man that the Lord should take account of?
<br /><br />Vanity comes in many forms, but the most prominent is pride, pride in a big house, mode of transportation, appearance, worth and status in the community. For the vain man the idea behind all of this is, “Look at me, look how wealthy I am, how beautiful, how important, how powerful, doesn’t all of this remind you of what Nebuchadnezzar stated about Himself in, Isaiah 14:13-14,
<br /><br />“For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven(my importance will get me into Heaven.), I will exalt my throne above the stars of God(I will be more important that Gods chosen people Israel.): I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation(I will have my special place at the assemblies of worship.), in the sides of the north(Meaning, Jerusalem of which the temple was of the north side, (Psa. 48:2).): I will ascend above the heights of the clouds(The highest of places.); I will be like the most High.(Be as God.)”
<br /><br />Possessing these things is not a sin nor is it a sin to be wealthy, where the sin comes in, is when pride and vanity take hold, when the things of this life take control of the man causing him to belittle others for not having what he has, where he see the possessions of others and desires in his heart to build bigger, better, more lavish or to become more important. For the Lord makes both the wealthy and the poor, He makes the dumb, the deaf, the seeing and the blind, for the Lord is the power behind all powers that be or will be.
<br /><br />Fool; in scripture, fool is often used for a wicked or depraved person; one who acts contrary to sound wisdom in his moral deportment.(behavior; demeanor ; conduct)
<br /><br />The sin of vanity leads a person to act contrary to sound judgment, this is because Satan takes control of the vain person causing him to act and behave as they were the most important person alive. One who acts contrary to sound wisdom(knowledge founded in truth; firm; strong; valid) in his moral behavior or conduct is liken to a man who knows that his lifestyle will bring upon him his death but continues to act upon his lust of the flesh, or liken unto a man who has money to buy food and gambles it all in hopes of winning more money, which falls under the category of greed, or liken unto a man that knows that he can be saved from everlasting torment but turns the other way ignoring his best interest, saying to himself that this is all just a lie.
<br /><br />Sound wisdom is coming to grips with the true understanding of life, who created it, and what we are to do with it. Sound wisdom begins with our acknowledgment that God is and is the rewarder of those that diligently seek Him, that Jesus is the Son of God and only through Him can a man be saved, sound knowledge is understanding, and truly believing, that we were created for Gods good pleasure and not the other way around.
<br /><br />We see sound wisdom in these next verses. “Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.” Weather a man be a fool, or wise, rich or poor, both hungers, thirst, both know pain and pleasure, heat and cold, both become ill, grow old and die. Why then is one man wiser than the other or one rich and another poor, and does this become so important that this will cause a man to become vain in his actions? Does vanity lengthen a man’s life, make him healthier, and make him more likely to be accepted by God?
<br /><br />“For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? As the fool.” A wise man at the time of his death is remembered for only a short time, his accomplishments, his life; his very presence is soon forgotten with the passing of time. How many remember their grandfathers, grandfather, who can remember what a president stood for after a few generations have passed, who can remember a king, a prince, a ruler after fifty years have passed?
<br /><br />The remembrances of a fool and a wise man each pass with time, neither is remembered, neither is considered and neither is mourned for ever. Yes there are a few men who remain in the consciousness of man today, some for their fame, some for their shame, but by and by all will be forgotten. Men remember some because they make the departed a god unto themselves. But the Lord has no respect of persons, for each was created by Him and each will be judged according to His word. The rich the poor, the famous and the infamous will all stand before the Lord and give account of all their works under the sun.
<br /><br />Ars GBTN, TSK, KJV, Clark Ecc 2:14-16, Exo. 4:11

<br />To bear, believe, hope, and to endure is the law of Christ concerning those who follow after truth and righteousness. Christians are, in a way, an island unto themselves, not being without an opportunity for others to have accessibility to us, but we have come out from among the world and have become a separated people, being separated from this world by the spirit of God and His Christ that dwells within us. 
<br /><br />We Beareth all things.                                                                             To bear; to suffer without resentment, to have patience or to carry.          We have come to understand that we are to bear the infirmities of the weak, for not all men have the same level of faith. For as it is written, show me your works without faith and Ill shall show you my works by faith. Christians around the world today bear many afflictions, hatred, violence against themselves and their belief in Christ, persecution and discrimination. Many laws have been and will continue to be written to subvert the Gospel and those that will carry it to the lost. We suffer because the unrighteous fear the Gospel.
<br />Christians have and will continue to suffer for the sake of the Gospel and are blessed for our efforts. As the spirit of anti-Christ continues its attack on the followers of Christ, our persecution will continue to grow until the burdens of them will cause God to shorten the days so that the very elect will not be deceived.
<br /><br />The Lord will not allow burdens so great to be placed upon us so that we would fall, but with every temptation He will also make away for our escape, for our God is the God of patience, this is His promise to us and He will keep it. 
<br />With patience possess we our souls, for it is by patience we strive in the Gospel without fear and without doubt, for we know that whatever we do according to the Law of Christ we shall be, blessed, redeemed and delivered out of any bondage, strife or tribulation. For we suffer without resentment, verbal abuse, hatred, persecution and all infirmities, for we are who we are by the will of God. 
<br /><br />We believeth all things.                                                                           To believe; to have a firm persuasion of anything. To expect or hope with confidence; to trust.                                                                     Christians believe in Christ and His word, without seeing, for blessed are those that have seen and believe but more blessed are those that have not seen and still believe. As the world must see anything to believe, we who believe in Christ need no visible sign from Heaven that Christ is the Son of God, we need no visible sign that Christ walked on water, turned water into wine, healed the sick, made the blind to see, the dumb to speak, nor the deaf to hear. 
<br />We need no proof that Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, nor Himself being raised from the dead having victory over hell, death and the grave. We have been introduced to a more sure word of prophecy, knowing that whatever the Lords word states will come to pass. Even with the prophetic word of God, we know that trying to understand prophecy tells us that it is more often a combination of events that prophecy is fulfilled, but by faith and belief we know that all will be fulfilled. 
<br /><br />Hopeth all things;                                                                               Hope, Webster states hope as; A desire of some good, accompanied with at least a slight expectation of obtaining it, or a belief that it is obtainable. Confidence in a future event; the highest degree of well-founded expectation of good; as a hope founded on God's gracious promises; a scriptural sense.
<br /><br />A well founded scriptural hope is, in our religion, the source of ineffable happiness.
<br />A highest degree of well-founded expectation of good comes from again our faith and belief in God, His Son and His word. Our hope and faith come from this well founded expectation of good coming from God, in reading and studying Gods word to show ourselves approved. To have hope and faith in God we must read and understand His word. Our understanding comes from the direction of the Holy Spirit of God who leads us and guides us into all truths. 
<br /><br />This is the reason that the unrighteous and mockers cannot understand our faith and hope in things that they cannot see. They cannot understand the word of God because it is spiritually discerned and without the leadership and teaching from the Holy Spirit no man can understand it. We ask the Lord for wisdom and understanding in His word and He will in like give us our desires. 
<br />Our hope lies not with man, for who is man that The Lord should take notice of Him or who among men shall council the Lord. Our hope lies not with the things that we can see, for the things that we see are not based upon hope. 
<br />Endureth all things.
<br />Endure; to last; to continue in the same state without perishing; to remain; to abide. To bear; to sustain; to support without breaking or yielding to force or pressure.
<br /><br />The word of God tells us that our worst enemies shall be those of our own household, our family, mom, dad, children and this is so in these end days. There are many prophecies that describe the lengths that many of our family members will go to stop the propagation of the gospel and our faith in God. Many other prophecies tell us that mockers shall wax worse and worse in the days leading up to the second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. We are told that we will be hated, persecuted and delivered up to the courts to stop our faith in Christ. 
<br /><br />All of these things are happening today, we see many court cases being brought forth against pastors, preachers and even lay members of the church. Christianity is under attack even from our own government. While false religions are given a free ride, political correctness has taken hold of our politicians and preaching the gospel has been vilified. We must remember that those that are saved are saved indeed, And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
