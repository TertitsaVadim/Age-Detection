In fact, it was in 2010 that the Financial Times published about the brain drain that’s flocking Australia. The one thing that drew a lot of people from U.K. and other parts of the world towards a financial services job in Australia was the recovering Australian job markets. People were keen on making the most of flourishing opportunities as well as were willing to experience the Aussie lifestyle. 
<br /><br />Some two years and six months after, the scenario is a bit disturbing. Market analysers are not optimistic about the job market. The statistics reveal that there is a massive decline in the overall <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBseWRpcmVjdC5jb20uYXUvam9icy9CYW5raW5nLUZpbmFuY2lhbC1TZXJ2aWNlcy1Kb2Jz" target="_blank">financial services job</a> market. Last year itself, Australia witnessed a 37% decline in the number of job opportunities in the financial sector. Even though some recovery has been seen in the second quarter of the current year, the overall picture is not promising. 
<br /><br />One will have to be wise in picking up financial services job. In general, look for a job that is more consultative in nature. A job in financial planning or a financial adviser’s role will be an intelligent time because consultation and advice is what people are seeking at present. Also, as far as statistics are concerned, financial planning and consultancy jobs are more or less stable as compared to other jobs in the financial sector. Sydney, which also felt the brunt of financial downfall in the first quarter of the present year is recovering its status as the hub of financial jobs in Australia.

However, people from all around the world look forward to working in Queensland. The reason why Queensland is a place much admired and looked up to by global masses is that the place has been able to turn despair into fortune; and, has been able to stand a crisis that shattered almost the entire world. 
<br /><br />Another reason why the economy of the region is doing tremendously well is that jobs in Queensland promise not only an easy livelihood but also excellent working conditions. Jobs in Queensland are responsible for making the domestic scenario better and also need to absorb the large amount of work force that pours in from various parts of the world. Statistics point out that on an average the number of people migrating to Queensland is close to 1000. The top reasons for such a large number of people coming to stay here are lifestyle, working conditions, cultures and abundant availability of jobs in Queensland.  
<br /><br />To cite and example, mining <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBseWRpcmVjdC5jb20uYXUvam9icy9qb2JzLWluLVF1ZWVuc2xhbmQ_" target="_blank">jobs in Queensland</a> offer workers a Fly-in and Fly-out (FIFO) option. Basically, FIFO means that the workers, for safety reason, will be picked and taken back from the mines. Another thing that will give a fair enough of the working conditions and jobs in Queensland’s mining industry is the fact that the miners in the region are offered a roster. Some employers offer a one week off for every three weeks of work. 
<br /><br />However, there are certain concerns with the working conditions and employment regulations in Queensland. The industrial relations environment in Queensland, Australia is a lot dependant on the business response and continuous government pressure. Employers, due to various reasons, are still sceptic and pessimistic about the economy.
