Some people can look nice in an outfit from a thrift shop even if the brands are not well known. At a fancy business party, however, those name brands just might pay off to the educated pairs of eyes in the room!<br /><br />I recently came across what I thought was the best description I'd ever seen of a &quot;premium domain name.&quot; To give the description a bit of weight, I want you to know that I didn't dream it up whole-cloth by my own little self. It actually delineates the criteria for what one of the biggest domain auction houses requires in order for a domain to be inserted into its premium domain auction. Since few members of the general domain buying public visit this house, I thought it might be a good idea to give it some press.<br /><br />First of all, a premium domain must be short and easy to remember. Actually, &quot;short and easy to remember&quot; is a prescription for a good domain of any variety of domain name, premium or otherwise. Easy to say is another requirement.<br /><br />Secondly, a premium domain is a generic domain like wood.com, clothes.com, porn.com or creditcard.com. Albertsfurniture.com is not generic. Boats.com is generic; Mikesboats is not.<br /><br />Third, the domain is easy to spell and hard to misspell. Who could misspell wood? But it's easy to do if the domain is something like architecturalengineers.com.<br /><br />Fourth, a premium domain is product-related. Furniture and clothes, for example, are megabuck products in our society. Porn, unfortunately, is another big-money item.<br /><br />Fifth, the domain does not violate any trademark rights. It's hard to imagine a generic domain that would violate any trademark rights, but right at this moment giants Apple and Amazon are fighting over the term appstore so anything is possible.<br /><br />Sixth, the domain extension geographically matches the language of the domain name. For example take the domain name Laleydice.ru. That is Spanish for &quot;the law says&quot; coupled with the top-level domain extension of the Russian Union. A ridiculous example, perhaps, but it will get the idea across. It is not a premium domain name because of a whole lot of things, but even if it were short, product related and etc., the language doesn't match the extension. Either Laleydice.es for Spain or mx for Mexico would be a better fit.<br /><br />I know I've found myself unable to describe what a premium domain was from time to time. I could point out a few examples of the more obvious ones like hardware.com and house.com but couldn't really articulate what made them different from the ordinary run of names. I for one was glad to find this list; now I can really pretend to know what I am talking about!<br /><br />Are you in search for a high quality domain that can bring you to greater heights of success without investing too much of your time, effort and even more money that you will have to usually spend on a regular domain? Do you want to ensure endless traffic for greater cash flow and ROI? We will show you where to get premium domain names that will be the foundation of your internet businesses.<br /><br />Premium domains are the higher value domains that are currently sold in marketplaces and in the various online marketing sites and forums. These domains are usually brand names. You can also find private sellers, domain investors and the online auctions.<br /><br />Buying the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getapremiumdomain.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.getapremiumdomain.com</a>  in your niche can move your business to another level.

They can trust that you know what you are doing because you at least were able to get a website that has a sensible title. You will probably see benefits from these factors especially if you maximize on the potential of having a premium name.<br /><br />If you are looking to buy domains, especially for your personal business, consider the premium domain name option. It will help you out in the long run if you use it properly. Some people can look nice in an outfit from a thrift shop even if the brands are not well known. It's likely to rank well in the search engines because of the keywords in the name. As a result, you can expect this to be a premium name. A name can also be considered as premium if it is short and easy to remember.<br /><br />Many domain brokers and traders know the value of premium names, so they do everything they can to own these names. They then sell them off in the domain name market to make a profit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, since the demand for such names are high, the competition is also fierce. Just check out a domain auction marketplace. Sometimes, you will see fierce bidding wars going on between several parties. As a domain broker or trader, a bidding war is the last thing you want to experience. So how do you profit from a domain auction?<br /><br />Tip 1: Avoid bidding wars.<br /><br />Don't get into bidding wars with your competitors. At the end of the auction, there are no winning parties. Only the domain seller wins. When a bidding war occurs, the price of the name is driven upwards. Sometimes, the price becomes so outrageous that you can't make a good profit out of the name. Therefore, never let the ego get in the way when participating in an auction. The only way to profit is to keep a cool head at all times. If the price doesn't make business sense, stop bidding!<br /><br />Tip 2: Don't bid too early.<br /><br />Don't reveal your trump cards too early in the game. You probably have a maximum bidding price at the back of your head. If you start participating in the bid too early, you attract unwanted attention from your competitors. The more bidders participating in the auction, the higher the price will be. Being aggressive in a domain auction just isn't beneficial.<br /><br />Tip 3: Grow your portfolio of clients.<br /><br />Business is about margins, and buying and selling domains isn't all that different. Grow your portfolio of clients, and if possible, try to acquire high profile clients. For instance, instead of just going after individual clients, try to go for corporate clients as well. You know that they have the money to pay for the domain names. So you can afford to bid higher for the premium names. The higher you can bid, the more names you can acquire, and the more money you make.

Heed their advice to avoid any get a premium domain surprises. The domain will be simple, easy to remember and can work wonders for your business.<br /><br />The pricing will vary depending on certain criteria that determine the value of a domain. Some of these criteria have to do with the spelling of the name, the level of ease at which people can remember it, the reputation it has had in the past and so on.<br /><br />These names are considered premium because they are better than starting a site from scratch. Who could misspell wood? But it's easy to do if the domain is something like architecturalengineers.com.<br /><br />Fourth, a premium domain is product-related. Furniture and clothes, for example, are megabuck products in our society. Porn, unfortunately, is another big-money item.<br /><br />Fifth, the domain does not violate any trademark rights. It's hard to imagine a generic domain that would violate any trademark rights, but right at this moment giants Apple and Amazon are fighting over the term appstore so anything is possible.<br /><br />Sixth, the domain extension geographically matches the language of the domain name. For example take the domain name Laleydice.ru. That is Spanish for &quot;the law says&quot; coupled with the top-level domain extension of the Russian Union. A ridiculous example, perhaps, but it will get the idea across. It is not a premium domain name because of a whole lot of things, but even if it were short, product related and etc., the language doesn't match the extension. Either Laleydice.es for Spain or mx for Mexico would be a better fit.<br /><br />I know I've found myself unable to describe what a premium domain was from time to time. I could point out a few examples of the more obvious ones like hardware.com and house.com but couldn't really articulate what made them different from the ordinary run of names. I for one was glad to find this list; now I can really pretend to know what I am talking about!<br /><br />When you learn about premium domain names and all of the great benefits they bring to your business, it may seem obvious that you would like to go that route. For some people, it is not so obvious and you may be one of those who are wondering if a premium domain name is the way to go for you. Here we will look at the benefits of having one of these names.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits For Your Customers</strong><br /><br />Depending on who exactly your customers are, they will most likely benefit from you having a premium domain name. If you intend to expand in the future and decide to get your own domain though, you will have to promote your new URL again. Before deciding between getting your own domain name and availing of an alternative domain, you need to weigh things out seriously.<br /><br />Business can be improved in many ways. Having your own domain name will definitely increase traffic. Search engines and directories prioritize sites with their own domains. With this set-up, you won't have to pay for the service but will be subjected to the limitations of the provider site though.<br /><br />It never hurts to be well-informed with the latest on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nZXRhcHJlbWl1bWRvbWFpbi5jb20_" target="_blank">get affordable domain</a>.

Another way to use domain forwarding is by using 'CNAME' or 'A' records.<br /><br />Like with many things, registering your domain name and deciding whether it is a good idea to forward it or not is mostly up to what you are planning to do. If you want to make your own web site with original content that will generate revenue, you should likely register a good domain name and pay for hosting space. But, if you just want to have your own personal blog on the internet, it would be easier to get a cheap domain and forward it to an already established blogging web site.<br /><br />It's entirely up to your discretion, but either way, I hope you've found this article about domain registration and domain forwarding helpful on your journey to create your own web site.<br /><br /><strong>Your Domain name is the first thing that will attract or repel potential customers.</strong><br /><br />Don't scare people off with a poorly conceived URL spend some time researching exactly what your intended customers are searching for &amp;amp; name your site accordingly.<br /><br /><strong>Existing Businesses</strong><br /><br />If you already have an existing business &amp;amp; an established clientele then this part of the process is simple - people looking for your business will search your business name&amp;nbsp; &amp;amp; if that doesn't work they will expand their search by adding city or state.&amp;nbsp;<br /><br />If your business name URL is available get it - If not then there are a number of techniques you can use.<br /><br />i.e. If your business name is &quot;Tony's Pizza&quot; &amp;amp; is on Summit Road&amp;nbsp; in Elgin Illinois (No such Pizzeria)<br /><br />1. Hyphens - Tonys-Pizza.com<br />&lt;br&gt;2. Emphasis - BigTonysPizza.com <br />&lt;br&gt;3. Property - TonysPizzaParlor.com<br />&lt;br&gt;4. Address - TonysElginPizza.com / TonysPizza-Summit.com / TonysIllinoisPizza.com<br /><br />As you can see there are any number of ways to change a domain name that is already taken,&amp;nbsp; make it your own &amp;amp; have your customers find you on-line.<br /><br /><strong>New On-line Businesses</strong><br /><br />Imagine you were opening a store in your local shopping mall - Although the name is important all the people visiting the Mall will walk by your store, so even if you called it &quot;Cat Food&quot; &amp;amp; sold &quot;Live Fish&quot; your potential customers would still be exposed to your store.<br /><br />Not so On-line -&amp;nbsp; If you want customers you need a &quot;Premium Domain Name&quot;<br /><br />A Premium URL is not one you need to spend $5000 on, its just one that targets motivated buyers &amp;amp; along with your Description makes them &lt;u&gt;click on your link&lt;/u&gt;.<br /><br />I am not going to delve too deeply into keyword research here but there are several key factors to consider<br /><br />&lt;em&gt;<strong>General Search Terms</strong>&lt;/em&gt; - clothes / food / toys / cars, are all very general search terms - People searching this broadly are not looking for something in particular.<br /><br />&lt;em&gt;<strong>Specific Search Terms</strong>&lt;/em&gt; - pants / lobster /dolls / mini, These are second level keywords they are still not detailed enough terms to define buyers from browsers<br /><br />&lt;em&gt;<strong>Detailed Keywords</strong>&lt;/em&gt; - Designer Pants / Fresh Lobster Delivery / American Girl Doll / Mini Cooper S - These people know what they want &amp;amp; are looking to buy.<br /><br />&lt;em&gt;<strong>Buy Keywords</strong>&lt;/em&gt; - Tommy Hilfiger Pants / Cheap Fresh Lobster Delivery / Buy American Girl Dolls / Used Red Mini Cooper<br /><br />Detailed &amp;amp; Buy Keywords should be utilized in your URL &amp;amp; sub folders&amp;nbsp; to get motivated buyers into your site.<br /><br />Spend some time researching your idea, consider the various terms that someone looking to buy your product or service may use.<br /><br />Remember a Premium Domain Name is one that attracts motivated buyers not browsers.<br /><br />Internet marketers have always known of buying and selling domains as a way of making some cash and profit. Buying and selling domains can start as a hobby and a lifetime business with endless successful results if given proper attention each day.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nZXRhcHJlbWl1bWRvbWFpbi5jb20_" target="_blank">get a premium domain</a>

Therefore, never let the ego get in the way when participating in an auction. The only way to profit is to keep a cool head at all times. If the price doesn't make business sense, stop bidding!<br /><br />Tip 2: Don't bid too early.<br /><br />Don't reveal your trump cards too early in the game. You probably have a maximum bidding price at the back of your head. If you start participating in the bid too early, you attract unwanted attention from your competitors. The more bidders participating in the auction, the higher the price will be. Being aggressive in a domain auction just isn't beneficial.<br /><br />Tip 3: Grow your portfolio of clients.<br /><br />Business is about margins, and buying and selling domains isn't all that different. Grow your portfolio of clients, and if possible, try to acquire high profile clients. For instance, instead of just going after individual clients, try to go for corporate clients as well. You know that they have the money to pay for the domain names. So you can afford to bid higher for the premium names. The higher you can bid, the more names you can acquire, and the more money you make.<br /><br />Chances are, dear reader, its just wishful thinking. Over time I've read quite a number of articles (not on ezine articles)where the author talks about this or that domain name that he owns being valuable because it meets this or that criteria for premium status. Take this with a grain of salt.<br /><br />There are no rules for premium domain names, only rule makers. Pundits on the net will tell you that a premium name should be a.com and made up of one or two short generic words. That might be true most of the time but recently &quot;Kreishandwerkershaften.de&quot; went for almost twenty thousand USD. You'll be told the name shouldn't contain any numerals. So what about &quot;434.Com,&quot; recently sold for $18,500?<br /><br />My own favorite rule is the one that claims premium names can't contain hyphens; rumor has it the engineers at Google don't like domain names with hyphens. Then what about &quot;Black-Jack.Com&quot; which recently sold for more than $ 25,000?<br /><br />In all fairness to the domain pundits-among whose number Yours Truly must be listed-the rules I've ridiculed are generally an accurate reflection of reality. In most cases a premium domain name will be short, made up of one or two generic words, won't contain either numerals or hyphens, and will have a Com extension. The important thing to realize is that nobody can guarantee you a premium name because for the most part it isn't so simple a matter as feeding data into a computer and registering the result. Even if it were, most of us couldn't afford the software for the search. So don't believe anyone that tells you they can.<br /><br />I think there is only one answer to the question posed by the title that will be true in a majority of cases: Money! Lots of Money. Buying and selling domains can start as a hobby and a lifetime business with endless successful results if given proper attention each day.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nZXRhcHJlbWl1bWRvbWFpbi5jb20_" target="_blank">get a premium domain</a>

It is unbelievable the market for selling website names is becoming bigger every day.<br /><br />There is much greater demand for dot com domains name. Perhaps this is the reason why the market is growing at a rapid rate. Good quality dot com names are hard to get. Yes, you can register a dot com name with a hyphen or by adding a letter to it but the hurting fact is that it does not qualify the qualities of a good domain name.<br /><br />To be realistic, demand for dot com names is greater than other type of extensions. Their supply is much lesser hence the demand and supply forces don't balance. The market for dot com names is in trouble. It is experiencing a disequilibrium (The demand outweighs the supply.) If the demand outweighs the supply, what do you think happens in the market?<br /><br />Since the future is uncertain, who knows that dot com names will be costing a fortune in the near future? If this is the scenario, then it means that the moment you want to buy your domain name you will find that it was long time snatched.

No, there are many choices. You can either buy an expired or premium domains name.<br /><br />These two ways play a great role in the online market for dot com domains name.

Heed their advice to avoid any get a premium domain surprises. And the topic of get a premium domain is no exception. Keep reading to get more fresh news about get a premium domain. <br /><br />You've got a business or business plan and now want to name your site. This will help to get your website found and noticed by your prospective customers.<br /><br />For example, if your website is about training dogs, dogtraining.com would be the perfect name but, unsurprisingly, some bright spark has already taken it. You could try adding a prefix or suffix e.g. bestdogtraining.com or dogtrainingcenter.com. Ideally, when buying a domain name, you want to try and find a name that is short which will stick in the minds of your visitors so that they can more easily recall it should they wish to return to your site or recommend it to their friends.<br /><br />Try to avoid very long domain names (although it's not always possible) and names that are not really a word. Pfjzht.com is certainly unique and might very well be available to register but how will anybody be able to say it and what would it tell anyone about the products or services you offer?<br /><br />The best TLD (top level domain) extension to use is.com. There are a lot of free online tools out there that can help suggest good domain name ideas. Some of these tools are run by the registrars (i.e. GoDaddy, NetWork Solutions, etc) and some of these tools are run by independent websites (i.e. MakeWords.com). But they're all free.<br /><br />Basically, you type in the domain name you want. The online tool will tell you if the domain name is available, or it will suggest a list of other domain names that you might be interested in. They come up with the list by adding words before (prefix) or after (suffix) your search term.<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;For example, Google.com is taken, but &lt;b&gt;hot&lt;/b&gt;Google&lt;b&gt;store&lt;/b&gt;.com is not. &lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />Some of the better domain name idea tools will use a thesaurus to come up with similar but different words. Although we probably wouldn't buy a domain name from Yahoo, we did like their domain name tool.<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;For example, redcafe.com is taken, but Red&lt;b&gt;Diner&lt;/b&gt;.com is not.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />MakeWords.com is a neat tool because they have an advanced keyword tool search that lets you choose different themes of words to try before or after your search term.<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;So, for example, their &quot;action&quot; theme tries different combinations of your search term and words like jump, shout, cut, etc. &lt;/li&gt;<br />  &lt;li&gt;Their colors theme adds words like red, blue, yellow... You get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />The best part of MakeWords is that you can create your own list of words to add to your search term. Just click on &quot;list of affixes&quot; at the bottom of the webpage and enter in a custom list of words that you like.

Keep reading to get more fresh news about get a premium domain. <br /><br />You've got a business or business plan and now want to name your site. You can spend from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars on a premium name and some people think that you get what you pay for.<br /><br />One benefit will be higher traffic. Not only because people can remember your name easier, but because some people might type it in because they used to go to the website in its previous state. Their friends will be able to find you without accidentally finding other sites with complicated names and then word of mouth can function in fabulous ways.<br /><br />Your site may be ranked higher on search engines partially because people will trust it and click on it more. This could help you generate money from advertising if that is what you want to do. If someone is looking for a business like yours and comes across a few sites, one being [business type].com and the other being [business type]-[another word]-[a slogan].com, they are probably going to click on the more simple address that looks more like a website and less like a page of crowded advertisements and popups.<br /><br />Everyone is different and not everyone wants to spend hundreds or thousands on something like a domain name. Other people want to buy domains that have every possible benefit in the world so that their business can flourish as much as possible. The choice is ultimately yours and you can always talk to others at domaining forums to learn about what benefits they have found from having a premium domain name or an original one. Just be sure to examine every avenue so that you can make the decisions that are truly best for you and your business!<br /><br />New businesses looking to start their online website often look for the best way to register their domain name and come up with the best address for customers to access their website. One great way to accomplish this is to use the service available from Yahoo. Using the Yahoo Domain service is simple, low cost, and backed by the Yahoo website once you make your choice.<br /><br />A domain name is an address for your website. The website address consists of a primary name and top level domain extension at the end of the address like.com,.net,.edu (for public schools), and.org. It is important to pick a good domain name that will attract business to your site and tie in with the type of service or product you are trying to sell online. Yahoo Domains can help you find the right primary name that will attract the most customers and help promote your site by hosting it on their network.<br /><br />Businesses looking to register their domain name ideas can count on Yahoo to provide quality domain service at a low cost price.

Keep reading to get more fresh news about get a premium domain. <br /><br />You've got a business or business plan and now want to name your site. If you would like to do a search for one of these just go to deleteddomains.com.<br /><br />You may also find your ideal name, or something similar, can be purchased from the registered owner or a reseller of premium domain names.<br /><br />This will cost more than registering a new domain but will pay huge dividends in the future and give a much greater return on investment than a cheaper, available domain name that doesn't accurately reflect your business.<br /><br />If you do choose a domain name that has been used before be sure to check that it hasn't been blacklisted or banned as this can cause a lot of problems when you try to get your new website indexed with the search engines. You can carry out a check at selfseo.com and use their Google ban check tool.<br /><br />With all the headlines, and news coverage, about the record sales prices being paid, for generic domain names. One might think, these traffic favorites are the most valuable of all, the classes of domain names. In actuality though, the sales prices of the most valuable top Business Addresses ever sold have been secretly withheld from the public. The fact is, many of the most valuable Business Addresses never reach public auctions.<br /><br />So why are we, the public, not privy to the highest prices being paid for these premium domain names? Actually it is because of a little known fact, that many of the largest corporate investors, prefer to make their purchases, of premium domain names, in strictly private transactions. These private transactions are used, to deliberately hide prices being paid for domain names. For this reason, many of the largest dollar values being paid for premium domain names, never hit the headlines, and are never reported!<br /><br />Why is this so? Why do these corporate buyers and speculators not want it publicized, how truly valuable, some top domain names are? In a nutshell, they know increased competition, will inflate the market prices they pay for the names they covet. They do not want to draw any more attention to Business Addresses, and their values, than necessary.<br /><br />The last thing they want to do is compete for names they truly want and then possibly lose them to higher bidders. To avoid this they choose to operate in closed non public transactions, that are far removed from the public eye. In this cloak of secrecy, these corporate buyers, do not have to competitively bid for a rapidly disappearing pool of top Business Addresses. This explains why they are clearly absent from most public auctions where sales prices are competitively bid and disclosed to the press and public.<br /><br />In this controlled market place these professional buyers look for unique names that stand out in the crowd and signify an image that differentiates their company from the rest of the pack. So, buyer beware.<br /><br />Now might be a good time to write down the main points covered above. The act of putting it down on paper will help you remember what's important about .
