<br />But where's your heart?

<br />But where's your,
<br /><br />And I know.
<br />There's nothing I can say.
<br />To change that part.
<br />To change that part.
<br />To change.
<br /><br />So many, 
<br />Bright lights they cast a shadow,
<br />But can I speak?
<br />Well is it hard understanding,
<br />I'm incomplete?
<br />A life that's so demanding,
<br />I get so weak.
<br />A love that's so demanding,
<br />I can't speak.
<br /><br />I am not afraid to keep on living,
<br />I am not afraid to walk this world alone
<br />Honey if you stay I'll be forgiven,
<br />Nothing you can say can stop me going home.
<br /><br />Can you see?
<br />My eyes are shining bright,
<br />'Cause I'm out here, on the other side,
<br />Of a jet black hotel mirror,
<br />And I'm so weak.
<br />Is it hard understanding?
<br />I'm incomplete.

<br /><br />These bright lights have always blinded me.
<br />These bright lights have always blinded me.
<br /><br />I say.
<br /><br />I see you lying next to me,
<br />With words I thought I'd never speak,
<br />Awake, and unafraid.
<br />Asleep, or dead.

<br />And if they get me take this spike to my heart and
<br />And if they get me and the sun goes down
<br />And if they get me take this spike and
<br />You put the spike in my heart
<br /><br />And if the sun comes up will it tear the skin right off our bones
<br />And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks I saw you there
<br />Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
<br />Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
<br />And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
<br />And if they come and get me
<br />What if you put the spike in my heart
<br /><br />And if they get me and the sun goes down
<br />And if they get me take this spike and
<br /><br />(Come on!)
<br /><br />Can you take this spike?
<br />Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
<br />Night time sky?
<br />Can you take this spike?
<br />Will it wash away this jet black feeling?
<br /><br />And now the nightclub sets the stage for this they come in pairs she said
<br />We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey they're always there
<br />Someone get me to the doctor, and someone call the nurse
<br />And someone buy me roses, and someone burned the church
<br />We're hanging out with corpses, and driving in this hearse
<br />And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul
<br /><br />Can you take this spike?
<br />Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless
<br />Night time sky?
<br />Can you take this spike?
<br />Will it wash away this jet black now?
<br /><br />(Let's go! Come on!)
<br /><br />And as these days watch over time, and as these days watch over time
<br />And as these days watch over us tonight
<br /><br />I'll never let them, I'll never let them
<br />I'll never let them hurt you not tonight
<br />I'll never let them, I can't forget them
<br />I'll never let them hurt you, I promise
<br /><br />Struck down, before our prime
<br />Before, you got off the floor
<br />Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
<br /><br />Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
<br />(And these thoughts of endless night
<br />bring us back into the light 
<br />and this venom from my heart)
<br /><br />Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
<br />(And these thoughts of endless night
<br />bring us back into the light 
<br />kill this venom from my heart)
<br /><br />Can you stake me before the sun goes down?
<br /><br />(And as always, innocent like roller coasters.
<br />Fatality is like ghosts in snow and you have no idea what you're up against 
<br />because I've seen what they look like. 
<br />Becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws going cascading...)

<br />When you're out on your own
<br />If I crash on the couch
<br />Can I sleep in my clothes?
<br />'Cause I've spent the night dancing
<br />I'm drunk, I suppose
<br />If it looks like I'm laughing
<br />I'm really just asking to leave
<br /><br />This alone, you're in time for the show
<br />You're the one that I need
<br />I'm the one that you loathe
<br />You can watch me corrode like a beast and repose
<br />'Cause I love all the poison
<br />Away with the boys in the band
<br /><br />I've really been on a bender and it shows
<br />So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
<br /><br />Give me a shot to remember
<br />And you can take all the pain away from me
<br />A kiss and I will surrender
<br />The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
<br />A light to burn all the empires
<br />So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
<br />In love with all of these vampires
<br />So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
<br /><br />There's a place in the dark where the animals go
<br />You can take off your skin in the cannibal glow
<br /><br />Juliet loves the beat and the lust it commands
<br />Drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands, Romeo
<br /><br />I've really been on a bender and it shows
<br />So why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?
<br /><br />Give me a shot to remember
<br />And you can take all the pain away from me
<br />A kiss and I will surrender
<br />The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead
<br />A light to burn all the empires
<br />So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
<br />In love with all of these vampires
<br />So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
<br /><br />Oh!
<br /><br />Give me a shot to remember
<br />And you can take all the pain away from me
<br />A kiss and I will surrender

<br />A light to burn all the empires
<br />So bright the sun is ashamed to rise and be
<br />In love with all of these vampires
<br />So you can leave like the sane abandoned me
<br /><br />Oooooo, Oooooo, Oooooo yeah, Oooooo

<br /><br />To un-explain the unforgivable,
<br />Drain all the blood and give the kids a show.
<br />By streetlight this dark night,
<br />A séance down below.
<br />There're things that I have done,
<br />You never should ever know!
<br /><br />And without you is how I disappear,
<br />And live my life alone forever now.
<br />And without you is how I disappear,
<br />And live my life alone forever now.
<br /><br />Who walks among the famous living dead,
<br />Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed.
<br />And if you could talk to me,
<br />Tell me if it's so,
<br />That all the good girls go to heaven.
<br />Well, heaven knows
<br /><br />That without you is how I disappear,
<br />And live my life alone forever now.
<br /><br />And without you is how I disappear,
<br />And live my life alone forever now.
<br /><br />Can you hear me cry out to you?
<br />Words I thought I'd choke on figure out.
<br />I'm really not so with you anymore.
<br />I'm just a ghost,
<br />So I can't hurt you anymore,
<br />So I can't hurt you anymore.
<br /><br />And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?
<br />Let me go, fuck!
<br />So, you can, well now so, you can
<br />I'm so far away from you.
<br />Well now so, you can.
<br /><br />And without you is how I disappear,
<br />And without you is how I disappear,
<br />Whoa whoa... (And without you is how I disappear)
<br />Whoa whoa... (And without you... is how, is how, is how...)
<br />Forever, forever now!
