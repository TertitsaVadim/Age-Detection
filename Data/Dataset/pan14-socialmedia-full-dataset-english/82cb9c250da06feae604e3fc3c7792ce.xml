<br />just the other day, 
<br />on the playground at school 
<br />between the tires and the swings 
<br /><br />But she came home with tear-filled eyes, 
<br />and she said to me &quot;Daddy, Alyssa lies&quot; 
<br /><br />Well I just brushed it off at first, 
<br />'cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt 
<br />or the things she had seen. 
<br />I wasn't ready when I said &quot;You can tell me&quot; 
<br /><br />and she said... 
<br /><br />&quot;Alyssa lies to the classroom, 
<br />Alyssa lies everyday at school, 
<br />Alyssa lies to the teachers 
<br />as she tries to cover every bruise&quot; 
<br /><br />My little girl laid her head down that night to go to sleep. 
<br />As I stepped out the room, I heard her say a prayer so soft and sweet 
<br />&quot;God bless my mom and my Dad 
<br />and my new friend, Alyssa 
<br />*oh*I know she needs you bad 
<br /><br />Because Alyssa lies to the classroom, 
<br />Alyssa lies everyday at school, 
<br />Alyssa lies to the teachers 
<br />as she tries to cover every bruise&quot; 
<br /><br />(bridge) 
<br /><br />I had the worst night of sleep in years 
<br />as I tried to think of a way to calm her fears 
<br />I knew just what it was I had to do *I knew exactly what I had to do* 
<br />but when we got to school on Monday I heard the news 
<br /><br />My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad 
<br />the lump in my throat grew bigger 
<br />with every question that she asked. 
<br />Until I felt the tears run down my face 
<br />and I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today 
<br /><br />'Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom 
<br />she doesn't lie anymore at school 
<br />Alyssa lies with Jesus 
<br />because there's nothin' anyone would do 
<br /><br />Tears filled my eyes when my little girl asked me why 
<br />Alyssa lies 
<br />*Oh Daddy, oh* Daddy tell me why 
<br />Alyssa lies

<br />It wasn't any secret i'd be asking for her hand
<br />I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
<br />with at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
<br /><br />- Chorus -
<br /><br />She was playing Cinderella
<br />She was riding her first bike
<br />Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
<br />Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
<br />Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
<br />In her eyes i'm Prince Charming
<br />But to him i'm just some fella
<br />riding in and stealing Cinderella
<br /><br />I leaned in towards those pictures to get a better look at one
<br />When I heard a voice behind me say &quot;Now, ain't she something, son?&quot;
<br />I said &quot;Yes, she quite a woman&quot;
<br />and he just stared at me
<br />Then I realized that in his eyes she would always be
<br /><br />Playing Cinderella
<br />Riding her first bike
<br />Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
<br />Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
<br />Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
<br />In her eyes i'm Prince Charming
<br />But to him i'm just some fella
<br />riding in and stealing Cinderella
<br /><br />He slapped me on the shoulder
<br />Then he called her in the room
<br />When she threw her arms around him
<br />That's when I could see it too
<br /><br />She was playing cinderella
<br />Riding her first bike
<br />Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
<br />Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
<br />Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
<br />He gives me a hard time
<br />I can't blame the fella
<br />I'm the one who's stealing Cinderella&quot;

<br />Last mile I pushed my truck uphill
<br />About hurt me
<br />I left my truck by the pump right where I parked it

<br />Have mercy, I was thirsty
<br />The guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be
<br />I said I don't know man, you tell me
<br /><br />It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
<br />One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
<br />Makes life complicated when it costs the same
<br />Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
<br />But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run

<br />That cooler had every brand known to man
<br />Tall boys, bottles, and aluminum cans
<br />(Aww) What a shame
<br />And it's gettin' pretty bad when you finally discover
<br />It all comes down to either one or the other
<br /><br />It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack

<br /><br />I step out of the shower steamin’ up the place
<br />Wipe off the mirror, shave my baby face Can’t help but smile, hey what can I say 
<br />I got my game on 
<br /><br />Put on my black silk shirt, my Armani suit, My custom made hat, my alligator boots, Slip my rings on my fingers, my new
<br />shades, 
<br />Ooooh I got my game on
<br /><br />Yeah I got my game on 
<br />Better hang on tight 
<br />I guarantee it’s gonna be a helluva ride
<br />I got my groove on, I got my smooth on 
<br />Yeah you ladies better watch out tonight 
<br />I got my game on 
<br /><br />Get to the club in my caddy with my custom 24’s 
<br />Flip my keys to the valet and I’m ready to roar 
<br />They’re gonna know the second I strut through the door
<br />I got my game on
<br /><br />Yeah I got my game on 
<br />Better hang on tight 
<br />I guarantee it’s gonna be a helluva ride
<br />I got my groove on, I got my smooth on 
<br />Yeah you ladies are in trouble tonight 
<br />I got my game on 
<br /><br />That little hottie at the bar 
<br />Just game me a wink 
<br />Flash my Platinum card 
<br />And buy her a drink 
<br />From that look she’s giving me son it’s a damn good thing. 
<br /><br />I got my game on 
<br />Better hang on tight 
<br />I guarantee it’s gonna be a helluva ride
<br />I got my groove on, I got my smooth on 
<br />Goin' rock star crazy tonight
<br />I got my game on 
<br /><br />Yeah I got my game on, game on now baby

<br />Puttin on that smile again
<br />Even though I know you’ve had a bad day
<br />Doin this and doin that
<br />Always puttin’ yourself last
<br />A whole lotta give and not enough take
<br /><br />But you can only be strong so long before you break…
<br /><br />So fall go on and fall apart
<br />Fall into these arms of mine
<br />Ill catch you every time you fall
<br />Go on and lose it all
<br />Every doubt every fear every worry every tear
<br />Im right here
<br />Baby fall
<br /><br />Forget about the world tonight
<br />All that’s wrong and all that’s right
<br />Lay your head on my shoulder let it fade away
<br />[FALL lyrics on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metrolyrics.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.metrolyrics.com</a>]
<br /><br />And if you wanna let go baby its okay
<br /><br />Fall go on and fall apart
<br />Fall into these arms of mine
<br />Ill catch you every time you fall
<br />Go on and lose it all
<br />Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear
<br />Im right here
<br />Baby fall
<br /><br />Hold on hold on hold on to me...
<br /><br />Fall go on and fall apart
<br />Fall into these arms of mine
<br />Ill catch you every time you fall 
<br />Go on and lose it all
<br />Every doubt, every fear, every worry, every tear
<br />Im right here
<br />Baby fall

<br /><br />Old Tom answering a hoot owls call
<br /><br />Nothing like the sound when the day breaks
<br /><br />Me and Daddy in the woods on a Saturday
<br /><br />you see his Granddaddy hunted these hills and 
<br /><br />I hope someday my kids will
<br /><br />He said, Do me a favor before i'm gone,
<br /><br />love this land and pass it on
<br /><br />Pass it on
<br /><br />Oh, he showed me how to cast a line
<br /><br />Where the white tail live and how to read their signs
<br /><br />He'd lean my gun up against a tree,
<br /><br />so he could hold a barbwire fence for me
<br /><br />Yeah I learned a lot from watching his ways,
<br /><br />like how to hunt smart and how to be safe
<br /><br />He said, one of these days son, you'll be grown
<br /><br />Remember what i told you and pass it on
<br /><br />Pass it on in the name of conservation
<br /><br />Pass it on to another generation
<br /><br />Pass it on
<br /><br />But on the day that I turned 21,
<br /><br />my Dad walked in with an old shot gun
<br /><br />He said this belonged to your grandpa
<br /><br />It's yours now son, so handle it with love
<br /><br />and pass it on
<br /><br />Pass it on in the name of conservation
<br /><br />Pass it on to another generation
<br /><br />Pass it on
<br /><br />Pass it on
<br /><br />Pass it on
<br /><br />Nothing like the sound when day breaks
<br /><br />Me and my boy in the woods on a Saturday
<br /><br />Pass it on

<br />Down in the hollows where the folks are real
<br />Livin’ with the crazzies and the old wildcats
<br />Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
<br />That’s where I’m from and I’m proud to say
<br />I’m from the country and I like it that way
<br /><br />Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
<br />You don’t need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
<br />Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
<br />We’re from the country and we like it that way
<br /><br />All day long we work in the fields
<br />Then bring it on home to a home cooked meal
<br />We love ya like Sunday, treat ya like Saturday night
<br />And when the bed gets full we can sleep in the hay (hey)
<br />We’re from the country and we like it that way
<br /><br />Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
<br />You don’t need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
<br />Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
<br />We’re from the country and we like it that way
<br /><br />Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend
<br />You don’t need an invitation, kick off your shoes come on in
<br />Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play
<br />We’re from the country
<br />We’re from the country
<br />We’re from the country and we like it that way
