Not that I am against celebrating the day, or against making your mom feel special, no I am not – I’m just against all the hype about it, and the way it has been commercialized. Exaggerated sentiments and different businesses molding public opinion in a way that makes them believe they need to buy something super expensive to please their mother is what bothers me. Most of the time, the whole idea of celebrating Mother’s Day is just for the sake of bragging and showing off to your acquaintances how expensive a gift you got for your mother.
<br /><br />People do a lot of totally unnecessary things on this day including sending gifts like <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0Z2lmdG1vdGhlci5jb20v" target="_blank">Mothers Day Flowers</a></strong> to costly dresses.. A mother is a person who can be pleased with smallest of gesture from the side of her children. You don’t have to go over the top to let your mother know you care, because being a part of her body; she knows what you feel and knows your exact sentiments for her. However, occasional gesture of love towards her is nothing bad at all, just don’t overdo it. Anna Jarvis, the woman who struggled to make Mother’s Day official actually spent the rest of her life trying to tell people not to commercialize their love for mothers the way it has been done.
<br /><br />People buy super expensive gifts and get into the pressure of doing something totally “different” and expensive on Mother’s Day. They log on to the internet and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob21ldG93bmZsb3dlcnNob3BzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Order Flowers Online</a></strong> from websites. The whole purpose of celebrating the day was to pay tribute to mothers of the world, not exactly to pomp and go flashy about it. On a totally different note, in my personal opinion, you don’t need to specify a single day to make your mom know how special she is, try being nice to her every now and then and make a difference that way. But I guess eventually we all get into the pressure of celebrating the day by doing something totally showy, I know I do!

For them, words ‘life’ and ‘wife’ are synonym meaning ‘eternal slavery’. From some time, husbands are struggling hard to lessen the very much side effects of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ob21ldG93bmZsb3dlcnNob3BzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Mothers Day Flowers</a></strong>, and celebrating Fathers Day is an example in this regard. They also planned to celebrate Mothers Day as black day but rejected doing so after realizing that it was actually going to add to the popularity of this day. If you want to know how fathers or husbands celebrate Mothers Day, just have a look at their face on this special day.
