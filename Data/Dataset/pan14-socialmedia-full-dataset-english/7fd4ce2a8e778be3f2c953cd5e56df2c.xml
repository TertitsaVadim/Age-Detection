This can be frustrating for everyone involved, but with the right approach, you can make it work for both of you. Here are some ways to be more supportive and understanding toward your girlfriend when she's experiencing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
<br /><br />1 - <strong>Mark the time on a calendar (that only you will see) when you believe she will be pre-menstrual. Do this every month.</strong> Knowing that she's pre-menstrual may help you to be more patient with her. There are several apps available on the iPhone and Andriod phones to help you track her cycle. Keep in mind, however, that many women have irregular cycles.
<br /><br />2 - <strong>Try to avoid her till it passes.</strong> There is no point in getting into an argument that you can easily avoid. Use this time to go for a ride, stay late at work or have extended jam sessions with your band. Remember to keep your cell phone off and house locked. However if avoiding her is not an option, move to the next step.
<br /><br />3 - <strong>Don't ever, ever openly attribute her emotional malaise to her period.</strong> Even if you know she's (almost) on her period, even if you see the same exact symptoms every month, keep that observation to yourself. Many women - especially when in a bad mood - will take offense to your assumption that the reason she's upset is because it's &quot;that time of the month&quot;. Since she's sensitive, she might feel like you're discrediting or dismissing her opinion by attributing it to her period.
<br /><br />4 - <strong>Be patient.</strong> Dealing with anybody on a short fuse can be trying. If she snaps at you, or does something to get under your skin, don't lose your temper and fight back. It won't do any good, and it'll probably just make things worse, possibly erupting into a huge argument over nothing. Just take a deep breath and ignore whatever she just did that bothered you. Remember that she's not normally like this, and it's only temporary. See also How to Defuse an Argument.
<br /><br />5 - <strong>Do not enable immature behavior.</strong> Being emotional does not excuse inappropriate behavior. (For example, drunkenness does not excuse offensive behavior.) Expect her to be a mature adult. If she persists in her immaturity, don't begin acting irrationally as well. Calmly, but firmly, establish limits.
<br /><br />6 - <strong>Listen to her, even if she's not making any sense.</strong> Look for what she's really telling you. If she's complaining about something that's never bothered her before, what she's really saying is &quot;I feel like crap and there's nothing I can do about it, so I'm looking for something else to change and hoping that will make me feel better.&quot;
<br /><br />7 - <strong>Don't take it personally.</strong> During this time, her emotions might get the best of her, and she might question your relationship. She might question you. As mentioned in the previous step, she's feeling helpless, and sometimes when people feel helpless they look for other things they can control, and that might mean pushing your buttons or triggering your emotions. Your best defense against this is to remain level-headed and calmly say, &quot;Ok, I understand.&quot; What you really understand is that you're still the same person she enjoyed before PMS took control, and her change in perception of you is probably temporary.
<br /><br />8 - <strong>Exercise compassion.</strong> Think about a time when physical changes made you cranky. Was there ever an instance when you weren't getting enough sleep, and you became rather abrasive as a result? Or maybe you were in the hospital, and the chronic pain made you severely irritable. Put yourself in her shoes. Not only might she be experiencing bothersome physical symptoms, but her hormones are also ebbing and flowing, making it very difficult for her to know how she feels or what she wants. Think of the effect testosterone has had on you in the past, like when you get sexually aroused, or on any occasion when you felt aggression or rage (especially in your teenage years). For that time, you feel caught up in a wave, as if you don't have control. That's probably how she feels.
<br /><br />9 - <strong>Be forgiving and reassuring.</strong> Her insecurities are likely to come up around this delicate point in her cycle, and there's the potential for a negative feedback loop: She feels insecure, so she behaves irritably, which makes you not want to be around her, which &quot;confirms&quot; her insecurity. Many girls will feel insecure about their bodies, and about your feelings for them. Try to give her a few extra compliments, and be more affectionate, even if you feel like your girlfriend is possessed by a demon that's out to ruin your week.
<br /><br />Good luck, take care <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />New research from Lloydspharmacy reveals that whilst an overwhelming number of women suffer from menstrual cramps, male partners' sympathy levels at that time of the month appear to be lacking. Although 87% of men claim to be very or fairly compassionate, a quarter of women (25%) who have suffered discomfort with 'Mother Nature's gift' say their partners are unsympathetic.
<br /><br />The survey shows that period pain plagues nine in 10 women (89%) yet one in five (19%) has suffered in silence at home because of an unsympathetic partner. However it may be a case of actions speaking louder than words as, although many men claim to be considerate, nearly half (42%) admitted they try to stay out of their partner's way when 'aunt dot' comes to stay.
<br /><br />In light of this, it is unsurprising that one in six (16%) women said that period pain has resulted in an argument with their partner.  This is especially true for those women who suffer severe pain every month, with:
<br /><br />- Nearly two thirds (61%) stating their period is extremely or very painful
<br /><br />- Half said they've been doubled over in pain
<br /><br />- One in five have been physically sick
<br /><br />- A quarter have taken sick leave from work
<br /><br />Melinda Setanoians, prescribing pharmacist at Lloydspharmacy, said: &quot;Many women clearly suffer quite badly – so much so that it appears to be affecting the harmony of their relationships. There is a wide choice of painkillers available but some women prefer an alternative to medication or a way in which to supplement it. We are the only high street retailer in the UK to offer a highly effective, drug-free period pain reliever device. It uses TENS technology to ease pain, similar to the machines that people use for back pain and that women use in the early stages of childbirth.&quot;
<br /><br />The Lloydspharmacy Period Pain Reliever uses TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) technology to alleviate pain. It works by passing harmless electrical signals into the body to relieve pain by blocking the body's pain signals and stimulating the body to produce endorphins, people's own natural pain relief.
<br /><br />Approved by Action on Pain, the Lloydspharmacy Period Pain Reliever is small, discreet and lightweight, with the main unit clipping securely to clothing or underwear.

<br /><br /><em>Posted by Prexus Swyftwynd</em>
<br /><br />I remember getting these questions regularly when I started my blog, from younger girls who hadn’t started their periods yet and from ones who recently began menstruating. Suffice to say, I’m deeply touched that girls would reach out to me, as a male, to seek such advice. I hope they always get answers from me which are helpful and act as a guide, directing them to good sources of information such as sisters, parents, guardians, relatives or close female friends who can provide more anecdotal guidance than I would be able. I haven’t gotten a question like this for a while in my daily life, because almost all of my god-sis’ or close female friends are already well into becoming experts on their own periods. The “what pad or tampon is right for me?” question probably was last asked by my youngest god-sis about 4 years ago already! The reason why I decided to write about this topic, isn’t necessarily to answer inquiries from females about how to pick their products (as I believe my reviews and highlighted articles have achieved much of that already), but rather, because a male friend of mine has opened up to the idea of wanting to learn. The other day, he approached me, asking about my knowledge on menstruation. While he does not know the extent of my “enjoyment” of menstruation, he came to me because he’s known I’ve been involved in a few serious relationships before and no doubt, has had to deal with period issues at one point or another. So for the guys, this article may be right for you!
<br /><br />So my friend, being the geek he is (like me, heh) – it was very hard for him to wrap his head around how girls pick their feminine hygiene products. To him, how can different products be so unique that it makes you want one over another? He knew that different classes and models of cars offer a variety of features, performance and such, but how can he apply this to pads and tampons – it’s confusing for him! I must’ve spent a good hour just educating him about the <strong>basics of periods</strong>, why it exists, what the function is, how often it happens, etc. let alone go into details about pads and tampons yet. After he got grounded on what menstruation is all about (and probably puked a bit in his mouth as I noticed changes of expressions whenever I went into details), I began to explain to him the two common types of menstrual protection, <strong>pads and tampons</strong>. For the sake of not exploding his brain or turning him off the conversation, I started to go over the differences between <em>disposal</em> tampons and pads. <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pads</span> were either affixed to a sanitary belt or put onto panties to absorb menstrual flow as<em> it exits the body</em>, versus a <span style="text-decoration:underline">tampon</span> which is inserted into the vagina where menstrual flow is absorbed before it exits the body. Pads when filled, are removed from the panties, rolled/folded up and then disposed in the garbage. Tampons are withdrawn from the vagina and then thrown in the garbage or flushed down the toilet. In his words, “I didn’t even know pads existed – I only hear about tampons.” and as you can see, his innocence when it came to the existence of various options and their most basic method of functionality. Unfortunately, these menstrual protection terms are sometimes even used interchangeably.
<br /><br /><strong>Then he began to ask me, “How do girls know which pad or tampon is right for her?”</strong>
<br /><br />I told him that many girls often are introduced to their first brand and type of pad or tampon by an educator, parent, guardian or sibling. It’s quite common to find in households, that the females within the household share common brands and types of products they use. To be honest, out of my group of girls, I’ve only seen one who has a very different product lines as compared to her sisters and mom. There’s nothing “wrong” with that, however, from my experience, if the mother in a household uses brand X, then the rest of the girls will likely<span style="text-decoration:underline"> begin</span> and<em> continue</em>  to use brand X as well. However, picking a product is all a matter of <strong>personal preference</strong> and unless you have an over-controlling Asian mother, whether a daughter chooses to use pads, tampons or whatever brand is usually up to them. For some of the more adventurous girls, they may reach out to other types and brands of products through her friends or through her own willingness to experiment with different products. Some girls however, are forced to search for new products if their flow demands that they switch or should they have a particular reaction to the product they’re currently using. I do know a few of my girls suddenly began having allergies to products they’ve been using for years and had to switch products afterward. Allergies may be one or a combination of companies changing the composition of their products or over time, a girl developing sensitivity to one or more of the elements within the product. Just like buying a TV, we often hear from others which one they think is “the best” – then we find out for ourselves whether that’s true or not! Just likes pads and tampons, most people make decisions based on what they hear, see and perceive. It’s almost impossible to learn whether a feminine hygiene option is right <strong>until trying</strong> it!
<br /><br /><strong>Here’s where it gets difficult for him – trying to understand all the different attributes which separate one product from another. So then he asked me, “What is it about those wings I keep on hearing about? If thin pads are so much more comfortable, why do thick pads exists?”</strong>
<br /><br />So for a guy who didn’t know the existence of pads and the difference between pads and tampons, I didn’t find it shocking to hear this question. I knew that the concept of “wings” to him would be beyond his grasp, does it help make a girl fly? I explained to him that wings were meant to help <em>keep the pad in place and conform to the shape/movement of the body and panties</em> and that it also acted as a<em> last ditch effort to prevent menstrual flow from leaving the side</em> of the pad. I happened to have a pad with wings in my car, so I opened it up for him to take a look and of course without panties, I couldn’t demonstrate to him the application of wings underneath the crotch area, but I managed with a bit of visual description to give him an idea that wings extend from the side of the pad is is wrapped around the crotch of the underwear, that way, it secures itself against the panties and allow movements and shifting to synchronize with the pad in place.
<br /><br />He was already furrowing his eyebrows at me because who would’ve thought of something like “wings” on a sanitary product? He asked me if there were more “attributes” of a pad or tampon that makes one competitor’s product different from another… I sighed and told him, “yes, lots” and he rolled his eyes at me. Of course having the mindset of a keep, I actually used a very laughable analogy to explain all the attributes of pads to him in relevance to an RPG game. I told him since he’s so familiar with RPG’s, think about that a character is made of many “attributes”, strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, willpower, etc. and compare that to a pad with lengths, thickness, absorbency, width, wings, etc. He nodded in agreement with my very <strong>geeky analogy</strong>.
<br /><br /><strong>Length</strong> of a pad, what is it for? Well the length of the pad denotes how long the coverage area between your belly button to your lower back. Essentially, longer pads are usually designed for women who have heavier flows and thus, allows the pad to catch flow more easily and to disbursed it over a larger area. Sometimes, longer pads were designed for larger sized women, such as when the Always Maximum Protection pads were marketed, they were labelled for extra heavy flows and for women who were “size 14+”. Shorter pads are usually designed for lighter days and with longer pads designed for overnight use or heavier flows. In Canada, companies usually use “slender, regular, long, overnight, etc.” terminology to denote the length of the pad. In Asia, it’s common to use metric measurement such as “mm” or “cm” to denote the lengths rather than a generalized label of the length.
<br /><br /><strong>Width</strong> of a pad is similar to length in the sense that it’s a measurement of how much side-to-side coverage there is and is usually dependent on the flow-purpose of the pad. Some brands keep their widths the same and simply make pads longer to make a “regular” into an “overnight” pad. Some brands such as Stayfree (which I’m a big fan of) will make pads designed for heavier and overnight use with a larger width, as menstrual flow will often go to the edges during the night when one is sleeping, rather than day-use where most people are sitting or standing or at least in a position where the flow will drip right into the center of the pad and stay there. Remember that width can sometimes be compensated for in the event of pads with larger wings.
<br /><br /><strong>Absorbency</strong> usually defines the capacity of menstrual flow that a pad is capable of absorbing and in Canada, the absorbancy falls in-line with the length and under the description of “slender, regular, long, etc.” depending on the manufacturer. Either way, <strong>absorbency is not standardized</strong> like tampons are for pads. A “regular” absorbency pad by one company may not absorb the same amount as “regular” from another. Absorbency often varies depending on the technology used in the pad, some of which are proprietary. For instance, the big 3 companies in Canada that sells pads, Stayfree, Kotex and Always have various lines of products with different technologies. Stayfree has a new Thermocontrol line, Kotex has the Micromax core in their U by Kotex line, and Always has the Infincel beads in their Infinity line which different from their standard lines. I usually refer to these as the “premium lines” – a description which I adopted from Asia pads and tampons. Even comparing absorbency of a “regular” sized Always pad in their original line versus a “regular” sized Always Infinity pad, the Infinity one will absorb a lot more! Absorbency is very hard to define for pads because there’s just so many other factors involved.
<br /><br /><strong>Wings</strong> and No Wings, this is always confusing to explain to guys about why any girl would want to use pads without wings. Let’s face it, us guys drive all different types of cars, some people like spoilers and some do not. Likewise, not every girl needs to like wings on their pads, as much as it might sound contrary to not want something that<strong> helps</strong>. Wings can sometimes cause irritation and let’s not forget that wings aren’t always helpful. For some women, their body is much more attuned to pads with no wings and they feel that their pad already conforms well to their body without the assistance of wings. These are all legitimate personal choices! Furthermore, let’s not forget there’s a cost-savings here because pads with wings will usually either, a) cost more, or <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> come fewer in a equivalent sized pack as compared to ones without wings.
<br /><br />Thin or thick? Naturally, one would like to assume that thin pads is always more comfortable and such is not the case. Thick pads sometimes can provide a comfort, like a pillow and also provides a closer body fit. Thick pads usually absorb better than their thin equivalency, however, with better technologies offered, sometimes thin pads can even outperform thick ones. Suffice to say, thick pads still offer a peace-of-mind to some women, therefore, thick pads should not be overlooked at being outdated or “not cool”. Feminine hygiene is a personal choice which is meant to provide both menstrual protection AND a feeling of security as psychological wellness matters too, especially during sensitive period times! Thin pads because of how paper-like they are often make more noise when walking, usually squishing and scratching noises. Thicker pads usually don’t have this problem, but then again, this is on a brand-to-brand basis. Thick pads for some can pose an uncomfortable feeling and usually anti-pad users will say they “feel like diapers” and sure enough, thick pads can get in the way of physical activities because the feeling of the pad is “always there.” Thick pads often will show bulging through tight pants and such, so there is a lack of discreteness if that is important. Thick pads usually are used at home and at night though for that reason when you have your own privacy and where “showing” is less of a concern.
<br /><br />By now, his eyes are already rolled back into his skull because as short as it was for you to read this on my blog, the conversation was a lot longer. I had to then tell him that now we’re done<em> talking about pads</em>, let’s move onto tampons!
<br /><br />Absorbency for tampons in Canada and the US have standardized amounts of menstrual flow they are designed to absorb in a single tampon and are as follows:
<br /><br />Junior absorbency – less than 6 grams (Approximately 5 grams equals one teaspoon.)
<br /><br />o Regular absorbency – 6 to 9 grams
<br />o Super absorbency – 9 to 12 grams
<br />o Super plus absorbency – 12 to 15 grams
<br />o Ultra absorbency – 15 to 18 grams
<br /><br />Of course even between standardized tampon absorption amounts, girls often find their experiences with various brands to be quite different. Because tampons have the potential to cause TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome), absorbency ratings are regulated to protect users. Using the lowest possible absorbency to meet the needs of one’s menstrual flow is the best option. Absorbency doesn’t necessarily define the length or width of the tampon, but does<em> influence</em> it. On the same note, because tampons are worn internally, designers of tampons must create them in such a shape, size and way where it’s comfortable and is easy to insert/withdraw.
<br /><br /><strong>Expansion</strong> is something that is not usually talked about, but is something that’s integral to how well the tampon performs when inserted into the vagina. Tampons can expand in various “shapes” when inside the vagina, width-wise, length-wise or into “flower” type shapes, which help conform to the inside of the vagina. Think of a tampon as a plug and you will realize that the way tampons expand impact how well the tampon catches menstrual flow and whether “gaps” between the tampon and vaginal wall will occur, thus allowing flow to leak past the tampon. Expansion however, can equally cause discomfort so that’s why finding a tampon that has an expansion method which matches one’s body and still provides expected protection is integral.
<br /><br /><strong>Applicator or non-applicator</strong> tampons pose an impact to the environment and sometimes to the sanity of the girl. Girls who live by applicators usually have one of two reasons, 1) they don’t want to have their fingers so close to their bloody vagina or 2) feel it’s easier to insert. Because applicators add an extra piece of the overall size of the tampon, applicator tampons need to be sold in larger boxes/packages (yes, even the compact sized ones) and add additional trash to our landfills. However, some just can’t get over the idea that their fingers would need to become very intimate and close to their vagina and is unsanitary/unhygienic, therefore non-applicator tampons scare them. I have had real-life experiences with inserting both non-applicator and applicator tampons and honestly, I have preference towards non-applicator tampons no problem.
<br /><br /><strong>Type of applicator</strong> usually falls between 2 materials, <span style="text-decoration:underline">cardboard</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">plastic</span>. Both cause an environmental impact, however, cardboard because it’s usually biodegradable, has less environmental impact. Plastic however is often known to “glide in” much smoother. However, plastic applicator tips are often flanged to allow the tampon to be pushed through and thus, pinching is known to happen. Pinching already sucks when it happens on your hands, let alone when it’s in a sensitive area such as the vagina! Applicators can also sometimes have features and designs on it which assist in insertion, easy-to-hold grip/shape or compact form. The purpose of an applicator is to allow a tampon to be “planted” directly into the vagina. The applicator plunge is pushed, the tampon exits into the vagina and settles in, then the applicator is withdrawn from the body. The result is a string sewn into the center of the tampon which allows for withdrawal and the string stays outside the body. Some women like to tuck the string between the legs, labia or even inside their vagina.
<br /><br />I noticed that after all this information, I think that his mind was already at the tip of exploding. It’s a lot of information for a guy to stomach at one time, especially because he was the mild and shy type and to listen to my repeat of “pad”, “tampon” and “vagina” it made his face flush red. There were times I had to repeat myself so he understood concepts surrounding tampons and how applicators worked and such. I was more than happy to show him as I happened to have bought a box of U by Kotex Click tampons in my trunk. Seeing the visual really helped him grasp the idea of tampons and what the differences are between pads and tampons. One last thing I touched-base on because I knew talking about disposal pads and tampons already gave him the shivers at the thought of menstrual fluid (and that when pads and tampons are soaked up, the flow is actually less than it<em> appears</em>) saturating a pad and tampon. An average menstrual flow isn’t all that bad in terms of actual amount, but when we visually see a soaked pad and tampon, it almost looks like a someone’s arm was cut off by a saw! I skimmed through alternative pad and tampon options such as menstrual cups and cloth pads and by then, I could see the air of discomfort rising in him. With that, I stopped but then there’s still much for ME to learn about reusable products which I want to do before writing more about them.
<br /><br />Recently, I’ve been very fascinated with <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21lbmlubWVuc3RydWF0aW9uLndvcmRwcmVzcy5jb20vbHVuYXBhZHMuY29t" target="_blank">Lunapads</a></strong> and really want to make a donation AND purchase a set for testing and perhaps for my interested girls or bebe! So there you have it guys, if you ever wonder how much that girls have to think about when choosing a product right for them, you realize why the aisles are so damn big and complex! Hopefully though, you will also realize that it’s not a trivial matter at all and that picking the right product really helps a girl get through her day accident-free and with a peace-of-mind! If you’re not afraid of your own menstrual flow, I’d REALLY recommend you switching to reusable products because they’re great for the environment, economical, healthier for your body and comfortable because they use REAL cotton and not synthesized materials!

<br /><br />If you are like most women, you have probably experienced menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) at one time or another. For some women, menstrual cramps are debilitating, while others experience only mild discomfort during their period.
<br /><br />Menstrual cramps may be primary or secondary.<strong> Primary dysmenorrhea</strong> occurs most often in young women who have just begun their menstrual cycles and often becomes less severe when a woman reaches her mid-twenties or after she has given birth .<strong> Secondary dysmenorrhea</strong> is diagnosed when menstrual cramps are caused by other conditions such as endometriosis, fibroid tumors, pelvic adhesions, and ovarian cysts or by the use of an interuterine device (IUD) for birth control.
<br /><br />Menstrual cramps are thought to be related to a hormone-like, naturally occurring substance called prostaglandin, which causes the uterus to contract. If a woman does not ovulate, it is unlikely that she will encounter cramps during her period. For this reason, physicians often prescribe oral contraceptives to ease painful periods. However, you should be aware that birth control pills cause abnormal bleeding in some women.
<br /><br /><strong>How Can You Beat Menstrual Cramps?</strong>
<br /><br />Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen sodium, used around the clock as soon as you notice the first sign of your period can help to reduce the severity of cramps in many women by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins. Of course, be sure not to exceed the daily maximum as described on the medication's label. Acetaminophen(e.g.-Tylenol) will help the pain, but it does not have the effect on prostagladins.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Regular physical activity</span> often reduces cramping in some women.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Natural progesterone</span> may help reduce the symptoms that are causing menstrual cramps.
<br /><br />Supplementing your diet with zinc and calcium has been found to reduce cramps, bloating, and related <span style="text-decoration:underline">PMS</span> symptoms.
<br /><br />Herbal remedies, such as Viburnum prunifolium, Scutellaria spp. and Cimicifuga racemosa, have an antispasmodic effect that may reduce some menstrual cramps. Other useful herbs include cramp bark, squaw vine, unicorn root, bromelain, evening primrose oil, and blue cohosh.
<br /><br />Try taking a warm bath and using aromatherapy or a heating pad on your lower abdomen or back. If you don't have a heating pad, a heating pad substitute can be made at home. 
<br />How to Make a Heating Pad
<br /><br />Relaxing and letting those around you know that you are not feeling yourself will help by reducing the <span style="text-decoration:underline">stress</span> of your everyday life that may contribute to your menstrual cramps.

<br /><br />My name is bowser347. I am a 20 year old female and I have extremely painful cramps during my menstrual cycle. I begin getting cramps about a week before my period starts, and the cramps become much worse once I actually get my period. I got my first period when I was 13 years old, without much significant pain. I continued to get my period, somewhat regularly (I generally get my period on the same day, but at times it can be three to four days late or early). I didn't have any kind of intense pain during my menstrual cycle between the ages of 13 and 16. 
<br /><br />When I turned 17, I began to notice a significant amount of pain during my period. Over the last four years, this pain has gotten progressively worse. At this point, I cannot function at all during my period. I get such severe cramps that I often can't move at all, I can't even leave my bed. I have passed out due to the pain, though this has only happened five times. I often throw up because of the pain, and have very painful bowel movements. I can't control my body temperature and get chills, or get so hot I'm pouring sweat. The pain becomes so bad I can't talk, eat, or drink anything (whatever I do eat or drink won't stay down). This has certainly affected the quality of my life, and now the pain has gotten so terrible that I am missing almost a week of school every month. 
<br /><br />About a year ago, my doctor told me that I had a Vitamin D deficiency. I read somewhere that this can cause menstrual pain. My dr gave me a prescription for Vit D, which I took, but I saw no significant improvement in my period pain. I now take a multi-vitamin every day and also supplement that with liquid Vitamin D pills. I have been taking 4 vitamin D pills a day during my period, and one multi-vitamin. It seems to be helping, only slightly though. Can my body really be so deficient in Vitamin D that I need to take 4 pills a day to see improvement in my health? I'm essentially getting 400% the Daily Value of vitamin D. 
<br /><br />In all other aspects, I believe my period is basically normal. I don't have a very heavy period, and the blood is a healthy color. I have noticed that there are sometimes &quot;clots&quot; in my menstruation, I don't know what this is or if it could indicate something wrong. 
<br /><br />I have gone to a 2 gynecologists, my primary physician, Drs at my school, and have gone to the emergency room 4 times (mainly because I throw up so much that I start to have blood in my vomit, which freaks me out, but also because I can't deal with the pain). My primary dr put me on oxycodone for the pain, but it just knocked me out. Even though the pain was gone, I still wasn't able to go to school or function, and that's what I'm trying to do--be able to function on my period again. 
<br /><br />Could I have endometriosis? Or is this just dysmenorrhea? Could my period pain have to do with my vitamin deficiency? Is there anything I can do to lessen the pain other than using pain killers? 
<br /><br />PS. My dr also told me that I have good Iron levels, so I don't think I'm anemic though I don't know. I also had an x-ray of my uterus and was told it was fine, I don't know how you know if you have endometriosis or not....But please let me know what you think or just give me any kind of pertinent advice. Thank you!

<br /><br />that rapidly change from being contently happy to being depressed or angry. Consequently, experts say these mood swings, which are attributable to their menstrual periods, can be helped if they seek medical help, reports <strong>Sade Oguntola</strong>.
<br /><br />Almost every woman will experience mood swings to some degree during their lifetimes, especially during their menstrual cycles. Mood swings can become a big problem due to their uncontrollable intensity and frequency during menstruation. Changes in a woman’s temper can be very unpredictable and frustrating and they not only impact on her but her family, especially when such changes are severe.
<br /><br />Some women have all the luck. They go through menstruation each month without ever suffering pain or discomfort. Others are not as fortunate and these women are the ones prone to suffer from mood swings.  They suffer from severe menstrual mood swings, which make them unable to control their erratic emotional reactions.
<br /><br />Menstrual mood swings which make women to change from being contently happy to being depressed; unusually sensitive to rejection, social withdrawal feeling overwhelmed or angry; adversely affects their personal relationships because unexplained passionate reactions are difficult to live with.
<br /><br />Why does menstrual mood swings occur? Menstrual mood swings are caused by the changing hormone levels that occur during a woman’s menstrual cycles. Unlike other mood problems that may be caused by bad circumstances or unpleasant situations, as a woman’s progesterone levels fall they begin to experience the dreaded menstrual mood swings.
<br /><br />A woman of child-bearing age will experience a menstrual cycle approximately every 28 days. Menstruation is often referred to as menses. There are several phases that the body goes through to complete the menstrual cycle, and it is necessary for a woman’s body to go through these phases in order to reproduce. During the menstruation cycle, women have increased levels of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone.
<br /><br />The hormone oestrogen is what affects mood. Oestrogen is a “feel-good” hormone because of the way it affects the brain. This hormone gives increased levels of neurotransmitters to the brain. These chemicals include endorphins, enkephalins and serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical that has a direct influence on emotions and appetite. The levels of these chemicals increase in preparation for pregnancy but decline when implantation does not occur. The loss of these chemicals causes mood changes, often referred to as Pre-Menstrual Syndrome, or PMS.
<br /><br />Moods during the menstrual cycle swing from elation to depression, and the ranges for each woman can be mild to severe. A condition known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD, can happen when emotional and behavioural symptoms become intense. Some of these symptoms are rage, violence, sudden bursts of anger, severe depression and panic attacks. What’s more, the cramps bloating, headaches, tension, breast tenderness, food cravings and a feeling of abdomen fullness which occur during menstruation can contribute to how mood is affected during the menstrual cycle. At times these cramps can be extremely painful.
<br /><br />Mood swings, also known as phase mood changes, may have natural or unnatural causes. Receiving good and bad news at the same moment certainly warrants a mood swing. But there are also times when a person experiences mood swings for no apparent reason. When this happens, you might want to consult a physician about it as such mood swings could be a symptom of a more serious
<br /><br />Ironically, mood swing occurs in all women, especially close to the time of menopause according to Dr Akin-tunde Odukogbe, a consultant obstetrician and gyneacologist, University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Oyo State.
<br /><br />“Close to menopause, there are wide fluctuations in the levels of the hormones controlling menstruation-oestrogen and progesterone. These have been known to affect the mood very much,” Dr Odukogbe said. “Even in the middle aged women, there are times when you have a lot of social issues concerning children, husband, material things and achievement of laid down plans, all confusing the picture.”
<br /><br />Teenagers are not an exception to mood swings either. According to Dr Odukogbe, the hormonal changes that cause the mood swing might be pronounced in adolescent as well because they have just reached puberty.
<br /><br />Puberty is the time when the body system of an adolescent is maturing and as such, the fluctuations in hormonal changes might be more. For instance, some adolescents experience cessation in their menses and in such a situation, their mothers, thinking that they are pregnant takes them to see a doctor, he stated.
<br /><br />“You can imagine the psychological problems that attend the girl and her parents,” declared Dr Odukogbe.
<br /><br />However, “the psychological problems in the younger age also need to be taken into consideration because these are girls that are developing. They have issues they might not have been well prepared for, causing a lot of crisis. And also, they have attention from the male folks and that may be very confusing for some of them.”
<br /><br />But why do women approaching menopause experience hormonal changes? According to the medical expert, “the problem is that of the ageing of their body system. Their body system is also not performing well at that time, so this is a critical issue.”
<br /><br />Obviously, there are a variety of causes of mood swings in people of all ages. Irrespective of what may be causing the mood swing, Dr Odukogbe advised seeing a medical doctor for help. According to him, there are well-people’s clinics run in many hospitals, including UCH, Ibadan, where issues around menopause one of the causes of mood swing can be talked about.
<br /><br />“They are not sick people and we do not treat them as such. They are people who may need to understand their body, understand their sexuality and such changes which occur when approaching menopause and how to deal with such changes,” he said. “Of course, there would be some of such people in whom actual diseases may be detected as being responsible for their mood swing.”
<br /><br />For instance, with medical problems such as bipolar depression and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, mood swings are prevalent symptoms, sometimes because they find it extremely difficult to achieve certain things in life, things that may come naturally to other people, or because they do not understand the cause of their inadequacies.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, expert’s advice on coping with many unpleasant menstrual side effects such as mood swings include the following: living a healthy lifestyle to ensure a healthy and fit body  through  eating balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables; regular exercises, avoidance of consumption of too much caffeine or alcohol; adequate sleep and cessation of smoking.

<br /><br />All indigenous cultures around the world revered women for their ability to birth Life! In order to birth Life, we must first Menstruate!
<br /><br /><em>In native cultures</em>
<br />Menstruation was known
<br />as the time when the veil between the worlds is thinnest
<br /><br /><em>In native cultures</em>
<br />Menstruation was considered
<br />a time when women have access to the Divine
<br /><br /><em>In native cultures</em>
<br />Women had special places to go to when they Flowed:
<br />Moon Huts, Moon Lodges, Red Tents.
<br /><br />It was understood that when a woman bleeds
<br />she is in a heightened state,
<br />and cannot be bothered with everyday tasks!
<br /><br />I<em>n native cultures</em>
<br />Women spent their bleeding days in Moon Lodges
<br />talking, crafting, resting, dreaming, laughing, crying, nap-ping, chatting, being quiet, simply having time-off to re-charge their batteries!
<br /><br /><em>In native cultures</em>
<br />Women in Moon Lodges dreamed prophesies for their tribes
<br /><br /><em>In native cultures</em>
<br />People brought questions to the bleeding women:
<br />From personal matters, to elders asking whether to wage war…
<br />The answers that Bleeding Women received in dreams,
<br />were followed with reverence!
<br /><br /><em>In today’s cultures</em>
<br />Most women have nowhere to go to when they bleed,
<br />most women act as if their bleeding time is no different than any other time,
<br />most women don’t rest or renew their energy when they bleed,
<br />most women don’t talk about what they need when they bleed,
<br />many women think their blood is gross…

		<document id="ab87d61d034e106cac9316964feb464d" url=""><![CDATA[Some Men Know Menstrual Voices When They Hear Them<br/><br/>Great news! A recent study in the journal Ethology reveals that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2plemViZWwuY29tLzU4NDU1NzAveW91LWNhbm5vdC10ZWxsLWlmLWEtd29tYW4taXMtb3Z1bGF0aW5nLWp1c3QtYnktdGFsa2luZy10by1oZXI_" target="_blank">men can detect from a woman’s voice whether she is menstruating</a>. Psychologists Nathan Pipitone from Adams State College and Gordon Gallup from SUNY Albany recorded 10 women counting from one to five, at four different points in their menstrual cycles. Three groups of guys listened to the recordings. The first group was instructed to guess which of the four clips was made during the female speaker’s period. Though the men had a 25 percent likelihood, statistically, of choosing the correct recording, they flagged the menstrual voice 35 percent of the time—a significant difference, according to Pipitone and Gallup. (Perhaps the best part of this study is its coinage of the phrase “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3BzY2kuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDEyLTAxL2hvdy1tZW4tY2FuLWRlY29kZS13b21lbnMtbWVuc3RydWFsLWN5Y2xlcw__" target="_blank">menstrual voices</a>,” which Edith Zimmerman poetically explicated in the Hairpin last week. I’m reminded a bit of Coleridge’s “ancestral voices prophesying war,” from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbmxpbmUtbGl0ZXJhdHVyZS5jb20vY29sZXJpZGdlLzY0MC8_" target="_blank">Kubla Khan</a>, which makes sense, because “menstrual voices” often also prophesy war.)
<br /><br />The second group of men had the same task, except that researchers replaced the recordings made when the women were closest to ovulation with recordings made on a less fertile day. This was meant to soften the contrast between the sexpot ovulation voice and the “Leave me alone; I’m on my period” voice. Again, the guys correctly guessed the menstruation recording 34 percent of the time. 
<br /><br />The third group had no idea they were participating in a study on fertility. They were asked to select, from the four recordings, the most “unattractive” voice—and yes, they picked the period voice 34 percent of the time. According to Pipitone, giveaways included lower pitch, quality, and mood. In fact, he said, all three of the test groups “seemed to determine the menstrual voices by picking the most unattractive voice.”
<br /><br />When I came across this study yesterday, my <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9GYWNlcGFsbQ__" target="_blank">face-palm</a> was followed by a melancholy moment. Perhaps studies on the baggage of the human voice—what it can tell us without the help of words—are starting to say more about our nostalgia for old-fashioned communication than about what the researchers actually hope to prove. (Women’s voices sound slightly crankier during menstruation? Whoop-de-doo.) In a culture where Gchatting or emailing the co-worker 2 feet away comes as second nature to many of us, it seems as though unlocking the special properties of spoken language has become an elegiac pursuit, not just a scientific one. In honor of classic oral communication, we’ll let this particular<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zbGF0ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZG91YmxlX3gvZG91YmxleC8yMDEwLzA5L29oX3BsZWFzZV90ZWxsX21lX21vcmVfYWJvdXRfbXlfZWdncy5odG1s" target="_blank">inane ovulation study slide</a>.
