<br />All of us are aware of the importance of both a good <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXJlbnRzd2l0aGF0dGl0dWRlLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvbWVtYmVyLzEwMTc3Lw__" target="_blank">diet</a> and physical exercises but what most of the people don't know is the correlation between both these aspects of fitness. People are still unaware of the underlying connection between following a healthy diet and exercising regularly. There are some facts explained below that will bring to light the relevance of exercising while on a diet and vice versa. If we are on a diet it is essential to perform some physical activities and conversely if we are taking up some physical activities we need to be careful about what eat. Only exercising cannot bring us the coveted fitness and dieting alone cannot impart good health. There are two basic reasons that can support this fact. It is possible to bring down the amount of cortisol in the body with the help of exercises. The function to build fats in the body is performed by cortisol and its responsibility is mainly to form the abdominal fat. Cortisol sometimes brings about many undesirable changes in the body which leads to physical and mental illnesses. If you perform regular exercises you can reduce the level of cortisol in the body and this will eventually contribute in weight loss. 
<br />When one performs physical exercises it is very essential to maintain a proper ratio of macro nutrients in order to help the body recovers from loss of energy which accompanies rigorous exercises. Therefore it is necessary that one should take care of providing the body with adequate amount of nutrients while exercising in order to ensure sound health and fitness. Rest and recovery both hold much importance when one is working out. It is recommended by medical practitioners to take chocolate drink after work out because it is replete with proteins, carbohydrates and water. It needs to be noted that chocolate drink should be taken within 30 minutes of work out so that it provides the desired recovery. It should not be ignored that warming up and cooling down before and after exercise respectively is very importantly for preventing injury. This prevents the risk of injuries. 
<br />An individual performing exercises right from his young age has more chances of securing his health than a person beginning to perform it in his old age. Therefore to accomplish the aim of maintaining good healthy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teWZvdXJ0aGlyZHMuY29tL3VzZXIucGhwP2lkPTcxNTg_" target="_blank">cookie diet</a>, it is essential to start working out early in life rather than beginning late in life. But merely doing moderate exercises cannot assure one of a healthy life. It is also important to perform vigorous exercises rather than light exercises to obtain optimum benefits. People easily fall prey to certain myths regarding exercises and are discouraged not to take up exercising. Myths such as one should approach a doctor before bringing about radical changes in exercise methods is highly discouraging. They say it is vital in order to be safe from any injury. But this is considered as baseless by many of the fitness experts. People following fitness religiously sometimes have to face obstacles of such kind. But one should not get discouraged by them since the advantages of exercise are immense.
