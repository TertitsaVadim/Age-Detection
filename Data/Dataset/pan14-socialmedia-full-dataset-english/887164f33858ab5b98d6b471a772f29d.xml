Water-resistant digital camera cases can be found in various designs and qualities. Cases made particularly for the camera will be most efficient, even though a generic design that matches most cameras, this kind of as Aquapac Water-resistant Camera Case, is also very efficient.Make a case out of plastic wrap.

Cover the lens with a small bit of glass to protect it.Make a situation using an unlubricated, very clear, latex condom. Place a cut-off end of an empty paper towel or toilet paper roll around the lens to create a protecting barrier. Slip a condom around the camera and tie a knot at the end.

Having the perfect long hairstyles or short hairstyles may be the key to looking your best. Not only do you need to have the right long hairstyle or short hairstyle for your face shape, but matching your hairstyle to a night out on the town or a day at work should always be on your mind. Whether you're playing in a tournament or taking a stroll on a sunlit afternoon, you have a choice between numerous long hairstyle and short hairstyles.  In case you have long hair and find yourself putting it in a bun or ponytail most of the time, you may need some hairstyle advice. <br /><br />Long hairstyles can be tricky in the event you don't know what you are doing. This can be especially true when you have long and curly hair. I keep my long, curly hair detangled and unfrizzy with the line of Curly Hair Solutions products. Before I style my hair for a night out or day shopping with friends, I use my Curly Hair Solutions products. After using my Curly Hair solutions silk shampoo and conditioner, I like to make use of their Slip Detangler to loosen knots and get rid of fly-away hair. The line of Curly Hair Solutions products also includes a product known as Re-Mane Straight that assists in straightening hair while blow-drying. It seals the hair cuticle and protects the hair from heat and stretching. <br /><br />Among the great long hairstyles I like to use whether I'm going to work or going out for the night is the half-up and half-down style. You'll need a top quality clip or hair tie. For evening, I like to use an embellished clip which will twinkle against my hair. During the day, I use simple hair elastic that is the same color as my hair. You'll need to separate the top portion of your hair from the bottom, using your ears as a guide. You can gather the hair at the back, or you can brush the hair from front to back, making it smooth. Either way, fasten your own hair with the clip or elastic and you are ready for action. Numerous hair stylists list this as one of their easiest of long hairstyles. <br /><br />Another option in the many long hairstyles offered is really a fancy ponytail. This entails fastening the hair at the nape of the neck, not the top. You can fasten hair loosely having a fancy elastic or hair tie or even a sash. I often use a neckerchief in a vibrant color to add flair. This hairstyle is elegant, but can be fun with the right accessory. Many ladies think that short hairstyles need to be boring. Yet again, the use of the right accessory is important. Short hairstyles are difficult because there's not much hair to work with. Whether or not your hair is curly or straight, you can use a great headband to accent the hair. Headbands are more well-known than ever and are available in a number of styles, such as leather and silk. <br /><br />Even though I have long hair, I like to wear a silk headband or head scarf to help keep my hair out of my eyes, but also to add distinction and interest to my hair. The perfect accessory can make the difference between mousey brown hair and the wow factor. Numerous ladies are frightened of using accessories because they think that they will be too flashy. This really is exactly the opposite. A great accessory like a head scarf, clip or embellished comb may add an incredible amount of glamour to both short hairstyles and long hairstyles. Don't restrict your creativity in regards to short hairstyles or long hairstyles. Go for it!<br /><br />If you want more information on    <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewhairstylesblog.com%2Fhairstyles2011%2Fedgy-2011-hairstyles-for-women%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://newhairstylesblog.com/hairstyles2011/edgy-2011-hairstyles-for-women/</a>   don't read just rehashed articles online to avoid getting ripped off.
