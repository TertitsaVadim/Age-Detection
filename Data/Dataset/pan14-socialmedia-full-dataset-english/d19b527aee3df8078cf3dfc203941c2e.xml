<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />Till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood I'm in.
<br /><br />Let us pay for you!
<br /><br />Don't &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />Say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />Honestly, I think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. Or my t-shirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hot Chris Brown, tyrese, or Denzel is in front of us. It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful?&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />On the other hand I'm not saying I wouldn't like it either ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, don't wait for him to change. Ditch his sorry, disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they're doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;I love you&quot;...and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repost this
<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- ~~~~~
<br /><br />*Holding Hands
<br />Girls: If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of times.
<br />Guys: Grab it if it happens more than once.
<br /><br />*Cuddling
<br />Girls: When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold
<br />Guys: Automatically move closer to her.
<br /><br />*Movies
<br />Girls: During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
<br />Guys: Lift her chin up and kiss her.
<br /><br />*Loving each other
<br /><br />Guys: When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her too... And mean it.
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars
<br /><br />Girls: When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
<br />Guys: Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.
<br /><br />By 12 am tonight your one true love will realize how much they want you.
<br /><br />guys repost as:&quot;guys point of view&quot;
<br />girls report as:&quot;this is cute&quot;

<br /><br />My name is Chris
<br /><br />I am three,
<br /><br />My eyes are swollen
<br /><br />I cannot see,
<br /><br />I must be stupid
<br /><br />I must be bad,
<br /><br />What else could have made
<br /><br />My daddy so mad?
<br /><br />I wish I were better
<br /><br />I wish I weren't ugly,
<br /><br />Then maybe my mommy
<br /><br />Would still want to hug me.
<br /><br />I can't do a wrong
<br /><br />I can't speak at all
<br /><br />Or else im locked up
<br /><br />All day long.
<br /><br />When im awake im all alone
<br /><br />The house is dark
<br /><br />My folks aren't home
<br /><br />When my mommy does come home
<br /><br />I'll try and be nice,
<br /><br />So maybe i'll just get
<br /><br />One whipping tonight.
<br /><br />I just heard a car
<br /><br />My daddy is back
<br /><br />From Charlie's bar.
<br /><br />I hear him curse
<br /><br />My name is called
<br /><br />I press myself
<br /><br />Against the wall
<br /><br />I try to hide
<br /><br />From his evil eyes
<br /><br />I'm so afraid now
<br /><br />I'm starting to cry
<br /><br />He finds me weeping
<br /><br />Calls me ugly words,
<br /><br />He says its my fault
<br /><br />He suffers at work.
<br /><br />He slaps and hits me
<br /><br />And yells at me more,
<br /><br />I finally get free
<br /><br />And run to the door
<br /><br />He's already locked it
<br /><br />And i start to bawl,
<br /><br />He takes me and throws me
<br /><br />Against the hard wall
<br /><br />I fall to the floor
<br /><br />With my bones nearly broken,
<br /><br />And my daddy continues
<br /><br />With more bad words spoken,
<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry!&quot;, I scream
<br /><br />But its now much to late
<br /><br />His face has been twisted
<br /><br />Into a unimaginable shape
<br /><br />The hurt and the pain
<br /><br />Again and again
<br /><br />O please God, have mercy!
<br /><br />O please let it end!
<br /><br />And he finally stops
<br /><br />And heads for the door
<br /><br />While i lay there motionless
<br /><br />Brawled on the floor
<br /><br />My name is chris
<br /><br />I am three,
<br /><br />Tonight my daddy
<br /><br />Murdered me
<br /><br />And you can help
<br /><br />Sickens me top the soul,
<br /><br />And if you read this
<br /><br />and don't pass it on
<br /><br />I pray for your forgiveness
<br /><br />Because you would have to be
<br /><br />One heartless person
<br /><br />To not be effected
<br /><br />By this Poem
<br /><br />And because you are effected,
<br /><br />Do something about it!
<br /><br />So all I ask you to do
<br /><br />Is pass this on!
<br /><br />IF YOU ARE AGAINST CHILD ABUSE

<br />If I'm not skinny enough for you to see my ribs. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If I'm not pretty enough to be &quot;your girl&quot;. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry... 
<br />my boobs aren't big enough to &quot;satisfy&quot; you. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If I'm not a playboy model so I don't act like a porn star for you. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If i don't have a dream body that turns you on. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If I'm too short for you. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If i won't drop down to my knees to get you to like me. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If my hair isn't just the way you like it. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry.. 
<br />If I'm not the &quot;hottest&quot; girl you have ever seen. 
<br /><br />But most of all... 
<br /><br />I'm sorry that most guys can't accept a girl for who they really are. Beauty dies with time but a good heart will always be young. 
<br /><br />If you're a girl and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; 
<br /><br />If you're one of the few GUYS with enough balls to repost and you would never make your girl feel like this, repost as &quot;you're perfect
