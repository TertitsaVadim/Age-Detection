All of the formerly talked about affiliate advertising types (i.e. PPS, PPL, and PPC) drop below the single-tier classification.<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Two Tier - In two-tier affiliate advertising and marketing applications, the affiliates usually are not only paid out for your direct visitors or revenue that he provides for the merchant's site, but additionally on every targeted traffic or sales referred by other affiliates who joined as sub-affiliate in the over affiliate marketer.<br /><br />C) Multi Tier - Multi-tier affiliate advertising works the identical way, though the affiliate will get extra commission for a lot more number of levels of affiliates in various tiers inside the affiliate network.<br /><br />D) Residual Revenue Affiliate Marketing - Within this kind, aside from the affiliate obtaining paid out for each customer he has referred for the merchant's web site, the affiliate can also be paid out every time the consumer he has referred goes again to the merchant's web site and purchases yet another product.
