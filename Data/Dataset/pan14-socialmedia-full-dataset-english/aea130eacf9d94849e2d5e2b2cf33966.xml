<br /><br />Girl: I really like you. And I... I think I'm falling in love with you.
<br /><br />Boy: Ok...
<br /><br />Girl: What do you mean &quot;ok&quot;?
<br /><br />Boy: I don't like you like that...
<br /><br />Girl: Why not?
<br /><br />Boy: I can't tell you... maybe another time...
<br /><br />From then on, the girl kept asking the boy &quot;Why not?&quot; whenever she saw him, and he kept answering the same answer of &quot;I'll tell you later.&quot; Finally the girl got fed up.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm tired of this! Tell me why you don't like me!
<br /><br />Boy: Do you really wanna know why?
<br /><br />Girl: Yes!
<br /><br />Boy: It's because you're ugly as fuck! What's the point of going out with someone when they're not pretty?!
<br /><br />Girl: But... I...
<br /><br />Boy: Just shut up and leave me alone!
<br /><br />The boy leaves and the girl is sitting there alone, crying her heart out. Then her cell phone rings.
<br /><br />Girl: Hello?
<br /><br />Mom: Sweetheart? I want you to go home, ok? I'll be home from work in a few hours.
<br /><br />Girl: Alright Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: I love you.
<br /><br />Girl: I love you too, Mom.
<br /><br />Mom: Bye Bye.
<br /><br />Girl: Bye
<br /><br />The girl heads home and once she got there, she went in the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror.
<br /><br />Girl: I'm not pretty enough...
<br /><br />She set to work, knowing fully well what she was going to do. 2 hours later, her Mom came home and heard the bath water running. She went upstairs to find the hallway flooded so she knocked on the door.
<br /><br />Mom: Honey? Are you alright?
<br /><br />She opened the door and was shocked at the site. The bath was overflowing onto the floor, and the water was tinted red. She walked over to see what was inside and screamed. There, her little girl was lying with cuts all over her face and wrists. Her Mom backed away and was going to run to call the police when something caught her eye. On the mirror, am I pretty enough now?
<br /><br />No one deserves to be told that by someone they love. If you find it messed up then forward this to everyone you know.
<br /><br />A person's appearance doesn't count. What counts is their heart inside of them and their personality. No one wants to be told they're not good enough...

<br /><br />over and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love
<br /><br />for the first time.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
<br /><br />sex.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer,
<br /><br />with his head down.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *

<br />but the blood on the floor,
<br />and the knife in her hand.
<br />I try to scream for help,
<br />but nothing seems to come out.
<br />I go over to her,
<br />and hold her in my arms,
<br />crying.
<br />I look at her,
<br />and her lifeless eyes are staring back,
<br />seeming so peaceful,
<br />as if this is what she truly wanted.
<br />I start yelling,
<br />why did she do this.
<br />The pain she has had is overwhelming me,
<br />powerful in my heart,
<br />in my soul.
<br />And I sit here wondering,
<br />what made her do this,
<br />why did she have to leave my life.
<br />As I lay her back down,
<br />and close her eyes,
<br />I realize,
<br />that my best friend is gone,
<br />but is still living in my heart,
<br />for now I know how she felt.
<br />And her feelings take over me,
<br />as I pick up the knife,
<br />and end my life; falling beside her.
<br />I see her,
<br />and we're together again,
<br />finally living in a world of serenity.
<br />I hug her,
<br />and for once she looks happy.
<br />And we start walking hand-in-hand,
<br />just me,
<br />and my best friend.

<br /><br />(This was written by a guy)
<br /><br />Don't break this; it's so sweet!
<br /><br />1. They will always smell good even if it's just shampoo.
<br /><br />2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder.
<br /><br />3. How cute they look when they sleep.
<br /><br />4. The ease in which they fit into our arms.
<br /><br />5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world.
<br /><br />6. How cute they are when they eat.
<br /><br />7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it makes it all worth while.
<br /><br />8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside.
<br /><br />9. The way they look good no matter what they wear.
<br /><br />10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she's the most beautiful girl on this earth.
<br /><br />11. How cute they are when they argue.
<br /><br />12. The way her hand always finds yours.
<br /><br />13. The way they smile.
<br /><br />14. The way you feel when you see their name on the your cell after you just had a big fight.
<br /><br />15. The way she says &quot;lets not fight anymore&quot; - even though you know that an hour later....
<br /><br />16. The way that they kiss after you have had a fight.
<br /><br />17. The way they kiss you when you say &quot;I love you&quot;.
<br /><br />18. Actually...Just the way they kiss you...
<br /><br />19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry.
<br /><br />20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly.
<br /><br />21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt.
<br /><br />22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt (even though we don't admit it).
<br /><br />23. The way they say &quot;I miss you&quot;.
<br /><br />24. The way you miss them.
<br /><br />25. The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore...
<br /><br />Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them it matters not. Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, no paper would do it justice. It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart.
<br /><br />A feeling.
<br /><br />Only felt.
<br /><br />This chain started in 2002.
<br /><br />It is a love chain letter.
<br /><br />In an hour you are supposed to repost this.
<br /><br />Once you read this letter, you must IMMEDIATELY (meaning within the hour)
<br />post it with the title &quot;why do boys fall in love with girls? &quot;
<br />After you send it, make a wish and it will come true
<br /><br />even if you are a boy and

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...
