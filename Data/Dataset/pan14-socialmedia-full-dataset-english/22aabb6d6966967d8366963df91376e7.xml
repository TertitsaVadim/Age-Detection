<br />Older Lady: Is there a problem, Officer?
<br />Officer: Ma'am, you were speeding.
<br />Older Lady: Oh, I see.
<br />Officer: Can I see your license please?
<br />Older Lady: I'd give it to you but I don't have one.
<br />Officer: Don't have one?
<br />Older Lady: Lost it, 4 years ago for drunk driving.
<br />Officer: I see...Can I see your vehicle registration papers please.
<br />Older Lady: I can't do that.
<br />Officer: Why not?
<br />Older Lady: I stole this car.
<br />Officer: Stole it?
<br />Older Lady: Yes, and I killed and hacked up the owner.
<br />Officer: You what?
<br />Older Lady: His body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to
<br />see.
<br />The Officer looks at the woman and slowly backs away to his car and calls
<br />for back up. Within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. 
<br />A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.
<br />Officer 2: Ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please! 
<br />The older lady steps out of her vehicle.
<br />Older Lady: Is there a problem sir?
<br />Officer 2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner.
<br />Older Lady: Murdered the owner?
<br />Officer 2: Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car.
<br />The older lady opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.
<br />Officer 2: Is this your car, ma'am?
<br />Older Lady: Yes, here are the registration papers. The officer is quite stunned.
<br />Officer 2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license.
<br />The older lady digs into her handbag and pulls out a clutch purse and hands it to
<br />the officer.
<br />The officer examines the license. 
<br />He looks quite puzzled.
<br />Officer 2: Thank you ma'am, one of my officers told me you didn't have a
<br />license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner.
<br />Older Lady: Bet the liar told you I was speeding, too.
<br /><br />MORAL:
<br />Don't Mess With Little Old Ladies

<br />I heard you shout my name
<br />In this life I was to blame (Pre)
<br />As far as I can tell it is
<br />Another story, another bliss
<br /><br />Holding out my heart to silence
<br />I could feel you calling (verse 1)
<br />And I know that it was I
<br />The one who was falling
<br /><br />If I told you I was sorry
<br />Would you believe it was true (chorus x 2)
<br />Would you see me in some sick glory
<br />Or think you could see through
<br /><br />The very light in which I hold you
<br />Has always been so white (verse 2)
<br />Now I know there must be darkness
<br />As I hold you tight
<br /><br />(repeat Chorus x 2)
<br />(pre)
<br /><br />So what would you do?...

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...
