It means the same no matter what language you use It is what makes the world go round, or so they say. Love brings a smile to the face of many, tears to the eyes of many more. It is invisible to some, yet so easy to see. It can bridge and ocean, yet be hard to find Love makes people blind, yet fills ones eyes with beauty Love is something we should all be thankfull for. Long Live Love! Love is all things amazing It is sources of emotion That pin prick our realities Transforming our spirits minds souls It is as great as it is small As hidden as it seen Broad in its context yet defined individually Love is the unique expression that evolves Us from being beasts of burden to a celestial humanity Angelic existence which bestows us all gifts of the heart Beyond all things love can be singular, plural and universal And sometimes nothing at all. Yet Overall Love is something That is everything Touched given and received To all human Beings At least once or twice Along our journey Through this err of predictability That our Mortal life. Love.....you can’t touch it..... But you can give it.... You can’t hold it..but you can understand it You can’t smell it, or taste it...but you want it Love...so sweet...so comforting... So desired....so beautiful....a gift from God.... Love, a part of you.... shared..a part of you.. given Love, the kiss from an angel....the hug of passion The hope for tomorrow…..the beauty of today Love made for you and I, a feeling of warmth A feeling of being needed, wanted and cared for Love, a reason to go on living...a reason for trying Love, the reason...we are here...to see the beauty... In a man and a woman…..in love Love...an obtainable ecstasy One which each living soul strives to achieve Two souls combine as one Sharing emotions, dreams, and desires Love is an entity The grandeur of prayers Love is in the eyes of a child Embracing each new day as a miracle Our hearts crave the intensity Souls feed off the necessity Love creates a bond Unbreakable through time Fulfilling passions of the wildest imagination Reaching out to another in trust The fulfillment in the softest of touch Love is given…Love is received… The most amazing power to enrich… or deceive Love is that which comes from deep within once released it blossoms as a fragile flower nurtured then the bloom endures but neglected it does go to seed left unpollenated it turns to dust becoming nothing more than soil undisturbed .

<br />When all is said and done, you are.
<br />And I, well I suppose I am almost
<br />as honorable as you…..almost.
<br />If we weren’t, you would be on
<br />the next plane here and I would do
<br />nothing to dissuade you from
<br />coming to me, staying with me,
<br />loving me in the complete expression
<br />of what we both secretly know we feel.
<br /><br />But….you can’t because you are
<br />honorable and I would want you to be
<br />no other way, for it is part of the man
<br />I admire and respect so much, honor.
<br />Even if it should be misplaced and
<br />completely unappreciated, it is noble
<br />and priceless in my eyes… the true you.
<br />The you that will deny and hurt herself
<br />rather than those who depend on her.
<br />And I could not come to you…no, not
<br />with these chains or thoughts of any other,
<br />nor could I cause selfish pain to other hearts.
<br /><br />So here we are… drowning every day
<br />in the sea of our damned honor;
<br />longing to look into each others’ eyes
<br />aching to touch…. just once, even if
<br />it had to stop at a brief platonic hug.
<br />I’ll send you my thoughts, my warmth.
<br />You’ll bask in them and feel alive again.
<br />You will ache to hold, to protect me
<br />to shelter me from fear and heartaches;
<br />while we honorably love each other
<br />from a very great distance in miles
<br />but with no aloofness in our hearts.

<br /><br />She gave him a portrait of a woman
<br />world of pleasure and pain in her eyes
<br />Her heart unspoiled and tender
<br />no need to wear a disguise
<br /><br />Each day he glanced at the portrait
<br />but the person he could never see
<br />Ignoring the passion and pain in her eyes
<br />and the woman she could be
<br /><br />Days spent together becoming weeks
<br />and weeks soon evolving to years
<br />The pleasure and pain in the portrait’s eyes
<br />were veiled now by woman tears
<br /><br />She gave him a portrait of a woman
<br />but the portrait was all he would ever own
<br />The love and life deep within her eyes
<br />were shrouded and finally gone
<br /><br />She gave him a portrait of a woman
<br />too distant for his longing tangible touch
<br />Each day he gazed at that portrait
<br />desiring her beauty so much
<br /><br />He saw beneath the chilled apathy
<br />discovering beyond the numbed disguise
<br />a world of pleasure and pain
<br />revolving within her eyes
<br /><br />Thawing her chill with warm love words
<br />caressing her silent soul with piercing truth
<br />Until the world in her eyes opened to him
<br />and her love became the proof
<br /><br />She gave him a portrait of a woman
<br />too distant for his yearning tactile embrace
<br />but he found a whole world to possess
<br />in the beauty of the portrait’s face

<br />covered by jagged rocks of pain and despair.
<br />My journey was long, My Sweet Love
<br />until I found this home, this shelter in your arms.
<br />Your words reached into the core of my soul
<br />capturing, enclosing me in your love and devotion.
<br />Bathing away the grime of dark desolation
<br />in the shimmering, rushing waterfall of your ardor.
<br />Burning to ash hopelessness and apathy
<br />in the white-hot fire of your disturbing passion
<br />You won not my affection alone, but my admiration.
<br />How could I not love a man such as you?
<br />Never did I dare to entertain a hope of touching you.
<br />The only recourse, the well of my heart poetry
<br />poured out to you with wild abandonment to
<br />the longings and satisfactions your love awakened
<br />We adored from a distance, in heart and word
<br />Never, My Love, did I dare to imagine I would be
<br />wrapped in your arms, revel in your touch
<br />taste the sweetness and raw need of your lips.
<br />Never would I feel your hardness deep within
<br />nor give you the hot, rhythmic pleasure
<br />of my secret softness surrounding, embracing you
<br /><br />WE WILL STILL MEET IF YOU BELIEVE.

<br />Kneeling before the sun
<br />Stooped knees bent
<br />Heart pleading

<br />In the silence…
<br />I see your face,
<br />Through every tear
<br />A barren place
<br />You left a silhouette
<br />To keep me near
<br />Now I’m
<br />Breaking shaking
<br />Seeking sanctimony
<br />Where is time? to

<br />When pleading hearts
<br />Cry cashmere dew
<br />So dark is this hour
<br />Before the dawn
<br /><br />You walked away

<br />before you leave my life

<br /><br />&quot;We are beginning our final descent. The captain has asked that you please fasten your seatbelts &amp; return your tray to an upright and locked position.&quot;
<br /><br />She blinked rapidly and tried to regain her bearings. All around her began the cacophony of the flight crew preparing for landing. She looked at her tray, still locked in front of her. She had never taken it down. She had been too excited and so terribly nervous. When they passed out the meals she politely declined. Even after the flight attendant reminded her the flight was 10 hours - her nerves got the best of her. So, she had closed her eyes and tried to sleep her way through this seemingly stoppage of time.
<br /><br />So as the world busied itself around her, she thought about the dream again. It gave her a sense of comfort. There was no regret or worry just the simple feeling of &quot;knowing&quot; that it was right &amp; the direction was clear. She smiled to herself as she let the memories of the past months tumble through her mind like a bubbling brook.
<br /><br />They hadn't been looking for each other. Well, not specifically for each other. She supposed that they had both been looking for something, but what it was - she really didn't know. All she did know was that from the first time they spoke, there was something special about him. She couldn't pinpoint it exactly. There was so much about him that was amazing. The more they spoke, the more this connection between them grew. And even though they were thousands of miles apart, it seemed at times that they had known each other all their lives. Many times they had agreed they were separated by circumstance, but connected by something much more profound. Comfortable, was a word they often used when talking about how they felt with each other.
<br /><br />They shared things with each other that they didn't tell anyone else. When something or someone upset one, they both cried. When one received good news, they both celebrated. They shared everything from the highest highs to the lowest lows, but it was the little things, the everyday occurrences, that they both loved to share with each other the most. It connected them together in a way that few shared. Their hearts became one - beating in perfect rhythm.
<br /><br />And when, after months of exploration, she realized that she had fallen in love with him - there was no explosion of light or bells sounding in the distance. But better yet, a calm that surrounded her, a sense of knowing that this is why she had been brought to this place in her life - to be with him.
<br /><br />She smiled to herself as she recalled the twinkle in the laugh she had heard so many times on the telephone. It reached the deepest places inside her and lit them up brighter than any sun possibly could. Even now, when nothing more than a vivid memory, it made her quietly laugh to herself and she felt herself lighter just from the remembrance.
<br /><br />Her friends had thought she was crazy. Most of them had turned her back on her when she informed them of her decision to fly halfway across the world to spend time with him. But there were a few, those whose hearts belonged to others far away, that understood why she had to do this. But none of them could ever understand how deep their connection ran. It was beyond the realm of words, beyond any description she could offer. It was the first time in her life she could feel her soul.
<br /><br />So now, here she was - almost ten hours into a flight that had the power to break her heart or promise new beginnings. It was terrifying and exhilarating all at once and from the way the butterflies were bouncing inside her - she had no doubt that she was experiencing it all to the fullest extent. They had made no promises to each other, no expectations of forever - but inside she knew, this trip teetered on a new horizon for both of them.
<br /><br />After what seemed days instead of minutes, the plane finally set down on the runway. As they taxied in, she peered through the window at the foreign countryside around her. Fields of green dotted by cattle &amp; sheep mixed in with the urban hustle and bustle of the nearby city. She took it all in quietly, but even now, it felt like she'd been here before.
<br /><br />As the plane came to a stop, she unbuckled her seatbelt, but her feet wouldn't move. Her heart was pounding so hard in her ears. She was afraid if she stood, she might fall right back down in a dead faint. Questions tumbled through her mind, &quot;What if he doesn't like the way I look? What if we're suddenly shy around each other? What if this was the wrong thing to do?&quot; Round and round on the carousel of doubt she found herself twirling and before she even realized it, she was up and out of the plane and making her way through customs.
<br /><br />A long and tedious line, customs proved more nerve racking than the flight itself. Little by little the passengers moved through the long lines and one by one they disappeared through the gray doors at the end of the hallway. She knew he was out there - waiting. The thought made her close her eyes and take a deep breath to keep from falling. Finally, it was her turn. Yes, she was here on holiday. No, she had nothing to declare. &quot;Except unconditional love,&quot; she thought to herself and found the corners of her mouth turning upwards at the thought. With one swoop of his hand, the customs agent stamped her passport and motioned her through. The doors loomed ahead of her and she stopped for a moment, trying to comprehend what these next few steps meant.
<br /><br />She took a deep breath and pushed the doors open.
<br /><br />It was crowded in the airport. All around her private reunions were taking place. Mothers greeted daughters. Husbands kissed their wives. Hands were shaken and welcomes professed. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed with a life of their own as she shyly looked through the teeming crowds for any sign of the face that she saw each time she closed her eyes. She scanned the terminal but didn't spot anyone familiar. She felt the panic begin to rise up within her and she fought the instinct to turn and walk to the nearest desk for a flight home. But suddenly, she saw him - he was there - across the room standing quietly in a corner. His eyes focused intently on hers. She would know those eyes anywhere. Beautiful pools of color that she could lose herself in. Even at this distance, the effect they had was dizzying.
<br /><br />He began to walk toward her and she felt her eyes begin to well with tears. By the time he was standing in front of her, she was trembling and biting her lip trying to keep some composure. Their eyes had never left each other's as he crossed the busy terminal toward her. It was if time had suddenly stopped and they had become the only two people in the world. She had the sensation of people walking past, conversations being held, but they were far in the background now. The only thing that mattered was the two of them.
<br /><br />He did not speak, only smiled. But it was a smile that spoke ten thousand words. His eyes were wet with tears. He held out his hands and offered her a bouquet of wildflowers. She recognized them as the Kinds they had laughed about growing around their cottage. The one they would build on the seashore to spend their days together. When he held them out to her, she burst into laughter and tears at the same time and gently placed her hands on his. When their skin touched, it was as if all the electricity in the world had been funneled into this one spot. It shook her down to her core.
<br /><br />Suddenly, he took her in his arms and spun her around, both of them laughing into each other. Their embrace grew tighter until nothing separated them. It was then that their lips found each other and they succumbed to a kiss.
<br /><br />A kiss that had been written about for centuries, but had never been done poetic justice. A kiss that held the promise of all tomorrows and the fates of all the yesterdays.
<br /><br />A kiss that told the tale of two souls that rode on the backs of angels and made their way skyward past the trail of Icarus.
<br /><br />For all of us whose hearts belong to someone far away.

<br />Of five long winters! and again I hear
<br />These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
<br />With a soft inland murmur.Once again
<br />Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
<br />That on a wild secluded scene impress
<br />Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
<br />The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
<br />The day is come when I again repose
<br />Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
<br />These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
<br />Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
<br />Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
<br />'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
<br />These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
<br />Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
<br />Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
<br />Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
<br />With some uncertain notice, as might seem
<br />Of vagrant dwellers in the house less woods,
<br />Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
<br />The Hermit sits alone.
<br /><br />These beauteous forms,
<br />Through a long absence, have not been to me
<br />As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:
<br />But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
<br />Of towns and cities, I have owed to them
<br />In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
<br />Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
<br />And passing even into my purer mind,
<br />With tranquil restoration: -- feelings too
<br />Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,
<br />As have no slight or trivial influence
<br />On that best portion of a good man's life,
<br />His little, nameless, unremembered, acts
<br />Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
<br />To them I may have owed another gift,
<br />Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
<br />In which the burthen of the mystery,
<br />In which the heavy and the weary weight
<br />Of all this unintelligible world,
<br />Is lightened: -- that serene and blessed mood,
<br />In which the affections gently lead us on, -- 
<br />Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
<br />And even the motion of our human blood
<br />Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
<br />In body, and become a living soul:
<br />While with an eye made quiet by the power
<br />Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
<br />We see into the life of things.
<br /><br />If this
<br />Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft -- 
<br />In darkness and amid the many shapes
<br />Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir
<br />Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,
<br />Have hung upon the beatings of my heart -- 
<br />How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
<br />O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro' the woods,
<br />How often has my spirit turned to thee!
<br />And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,
<br />With many recognitions dim and faint,
<br />And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
<br />The picture of the mind revives again:
<br />While here I stand, not only with the sense
<br />Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts
<br />That in this moment there is life and food
<br />For future years. And so I dare to hope,
<br />Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
<br />I came among these hills; when like a roe
<br />I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides
<br />Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
<br />Wherever nature led: more like a man
<br />Flying from something that he dreads, than one
<br />Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
<br />(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,
<br />And their glad animal movements all gone by)
<br />To me was all in all. -- I cannot paint
<br />What then I was. The sounding cataract
<br />Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,
<br />The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
<br />Their colours and their forms, were then to me
<br />An appetite; a feeling and a love,
<br />That had no need of a remoter charm,
<br />By thought supplied, nor any interest
<br />Unborrowed from the eye. -- That time is past,
<br />And all its aching joys are now no more,
<br />And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
<br />Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts
<br />Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,
<br />Abundant recompense. For I have learned
<br />To look on nature, not as in the hour
<br />Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes
<br />The still, sad music of humanity,
<br />Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
<br />To chasten and subdue. And I have felt
<br />A presence that disturbs me with the joy
<br />Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime
<br />Of something far more deeply inter fused,
<br />Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
<br />And the round ocean and the living air,
<br />And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;
<br />A motion and a spirit, that impels
<br />All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
<br />And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
<br />A lover of the meadows and the woods,
<br />And mountains; and of all that we behold
<br />From this green earth; of all the mighty world
<br />Of eye, and ear,both what they half create,
<br />And what perceive; well pleased to recognize
<br />In nature and the language of the sense,
<br />The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,
<br />The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul
<br />Of all my moral being.
<br /><br />Nor perchance,
<br />If I were not thus taught, should I the more
<br />Suffer my genial spirits to decay:
<br />For thou art with me here upon the banks
<br />Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,
<br />My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch
<br />The language of my former heart, and read
<br />My former pleasures in the shooting lights
<br />Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while
<br />May I behold in thee what I was once,
<br />My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,
<br />Knowing that Nature never did betray
<br />The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,
<br />Through all the years of this our life, to lead
<br />From joy to joy: for she can so inform
<br />The mind that is within us, so impress
<br />With quietness and beauty, and so feed
<br />With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
<br />Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
<br />Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
<br />The dreary intercourse of daily life,
<br />Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb
<br />Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
<br />Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
<br />Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;
<br />And let the misty mountain-winds be free
<br />To blow against thee: and, in after years,
<br />When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
<br />Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind
<br />Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
<br />Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
<br />For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,
<br />If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
<br />Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts
<br />Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
<br />And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance -- 
<br />If I should be where I no more can hear
<br />Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams
<br />Of past existence -- wilt thou then forget
<br />That on the banks of this delightful stream
<br />We stood together; and that I, so long
<br />A worshiper of Nature, hither came
<br />Unwearied in that service: rather say
<br />With warmer love -- oh! with far deeper zeal
<br />Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
<br />That after many wanderings, many years
<br />Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,
<br />And this green pastoral landscape, were to me
<br />More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!

<br /><br />Is this how the story goes?
<br />Does the tale have a happy end?
<br />I'm losing all sense and hope,
<br />Fighting a battle in which I can't contend...
<br /><br />I close my eyes and run away
<br />To a forbidden and forsaken land,
<br />Where only in fantasies,
<br />With you, can I take a stand...
<br /><br />No need to fight,
<br />No need to run...
<br />Our fairy tale has just begun.
<br /><br />Enchanted dreams
<br />Become realities,
<br />When we're together - two in one.
<br /><br />I come into your world,
<br />Through a door locked, without a key...
<br />I look into your eyes...
<br />We both know what I see.
<br /><br />A vision of us - hand in hand -
<br />In a future not quite far...
<br />Two hearts beating in coalition,
<br />Their love carried on the same bright star.
<br /><br />No need to fight,
<br />No need to run...
<br />Our fairy tale has just begun.
<br /><br />Enchanted dreams
<br />Become realities,
<br />When we're together - two in one.
<br /><br />When will we be with one another?
<br />So we can devote all our love to each other.

<br />within a dream inside a dream
<br />you came to me
<br />so sweetly and serene.
<br /><br />From out of mind shadows
<br />carefully I stepped toward you
<br />glowing with hope
<br />that my dream had come true.
<br /><br />In rising before you
<br />hesitantly I took your hand
<br />yet right you felt
<br />like spring sun warming winter land.
<br /><br />Quickly I discovered
<br />nearly all of my adult life
<br />I'd been sleeping
<br />'til awakened by you that night.
