<br /><br />3G spectrum auction remains a 1Q10 event; spectrum allotment by Aug-10
<br /><br />* What’s new – eGoM decides to auction four 3G-spectrum slots in Jan-10, simultaneous spectrum allotment by Aug-10: Press reports quoting the Indian Telecom Minister, Mr. A. Raja, state that post their scheduled meeting on 3G spectrum auction, the Empowered Group of Ministers (eGoM) have concluded [1] To auction four slots of 3G spectrum as per original schedule i.e. on January 14, 2010, [2] Vacation of 3G spectrum (by defence forces) and subsequent simultaneous spectrum allotment to the four winners by August 2010.
<br /><br />* Adherence to 1Q10 auction timeline is not surprising: The eGoM decision appears to be in line with the key takeaway from our recent meeting with channel checks on this issue (see note titled 2G, 3G Regulations – Takeaways from meetings with channel checks, dated December 11, 2009) that ‘Government finances’ is the key driver for ensuring the 3G spectrum auction is completed in 1Q10 itself and the Notice Inviting Applications (NIA), previously scheduled to be issued on 08-Dec-09, will be issued by 25-Dec-09.
<br /><br />* What next – await clarity on available slots, revised timetable: Press reports suggest that 4 slots of 3G spectrum excluding one slot reserved for Government incumbents (BSNL/MTNL) will be auctioned across all service areas; however, the NIA (a legally binding document) will contain the final quantum of 3G spectrum slots to be auctioned in
<br />each service area. In our view, there is a high probability that the current auction timetable (Exhibit 3) would be pushed back by 2-3 weeks to account for the delay in issuance of the NIA.
<br /><br />* Implications: In our view, [1] Adherence to 1Q10 timeline is beneficial for the sector as not only will the ‘risk of overpaying for 3G spectrum’ be behind us, but the potential impact on the financials of majority of winning telcos would lower the propensity to engage in prolonged price wars. [2] If four 3G spectrum slots are indeed available for auction across all service areas, together with simultaneous allotment of airwaves, the ‘clearing price’ for securing 3G spectrum will be relatively lower, [3] As competition for revenue market share intensifies and price wars take toll on telcos’ financials, BRTI (Buy, TP Rs360) is best positioned to fund its 3G spectrum bids and use 3G offerings as an opportunity to ‘differentiate’ from a majority of its peers.
<br /><br />* No change in our 3G/BWA outlay assumptions for coverage stocks: Based on the 3G/BWA spectrum slots available for auction as per the Revised Information Memorandum (IM), we currently peg the clearing price of [1] one 2x5MHz slot of nationwide (ex. Rajasthan, North East) 3G spectrum at Rs63 bn, [2] one 20 MHz slot of nationwide BWA spectrum at Rs26.4 bn. Our 3G/BWA spectrum outlay assumption for coverage telcos remains unchanged – Rs60 bn (~Rwww./share) for BRTI, Rs40 bn (~Rwww./share) for IDEA, Rwww..8 bn (~Rs20/share) for MTNL and Rwww..7 bn (~Rs69/share) for TCOM.

<br /><br />Buy only on a move above 271 with a stop loss below 267 for an intra-day target of 277.
<br /><br /><strong>Nifty - Last Leg Of The Current Phase</strong>
<br /><br />The Nifty gained 33 points over the day to close at 5231. With
<br />the momentum back in place the markets rallied further
<br />yesterday and tested the levels of 17500/5250. To an extent the
<br />Indian markets underperformed the rest of Asia by closing with
<br />minor gains while most other indices registered gains of 1-2.5%.
<br />The same is understandable as the Nifty witnessed a
<br />phenomenal rally on Tuesday and therefore some cool-off was
<br />likely, which was seen in the second half yesterday. The set-up
<br />continues to be positive as the technical indicators are yet to see
<br />any divergence. Even the oscillators are not yet abnormally
<br />overbought and hence some more upside can be expected. The
<br />“U” shaped pattern on the indices should get completed with the
<br />indices hitting the resistance zone of 17700-17800/5270-5300
<br />anytime in the next few days. Once done we believe the markets
<br />should get into pullback mode and the extent of the same would
<br />be known later. For the day, support seen at 5223. Overall, the
<br />indices are in the last leg of the upmove that began on the
<br />Budget day with upside capped to the Jan ’10 highs.

<br />Shooting Star
<br />Nifty has touched another milestone - 6200 level in early trade on Monday but could not able to hold the same level after initial couple of hours of trade. It traded in a positive terrain but slowly wiped out nearly 75% of gains in the second half of trade and closed with marginal gains. Moreover, it has formed a Shooting Star pattern, which is a sign of exhaustion and hence we may see some profit taking in the near future. However for confirmation one should look for a break below 6144 on closing basis.
<br />BSE Oil &amp; Gas
<br />BSE Oil &amp; Gas sector is forming a bullish pattern on hourly chart and is also standing at the support of 50-hourly simple moving average.

<br />Nifty ended with moderate losses of 50 odd points on weekly basis, after showing a smart rally for five consecutive weeks.

<br /><br />Shooting Star – a sign of caution
<br />The sell-off across all sectors brought the index down to settle below 6100 after hitting a weekly high of 6284.10. Moreover, on weekly degree Nifty has formed a Shooting Star candlestick pattern with a small real body at the lower end of the range and a long upper shadow. Such Shooting Stars sends a warning signal as bulls fail to gain control and an impending correction may be near. However, unless the trend of 21-daily exponential moving average changes or market gives a lower top lower bottom signal one should not jump the guns and start going short.
<br />BSE Metal
<br />BSE Metal seems to be in a short term correction mode, due to which it has a high probability to correct upto 17050 level. Moreover, today’s sell signal in daily MACD is also a sign of caution for the short term buyers.

<br /><br /><strong>Bullish Hammer</strong>
<br />Following the previous weeks' down move, Nifty opened on a softer note and traded below the 6000 mark in the morning session. It took support at the 5985 mark and reversed the losses for the day to close near the highs of the day. In the process it has made a 'Bullish Hammer' candlestick pattern on the daily chart, which makes the low of 5985 an important support level. So we still stick to our bullish view for the target of 6500.
<br /><br /><strong>BSE Bankex</strong>
<br />BSE Bankex seems to have taken support at the lower Bollinger band with the formation of a Bullish Hammer and hence in the short term this index can heighten upto 14600 level.

Moreover, it closed the volatile session with a loss of 20 odd points. Moreover, the slant of 100-hsma for the index in also in the falling mode, which means that the short-term trend is still down and the index is bound to see lower targets in the near future.

<br />Three times lucky
<br />Nifty closed below the 6000 level - a psychologically important level, on expiry day for the month of October 2010, especially after extremely volatile trade in last one hour of trade. However, today again Nifty managed to find support near 5966 level and this has happened for the third time in past few sessions - &quot;three times lucky&quot;. Moreover, number three plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical analysis and hence the level of 5966 should be looked as a key pivot in the coming sessions. If Nifty manages to hold this level, then this consolidation phase will provide the base to go pass the previous high of 6357. On the contrary, if 5966 get violated on closing basis then the slide of Nifty will continue upto 5850-5800 levels.
<br />BSE Oil &amp; Gas
<br />BSE Oil &amp; Gas index is currently resting at the support of 20-DSMA and overall trend is still up as the higher top higher bottom formation is still intact. So a daily positive close in this index will back the confidence of the bulls and we may see this index scaling fresh highs in the near future.

<br />Bullish gap intact
<br />Nifty opened with a gap up once again on Thursday and rallied steadily for the remainder of the day to register an all-time high closing for the index. Nifty has now closed above the 6300 mark is only a few points off from the all-time intraday high of 6357. The momentum oscillators are in bullish territory, the daily MACD has also triggered a buy crossover. Market wide breadth was in favor of advances. Nifty is trading in a rising trend channel and unless that channel is intact one can expect Nifty to test our medium term bias.
<br />BSE Auto
<br />The index has gone past the previous swing high indicating that the bullish momentum is still strong and one can look for targets in range of 10550-10700.
