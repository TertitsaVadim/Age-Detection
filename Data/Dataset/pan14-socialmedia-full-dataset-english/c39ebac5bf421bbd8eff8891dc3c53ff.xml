<br /><br />Girl: ok (begins to walk away) 
<br /><br />[They both go back home. And erika begins to read the letter he gave her] 
<br /><br />It says..... 
<br /><br />Erika, 
<br /><br />You probably already know that i'm leaving, i knew this would be better if i wrote a letter explaining tha truth about how much i care about you. The truth is, is that i never loved you, i hated you so much, you are my bitch and dont you ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, and be around you. You really have no clue how much i hate you. Now that im leaving i thought you should know that i hate you bitch, you never did the right thing, and you were never there. I didnt think i could hate someone as much as i hate you. And i never want to see you, for the rest of my life, i will never miss kissing you like before, i never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and thats a promise. You never had my love, and i want you to remember that. Bitch, you keep this letter because this may be the last thing you have from me. I hate you so much. i will not talk to you soon bitch. 
<br />Goodbye. 
<br />- Kyle 
<br />[ erika begins to cry, she throws the paper in the garbage &amp; crys for hours ] 
<br /><br />....A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels so lonely.... Then she gets a phone call.... 
<br /><br />Friend: how are you feeling? 
<br /><br />Girl: i just cant believe this happend i thought he loved me. 
<br /><br />Friend: oh, about that. Kyle left me a msg. A few days ago. He told me to tell you to look in your jacket pocket or something... 
<br /><br />Girl: ummm ok 
<br /><br />[She finds a piece of paper in the jacket, It says...] 
<br /><br />Baby i hope you find this before you read my letter. I knew your dad might read it, so i switched a few words... 
<br /><br />Hate = Love 
<br /><br />Never = Always 
<br /><br />Bitch = Baby 
<br /><br />Will not= will 
<br /><br />........ I hope you didnt take that seriously because i love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats why i wanted you to run away with me... 
<br /><br />-Kyle] 
<br /><br />Girl: omg its a letter, Kyle does love me!!, he must of slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. I cant believe how stupid I am!! 
<br /><br />Friend: lol ok but i got to go... Call me later 
<br /><br />Girl: *happy*ok bye, i'll be at home waiting for my baby to call me !!

<br /><br />and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a 
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that 
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love 
<br /><br />for the first time. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex 
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get 
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and 
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. 
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and 
<br /><br />sex. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many 
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family 
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he 
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents 
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm 
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot; 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table 
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly 
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, 
<br /><br />with his head down. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the 
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the 
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot; 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your 
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot; 
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * 
<br /><br />If you DON'T re-post this in 1 minute you will 
<br /><br />have bad sex for life!!! - not likely ;]

Now, this is freaky...DO NOT CHEAT (You'll will kick yourself later) I was a little sceptical trying this, but if you follow the instructions to the &quot;t&quot; you'll be surprised!!!! 
<br /><br />All of my answers were accurate. We'll see tomorrow if the wish comes true. I'll let you know. Take 3 minutes and try this...it will freak you out! The person who sent it to me said her wish came true 10 minutes after they read the mail. BUT NO CHEATING! This game has a funny/spooky outcome. 
<br /><br />Don't read ahead...just do it in order! It takes about three minutes...it's worth a try 
<br /><br />First..get a pen and paper. When you actually choose names, make sure it's people you actually know and go with your first instinct. 
<br /><br />Scroll down one line at a time...and don't read ahead or you'll ruin it! 
<br /><br />1. First, write the numbers 1 through 11 in a column. 
<br /><br />2. Then, beside numbers 1 and 2, write down any two numbers you want. 
<br /><br />3. Beside the 3 and 7, write down the names of members of the opposite sex. 
<br /><br />NO LOOKING AHEAD...OR IT WON&quot;T TURN OUT RIGHT! 
<br /><br />4. Write anyone's name (like friends or family....) in the 4th, 5th,and 6th spots. 
<br /><br />5. Write down four song titles in 8,9,10, and 11. 
<br /><br />GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT PEOPLE!!!! 
<br /><br />6. Finally, make a wish. 
<br /><br />And now the key for the game..... 
<br /><br />1. You must tell (the number in space 2) people about this game. 
<br /><br />2. The person in space 3 is the one that you love. 
<br /><br />3. The person in 7 is one you like but can't work out. 
<br /><br />4. You care most about the person you put in 4 
<br /><br />5. The person you name in number 5 is the one who knows you very well. 
<br /><br />6. The person you name in 6 is your lucky star. 
<br /><br />7. The song in 8 is the song that matches with the person in number 3. 
<br /><br />8. The title in 9 is the song for the person in 7. 
<br /><br />9. The tenth space is the song that tells you most about YOUR mind. 
<br /><br />10. and 11 is the song telling you how you feel about life 
<br /><br />NOW...put this on ur syt within the hour you read this...IF you do..your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the opposite

<br />im not sure what i have been, but all i new is when he left me my whole world feel apart, 
<br />when someone you care about and spent alot of time with suddenly leaves you, of course your going to hurt, and it will drive you mad when friends and family tell you, you will get over him, but at the point you wont and you carnt imagine ever loving some like that again, but sooner or later you start to realise that maybe things arnt going so bad, and maybe you will be fine without him, the worst thing is is when you find out he has a girlfriend or if your a boy a boyfriend, all your feelings you have felt for him that you though went away suddenly start to appear and the sleep less night all come back. 
<br /><br />You shoud never say all boys are the same, i know that, but how can you not say it when every single boy you have come across hurts you, its only naturally to say there all the same, im not saying girls are completly harmless and dont break people hearts because they do, everyone hurts someone, it just the way life goes as sad as it is. 
<br /><br />I just dont understand why so many people are out there to hurt someone. 
<br />why get involved with someone that you know you wont love? 
<br /><br />The hardest thing is to get other someone you love, and start a relationship with some one else, you have to open up to them in the way you opened up to your ex, and i dont know about you but the though of that frightens me, i dont want to get hurt by someone who makes you believe they care about you, just like before. 
<br /><br />I Just want people to read this and understand that it isnt fair to mess people around and play with there feelings, go with someone you like, dont just go with them because there easy or been around acouple of times, because it takes alot for a person to open up to another person, so dont ruin it and break there heart 
<br /><br />Remeber what it felt like for you.. x

<br /><br />Real friends: will look at you stumbling all over the place and say “bitch drink the rest of that you know we don’t waste shit.” 
<br />Fake friends: will talk shit to the person who talks shit about you 
<br /><br />Real friends: will knock them the fuck out 
<br /><br />Fake friends: will read this. 
<br /><br />Real friends: will steal this 
<br /><br />A friend is like a flower a rose to be exact, 
<br /><br />Or maybe like a brand new gate that never comes unlocked 
<br /><br />A friend is like an owl, both beautiful and wise 
<br /><br />Or perhaps a friends is like a ghost, who never dies. 
<br /><br />A friend is like a heart that goes strong until the end. 
<br /><br />Where would we be in this world if we didn’t have a friend 
<br /><br />Make new friends but keep the old one is sliver and the other gold! 
<br /><br />It takes more than caring to be a real friend; the nature of friendship; requires a blend of warmest compassion and love deep and true to reach and to comfort the way that you do. 
<br /><br />Because I can see that your kind of friendship is priceless to me.
