<br /><br />As The Tyler Group guides you to shopping malls and centers in Barcelona.
<br />Las Arenas shopping centre Barcelona.
<br />Centro comercial Las Arenas de Barcelona. Spectacular new shopping mall that opened in 2011 in a former Barcelona bull fighting ring and which welcomed 10 million visitors in its first year of operation. Las Arenas is close to Montjuic hill with attractions like the MNAC musuem and the Magic Fountain. It is also very convenient for shopping if you attending events at the Fira Montjuic Exhibition centre. Las Arenas has brand name shops, restaurants and is home to the Barcelona Museu del Rock. Don’t miss a stroll on the skywalk terrace on the roof with restaurants and panoramic views of Montjuic hill and Barcelona. Crowning the building is a domed theatre, concert and event space called “Cúpula de las Arenas.”
<br />El Centre de la Vila.
<br />Small shopping centre in Vila Olimpica in Sant Marti district of Barcelona. Popular due to the Yelmo Icaria VO cinemas, a well-stocked supermarket with some foreign food items, and a few good restaurants that can be enjoyed before watching a movie. Try El Burro Chilango who make authentic Mexican tacos al pastor and other dishes.
<br />El Corte Inglés Barcelona stores.
<br />El Corte Ingles is the biggest chain of department stores in Barcelona and Spain. They have multiple stores in all major Spanish cities and in various locations in Barcelona. The biggest Corte Inglés in Barcelona is the huge bomb shelter style building on Plaza Catalunya. Corte Inglés stores are open Monday to Saturday from 10.00 to 22.00. The Corte Inglés on Plaza Catalunya has an excellent if a bit expensive supermarket in the basement which is open until 22.00 every night, which is later than most supermarkets. They also have a good delicatessen shop with imported foods from around the world. El Corte Inglés means “the English cut” as in tailoring – not “the English court” as many think.
<br />Centro Comercial Gran Via 2.
<br />Shopping mall in Barcelona is a big shopping centre in Barcelona with all the major brand name shops. Gran Via 2 is the only the shopping centre in the southern area and Montjuic area of Barcelona. It is conveniently located on the Gran Via street of Barcelona past Plaza Espanya and close to theBarcelona FIRA trade fair pavilion and IKEA L’hospitalet, one of the two IKEAS stores in Barcelona. The location is 10 minutes from the Barcelona El Prat airport and GRAN VÍA 2 shopping mail is very well connected with the Barcelona’s main southern traffic entry and exit roads.
<br />The Maremagnum shopping mall.
<br />Open all week including Sundays. Maremagnum is a modern shopping mall with many brand names shops, restaurants and bars. It is located at the bottom end of Las Ramblas walking street in the Port Vell harbour of Barcelona. Previously Maremagnum had many pubs and bars on the top floor, but from 2012 the roof floor has reinvented itself on gourment food and has re-opened with a nice open-air terrace surrounded by a selection of twenty new gourmet restaurants that offer good quality dining with harbour and all the city and harbour views. So a nice place for lunch or dinner now. Nearby attractions of Maremagnum include the Barcelona Aquarium, the 3D IMAX cinemaand the Barcelona harbour tours. Maremagnum shopping mall is walking distance of Barceloneta, which also has many restaurants and bars and a beach.

<br />Some hotels in Barcelona are true monuments; we find luxurious old palaces as well as buildings of the latest avant-garde architecture. We have selected for you some of the most emblematic and most comfortable hotels:
<br />Monument of Luís Doménech i Montaner “modernist and luxurious”
<br />Some visit this building just as a sight, others use it as a scenery for movies such as Woody Allen for “Vicky Cristina Barcelona”. And then there are the ones who have the privilege to accommodate themselves here during their stay at Barcelona. The hotel is located at the heart of the city at Paseo de Gracia, and is one of the most emblematic buildings of Modernism in Barcelona. It was built in 1908 by the famous architect “Luís Doménech i Montaner”, and both the facade and the interiors boast the elegance and extravagance of the period.

<br /><br />AMG presents the new Private Lounge in Affalterbach, offering AMG owners and potential customers 5,651 square feet of ideal ambience for conversation and communication. The lounge was built as a tool designed to foster customer relations; the newly constructed building is a meeting-place for the growing, worldwide AMG Community. Both the architecture and atmosphere are characterized by style, individuality and exclusivity.
<br /><br />Ola Källenius, Chairman of Mercedes-AMG GmbH: “The new AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach is an exclusively and unusually designed meeting-point in which to spend time. We see it as a second living-room for our customers. We want the AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach to provide the perfect setting for the most exciting day of the year – for example when our customers take possession of their new AMG-Mercedes here in Affalterbach.”
<br /><br />Mario Spitzner, head of Branding &amp; Marketing at Mercedes-AMG GmbH: “The virtual AMG Private Lounge was already launched for our American customers in 2006. When the AMG Private Lounge Community was established for the German-speaking markets at the end of 2009, this was the starting-point for the internationalization of the official AMG Brand Community. Owners of an AMG-Mercedes are extremely welcome to share their passion for the brand with other AMG enthusiasts. Inside knowledge, direct contact with Mercedes-AMG, exclusive events and various ways of exchanging views on an online forum create an emotionally appealing environment dedicated to the AMG brand. At present more than 15,000 members worldwide are accredited for the AMG Private Lounge Community. With the opening of the AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach, it now also takes on physical form for our customers. As a place for communication in a unique atmosphere, and at the same time a further advance in the interests of first-class customer care at our headquarters in Affalterbach.”
<br /><br />The new multi-storey building is directly reachable from the AMG showroom via an outside staircase, and impresses with its clear architectural lines. In the entrance the visitor is treated to a photographic display of the legendary 300 SEL 6.8 AMG racing touring car on the famous “Eau Rouge” in Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium). This work of art consists of individual mosaics arranged in sequence on different levels. Each mosaic consists of individual motifs provided by the members of the AMG Private Lounge Community.
<br /><br /><strong>Black and white – homely atmosphere with clear-cut lines</strong>
<br />The clear, minimalistic architecture characterizes the atmosphere of the AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach. Individually produced furnishings in a conical design form a tapering arrangement towards the terrace area. The colour scheme is black and white, with colour contrasts provided by accessories and unique mementos in the display cabinets. The innovative, variable ceiling lighting creates a suitable, homely atmosphere suited to the time of day, season and weather-induced lighting conditions.
<br />The AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach is divided into different areas. The “brand wall” is devoted entirely to motorsports, as is immediately recognizable by the oversized motif of the SLS AMG GT3, which was hand-made by AMG designers. Opposite the “brand wall” is the “lifestyle wall”, where visitors are able to relax or converse. A selection of media such as an iPad and PlayStation are provided for individual entertainment. A library with a selection of reference material and coffee-table books is an invitation to quiet enjoyment. The homely atmosphere at the “lifestyle wall” is enhanced by exclusive leather furniture whose design is reminiscent of AMG sports seats with its leather upholstery and contrasting topstitching.
<br />The so-called “Silent Space” located at the centre of the AMG Private Lounge is provided for conversation in a private but informal atmosphere. Next to this is the coffee bar, whose rear face features an impressive, fabric-lined photo motif of the SLS AMG on the Paul Ricard race circuit in Le Castellet (southern France) with its distinctive, coloured run-off areas. The large window area affords a view of the 73 square-metre terrace, where visitors are able to relax and converse in the open air on exclusive lounge furniture.
<br /><br /><strong>Regional dishes with a culinary touch</strong>
<br />Behind the coffee bar is the dining area, which is partitioned off and enables up to 18 guests to be catered for. The culinary focus is on light dishes with a regional touch. The atmosphere in the dining area is characterized by a large photographic motif, once again of the SLS AMG on the Paul Ricard race circuit, but this time taken against a backdrop of warm evening sunlight. A semi-transparent sunshade in front of the large glassed area allows a view of a freely-arranged garden in the Japanese Zen style.
<br />The various topic areas of the AMG Private Lounge in Affalterbach are reflected in different flooring designs: parquet, ceramic tiles, different carpeting and wood on the terrace provide a distinctive ambience.

<br /><br />Milestone AMG is regarded by its peers as one of the best Independent Financial Advisory firms in Europe. We believe that even though the markets change on a daily basis, the principles for investing always remain constant.
<br /><br /><strong>PRLog (Press Release) - Apr 10, 2012 - </strong>
<br />Here we look at the benefits, specifically with regards to taxation for UK investors looking to achieve capital security, growth or income. There are a number of advantages to investing offshore, particularly with regards to utilising the tax deferral benefits. You can defer paying tax for the lifetime of the investment, so your investment rolls up without tax being deducted, but you still have to pay tax at your highest rate when you cash the investment in. As a result, with careful planning, a variety of savers could put offshore investments to good use.
<br /><br /><strong>Offshore Investment Vehicles</strong>
<br />The investment vehicles are situated in financial centres located outside the United Kingdom and can add greater diversification to your existing portfolio.
<br />Cash can also be held offshore in deposit accounts, providing you with the choice about when you repatriate your money to the UK, perhaps to add to a retirement fund or to gift to children or grandchildren.
<br />Those who work overseas or have moved abroad to enjoy a different lifestyle often want to pay as little tax as is legally possible.
<br /><br /><strong>Offshore Tax</strong>
<br />Many offshore funds offer tax deferral. The different types of investment vehicles available offshore include offshore bonds that allow the investor to defer tax within the policy until benefits are taken, rather than be subject to a basic rate tax liability within the underlying funds. This means that, if you are a higher rate tax payer in the UK, you could wait until your tax status changes before bringing your funds (and the gains) back into the UK.
<br /><strong>
<br />Investment Types</strong>
<br />The wide choice of different investment types available include
<br /><br />•   offshore redemption policies
<br />•   equity investments
<br />•   initial public offerings
<br />•   personalised policies
<br />•   offshore unit trusts and OEICs.
<br /><br />You may also choose to have access to investments or savings denominated in another currency.
<br />Many banks, insurance companies and asset managers in offshore centres are subsidiaries of major UK, US and European institutions. If you decide to move abroad, you may not pay any tax at all when you cash-in an offshore investment, although this depends on the rules of your new country.
<br />To find out more on how you can receive the benefits of offshore investing, contact one of our advisors today.
<br /><br />In providing greater accuracy in decison making, regulatory and ratings agency compliance; Milestone AMG has fully mastered the art of International business and is at the heart of Europes' Financial Institutions.

<br />Eldridge Financial aired planning to more than triple recycling capacity of Novelis Inc. -the largest supplier of flat-rolled aluminum products to the global auto industry to meet the increased demand by the year 2020.
<br />In an interview of Eldridge Financial to the vice president of global recycling, the capacity may heighten to 2.1 million metric tons by the year 2015 and 4 million tons by 2020 from the current status of 1.2 million tons. Novelis, the U.S. unit of India’s Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL), plans to make 50 percent of its products from recycled metal by 2015 and as much as 80 percent by 2020, from about 39 percent at present, Prichett said in Seoul on Oct. 9. In order for the Novelis meet the expanded recycling target, they will now build plants in Germany and South Korea and doubling the capacity in Brazil. Aluminum demand for auto applications may grow at an average annual rate of 25 percent globally over the next five years, the fastest pace among major markets, he said.
<br />In accordance with the projected increase in auto-parts demand,Eldridge Financial determined that this just really mean a huge growth. Moreover, there’s been a very fast increase in that market in Europe and North America, and doubled the speed in Asia and well as in China. Eldridge Financial released: aluminum futures fell as much as 1.8 percent to $2,017 a ton on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, the lowest price since Sept. 7, and were at $2,020.25 at 5:13 p.m. in Singapore. Alcoa Inc. (AA), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, on Oct. 9 cut its global demand forecast for this year to 6 percent growth from 7 percent, citing slowing Chinese demand.
