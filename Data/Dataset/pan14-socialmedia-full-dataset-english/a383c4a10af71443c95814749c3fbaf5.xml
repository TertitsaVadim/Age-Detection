One interesting thing is that you don’t need to speak sense for you to be a comedian. On the contrary, you can be the most insensitive and still make people scream and jump out of their seats.
<br /><br />Its impressing to see the great emerging numbers of local comedians, with great and beautiful creativity and innovation in the world of comedy. We’ve all seen them on our TV screens and our home videos as well as heard them on our local radio stations. The likes of Machang’i, Kihenjo, Kiere, Zangalewa and King’ang’i among others are just here to make life easier and enjoyable. They were born to make sure people see your teeth and you live longer.
<br /><br />True to say, comedy is getting to greater and greater heights, bearing in mind that creativity has no limits. Meanwhile, let’s learn to appreciate our local comedians.
<br /><br />Kudos our breath takers

Take for example, ‘bano’.  When I was  in primary school, I was the best in ‘bano’ and I believe I could still be the best if I were playing it right now. Who knows, may be I could win some medals and trophies for my country! I remember another one we used to call ‘king kong’,  of which I was not badly off, but my friend Erick could be somewhere in the league table. We cant play these games now, but keeping away does not imply loss of interest. It could be lack of opportunity. Oops! Sijui ni wangapi wananifeel!

It is so clear that God believes in us and gives us the mandate to create together with Him. In Psalms 1:3 the bible says, ‘...and whatsoever you do shall prosper’. God encourages us to be active not to be lazy. So the issue of prospering is in our hands. We work, and God fulfills the promise of blessing the work of our hands the prosperity comes through for us. God has principles which must be followed for us to prosper. Replenishing the earth will involve our hard work. You can’t just seat and eat what you have saved, what will you eat when all the savings are over? You need to continue working to save for the future, and that is just one way of replenishing the earth. Making good use of what is available and creating more for the future. 2Timothy 2:15 the bible says Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
<br /><br />To subdue is to conquer and bring to subjection, Taking thing by force. To bring under mental or emotional control. Man must take charge of his destiny, and to do this he has been given the mandate to subdue, to overcome and bring under control. There is the enemy who must be conquered to take everything thing that he has taken from us. The reason for subduing the enemy is for you to understand that you are more powerful than him the bible says in Luke 9:1 Then he(Jesus) called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. Jesus has given us power and authority over devil to help us fulfill the command given unto us by God- To subdue.
<br /><br />Having dominion is ruling over. God wants us to be leaders, not just to be lead. He not only wants us to rule over people but over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. (KJV)  This is amazing! God really has trusted us with the rest of His creation. To take care of it and to have total control of ourselves. He is faithful to help us obey His commands for He has given us everything we need to obey them.

The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories. Kathy said, &quot;My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made
<br />a mess.&quot; &quot;And what's the moral of the story?&quot; asked the teacher. &quot;Don't put all your eggs in one basket!&quot; &quot;Very good,&quot; said the teacher.
<br /><br />Next little Lucy raised a hand and said, &quot;Our family are farmers, too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're hatched.&quot; &quot;That was a fine story Lucy. Johnny, do you have a story to share?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, ma'am! My daddy told me this story about my Aunt Marge. She was a flight engineer during Desert Storm and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory, and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a Machete. So .. she drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break. Then she landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops. She killed 70 of them with the machine gun until it ran out of bullets! Then she killed 20 more with the machete till the blade broke; then she killed the last 10 with her bare hands.&quot; &quot;Good heavens,&quot; said the horrified teacher, &quot;what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?&quot; &quot;Stay away from Aunt Marge when she's been drinking.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;Outstanding,&quot; Fred replied. &quot;They taught us all the latest psychological techniques - visualization, association - it's made a big difference for me.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;That's great! What was the name of that clinic?&quot; Fred went blank. He thought and thought but couldn't remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, &quot;What do you call that flower with the long stem and thorns?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You mean a rose?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, that's it!&quot; He turned to his wife. &quot;Rose, what was the name of that clinic?&quot;

<br /><br />To get a feel for his audience, he asks them, “How many folk here believe in ghosts?”
<br /><br />About 80 students raise their hands. “That’s a good start,” says the professor, “For those who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you’ve ever seen a ghost?”
<br /><br />About 40 students raise their hands.
<br /><br />“That’s really good,” continues the professor, “I’m really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?”
<br /><br />15 students raise their hands.
<br /><br />“That’s a great response,” remarks the impressed professor, “has anyone here ever touched a ghost?”
<br /><br />3 students raise their hands.
<br /><br />“Brilliant. But let me ask you one question further…
<br /><br />Have any of you ever been intimate with a ghost?”
<br /><br />One of his students from a Redneck state raises his hand.
<br /><br />The professor is astonished. He takes off glasses, takes a step back, and says, “Son, all the years I’ve been giving this lecture, no one has ever claimed that.
<br /><br />You’ve got to come up here and tell us about your experience.” The redneck student replies with a nod and begins to make his way up to the podium. The professor asks, “Well, tell us what it’s like to have made love to a ghost.”
<br /><br />The student replies, “Ghost?!? Dang it!… I thought you said ‘goats.’”
