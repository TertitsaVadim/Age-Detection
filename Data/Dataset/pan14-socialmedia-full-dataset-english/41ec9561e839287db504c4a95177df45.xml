<br />And data from the archaeological perspective, China's most ancient structure with a prototype of the modern rolling bearings, appeared in 221 ~ 207 BC (Qin Dynasty) in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, Xue this cliff village. After the founding of New China, particularly since the seventies of this century, a strong push in the reform and opening up, the bearing industry has entered a new period of rapid development of high quality. In the seventeenth century, the British design and manufacture of ball bearings C. Vallotton, and installed in the postal car, and the United Kingdom P. Worth trial made ball bearings of the patent. HR Hertz eighteenth century Germany made ball bearing contact stress on the paper. Build on the achievements in Hertz, R. Germany, Sweden, Glenn A. Pam, who were a large number of experiments bearing on the development of design theory and contributed to the fatigue life calculation. Subsequently, the Russian NP Petrov apply Newton's law calculation of viscous friction bearings. Leo O. Renault UK discovery of a mathematical analysis of Reynolds equation is derived, from laying the hydrodynamic lubrication theory. Fifty years in the founding of the Chinese bearing industry has made remarkable achievements.

<br />(6) ---- large bearing nominal diameter size range of 440-2000mm bearings. 
<br />(7) significant bearing ---- nominal diameter size range of 2000mm above the bearings. 
<br />Second, its direction can bear the load 
<br />Can be divided into: ? radial bearings, also known as radial bearings, radial load. ? thrust bearing, also known as the thrust bearing, axial load. ? radial thrust bearing, also known as radial thrust bearing to support radial load and axial load. Bearing friction by the different nature of the work can be divided into sliding friction bearings (the bearings) and the rolling friction bearings (the bearings) two broad categories. 
<br />Angular contact bearings: ball and ring contact angle is greater than the nominal 0 °, and less than 90 ° of the bearing. Can support radial load and axial load. Able to work at a high speed. The greater the contact angle, the higher the axial load capacity. High precision and high-speed bearings usually take the contact angle of 15 degrees. Axial force, the contact angle will increase. Single row angular contact ball bearings can withstand axial load in one direction, the radial load, will cause additional axial force. Shaft or housing, and can only limit the axial displacement in one direction. If pairs of double-installed, so a pair of bearing outer ring relative, that the wide end facing wide face, narrow side facing the narrow end. This can avoid additional axial force, but also in both directions so that the shaft or housing to limit axial clearance range. 
<br />Spherical bearings: spherical and has a wide inner ring with a locking piece bearing to the heart. Used mainly for the simple case. 
<br />Linear motion bearings: two on the roller in the rolling direction of a relative linear motion bearings. 
<br />Ball bearings: rolling body is a ball bearing. 
<br />Deep groove ball bearings: a cross-section of each ring are about one-third of the circumference of the ball-type continuous raceway groove radial ball bearings for precision instruments, low noise motors, automobiles, motorcycles and general machinery, the machinery industry, one of the most widely used class of bearings. Simple structure, easy maintenance. Mainly used to bear radial load, but also can withstand a certain degree of axial load, when the radial bearing clearance increased with the performance of angular contact ball bearings can bear large axial load. This kind of bearing friction, high limiting speed, size range and diverse. Solid durability, versatility and low noise operation, can operate at high speed and easy to install. Sealed single row deep groove ball bearings and another design, you can not re-lubrication and no maintenance. Single row ball with gaps and double-row ball bearings, suitable for heavy working conditions. 
<br />Thrust ball bearings: rolling a ball thrust bearing. 
<br />Roller bearings: rolling body is a roller bearing. 
<br />Cylindrical roller bearings: rolling body is a cylindrical roller bearing to the heart, is a separation of bearings, installation and removal is very convenient. Divided into single row cylindrical roller bearings, double row and four columns. 
<br />Installed in accordance with the rolling bearing different number of columns, cylindrical roller bearings can be divided into single row, double row and multi-row cylindrical roller bearings. One application is more cage row cylindrical roller bearings. In addition, single or double row full complement cylindrical roller and other structures of the cylindrical roller bearings. 
<br />Single row cylindrical roller bearings under the ring ribs divided into N-type, NU type, NJ-type, NF-and NUP type. Cylindrical roller bearings under radial load capacity, according to the structure of ring wall can withstand a certain one-way or two-way axial load. 
<br />NNU NN-and double row cylindrical roller bearings, compact structure, rigidity, load capacity, after the deformation under load, mostly for machine tool spindle bearing. 
<br />FC, FCD, FCDP-type four-row cylindrical roller bearings can withstand greater radial load, and more for rolling mills and other heavy machinery. 
<br />Cylindrical roller bearings are used in motors, machine tools, oil, mill machinery and all kinds of industrial material handling machinery. 
<br />Tapered roller bearings: rolling body is tapered roller bearings to the heart. 
<br />Needle roller bearings: rolling body is a needle roller bearing to the heart. 
<br />Spherical roller bearings: rolling body is convex or concave spherical roller bearings tone heart to heart. A convex spherical roller bearings, the outer ring raceway of a spherical shape; a concave roller bearings have a spherical shape of its inner ring raceway. 
<br />Thrust roller bearings: rolling body is a roller thrust bearings. 
<br />Thrust cylindrical roller bearings: rolling body is a cylindrical roller thrust bearings. 
<br />Thrust tapered roller bearings: rolling body is a tapered roller thrust bearing. 
<br />Thrust needle roller bearings: rolling body is a needle thrust bearing. 
<br />Thrust spherical roller bearings: rolling body is convex or concave spherical roller thrust bearing aligning. A convex spherical roller bearing spherical roller ring-shaped, with concave spherical roller bearing raceway ring axis spherical shape. 
<br />Seat belt bearing: Radial bearings together with the seat of a component, in line with the axis parallel to the support bearing on the surface of the base plate mounting screws. 
<br />Bearings: spherical sliding contact surface, mainly used in swinging movement, tilting movement and rotation of the spherical plain bearings. 
<br />Bearings: a bearing while the bearing structure of the two or more combination of rolling bearings. Such as needle roller and thrust cylindrical roller bearings, needle roller and thrust ball bearings, needle roller and angular contact ball bearings and so on. 
<br />Other bearings: In addition to the above other than the structure of the bearing. 
<br />Bearings: Plain bearings, regardless of inner and outer rings are not rolling, generally from wear-resistant materials. Commonly used in low-speed, heavy load and filling oil and difficult to maintain mechanical moving parts. 
<br />Rolling bearings: Rolling bearing is generally used to bear radial load, and the same size deep groove ball bearing, has a large radial load capacity, speed close to the deep groove ball bearings, but this type of bearing with the shaft ? Shell Hole higher, allowing the inner and outer ring axis inclination of the axis is very small (2 ° -4 °), two-axis tilt, such as beyond the limits of roller and ring raceway contact situation will be worsened seriously affect the load bearing capacity, reduce bearing life. Therefore, these bearings such as axial load needs to be installed in the role of host components, only the simultaneous use of other types of bearings to carry axial load of the premise, before use. 
<br />More generally described as rolling bearings (ball and roller bearing). Rolling is the operation of the shaft and the sliding friction between the axle seat to rolling friction, thus reducing the friction loss of a precision mechanical components. Generally bearing outer ring, inner ring, rolling body and cage components. Rolling easy maintenance, reliable, good starting performance, carrying capacity in the medium high speed. Compared with the sliding bearing, radial bearing large size, the less vibration, high speed, low life sounds great. 
<br />Rolling bearings in to the heart (mainly radial force) are generally the inner ring, outer ring, rolling and rolling body cage 4 parts. On the inner sleeve and the journal together with the shaft rotation, the outer ring installed in the bearing hole. In the inner and outer peripheral are made within the week on a roller. When the relative rotation of inner and outer rings, rolling the scroll, including the outer ring raceway, they are separated by a cage, to avoid rubbing against each other. 
<br />Tight ring and thrust bearing live ring divided in two parts. Tight tight circle with the sleeve, live in the bearing seat bearing ring. Rings and rolling bodies are usually high strength, good wear resistance bearing steel, the surface hardness after quenching should reach HRC60 ~ 65. Cage is made more pressing with the soft steel, copper alloys can also be used bakelite cloth or plastic and other manufacturing.

It is said that up to • Leonardo • Leonardo around 1500 ball bearings have been of a description. The various factors bearing immature, there are a very important point is that collisions will occur between the ball, causing additional friction. But you can put the ball into a small cage to prevent this phenomenon. The 17th century, Galileo on the &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;fixed ball&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;, or &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;cage ball&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; and did the first description of ball bearings. But in the following for a long time, install the bearings on the machine has not been realized. The first patent is on the ball channel Carmarthen Philip • Vaughan received in 1794.

<br />  (1) It consists of an outer ring, an inner ring, a cage ball and a set of components. 
<br />  (2) It is mainly exposed to pure radial loads, you can also take United to the load. When its time under pure radial load, the contact angle is zero; when it has a large radial play, which has the properties of angular contact bearings, can bear large axial load. Deep groove ball bearing friction, high limiting speed, so when the axial load high-speed rotation, it is more than the superiority of thrust ball bearings. However, due to aligning its performance is limited, so the bearings installed concentricity must be high, otherwise it will affect the balance of its operation, increase bearing stress, thus shortening the working life. 
<br />  (3) deep groove ball bearing structure is simple and easy to reach a higher accuracy than the other, it can become a mass production. In addition to conventional models, but it also has a variety of structural variations, such as deep groove ball bearings with dust cover, deep groove ball bearings with rubber ring and a groove deep groove ball bearings and so on. 
<br />    1) deep groove ball bearings with dust cover 
<br />Standard deep groove ball bearings with dust cover, with Z-and 2Z-type (NSK called ZZ-type) two. Generally more difficult to use in a separate lubrication, placement and inspection of lubricating oil lubrication condition is not convenient, usually injected into the internal anti-rust bearings, lubrication, dual-use lithium grease inside the bearing space is 1 / 4 to 1 / 3; 
<br />2) deep groove ball bearing with seals 
<br />Standard deep groove ball bearings with seals seals bearing RS-contact type (NSK termed DDU type, side seals) and 2RS type (both sides seal) and non-contact type sealed bearings RZ (NSK termed VV type, side seal ) and 2RZ type. Performance, filling fat, uses the same bearing and with a dust cover, dust cover and the difference is that with large gaps between the inner ring, instead of the sealing lip contact with the inner ring gap is small, contact ring bearing the seal lip and there is no gap between the inner ring, sealing effect, but the friction coefficient increased. 
<br />3) groove and snap ring with a deep groove ball bearings 
<br />Standards are groove deep groove ball bearings as the post-code N, there are only moving with snap ring groove and the deep groove ball bearings as a post-code HR. In addition, ZN, ZNR other structural variations. With snap ring groove ball bearings can withstand radial loads in addition to function, the stop ring can also limit the axial displacement of the bearing, bearing simplify the structure and reduce the bearing size. More commonly used in cars, tractors and other parts of the axial load is not working. 
<br />4) deep groove ball bearing ball gap 
<br />There are gaps in the standard deep groove ball bearings ball has 200,300 two diameter series. Inside and outside the ring on the side of the gap, can result into more goals, to increase its radial load capacity. However, due to axial load capacity is relatively small, not high-speed operation. If there is a large axial load, needs and general use with deep groove ball bearings. 
<br />5) Double row deep groove ball bearings 
<br />Standard double row deep groove ball bearings 4200A, 4300A. A no ball bearing gap. 
<br />      6) single row deep groove ball bearings 
<br />Single row deep groove ball bearings, friction torque, for high-speed rotation, low noise, low vibration case. In addition to open, there are bearings with steel dust cover, rubber seals bearings, pressed steel cage.

When the deep groove ball bearings with a larger radial clearance, the performance with angular contact bearings, can withstand large axial load. Deep groove ball bearing friction coefficient is small, speed is also high, especially in large high speed axial load conditions, deep groove ball bearings Thrust ball bearings are more than advantages.

<br />Single row bearings can only carry axial load in one direction, the radial load, will cause additional axial force. Shaft or housing, and can only limit the axial displacement in one direction. If pairs of double-installed, so a pair of bearing outer ring relative, that the wide end facing wide face, narrow side facing the narrow end. This can avoid additional axial force, but also in both directions so that the shaft or housing to limit axial clearance range. Angular contact ball bearing as many as 70 kinds of variable structure. 
<br />2.1 The nominal contact angle 15 °, 25 °, 40 ° three, the greater the contact angle the higher the axial load capacity. High precision and high-speed bearing 15 ° contact angle is usually taken in the axial force, the contact angle will increase. 
<br />2.2 The inner or outer ring is generally locking the mouth, the outer ring can not be separated. After expansion of the outer ring and inner ring heating, rolling, cage component assembly. Ball a few more than the deep groove ball bearings, ball bearings rated load in maximum rigidity, smooth operation. 
<br />2.3 can make use of inner and outer radial clearance between the displacement adjustment. Often used in pairs, and pre-load applied to improve the bearing stiffness.

<br />China is the world's first invention bearing one of the countries in the Chinese classics, the axle bearing on the structure has long been documented. And data from the archaeological perspective, China's most ancient structure with a prototype of the modern rolling bearings, appeared in 221 ~ 207 BC (Qin Dynasty) in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, Xue this cliff village. After the founding of New China, particularly since the seventies of this century, a strong push in the reform and opening up, the bearing industry has entered a new period of rapid development of high quality. In the seventeenth century, the British design and manufacture of ball bearings C. Vallotton, and installed in the postal car, and the United Kingdom P. Worth trial made ball bearings of the patent. HR Hertz eighteenth century Germany made ball bearing contact stress on the paper. Build on the achievements in Hertz, R.Germany, Sweden, Glenn A. Pam, who were a large number of experiments bearing on the development of design theory and contributed to the fatigue life calculation. Subsequently, the Russian NP Petrov apply Newton's law calculation of viscous friction bearings. Leo O. Renault UK discovery of a mathematical analysis of Reynolds equation is derived, from laying the hydrodynamic lubrication theory. Fifty years in the founding of the Chinese bearing industry has made remarkable achievements.
