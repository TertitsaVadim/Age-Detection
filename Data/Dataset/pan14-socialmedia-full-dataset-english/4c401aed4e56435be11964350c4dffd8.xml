<br /><br />The roots of violence are not always what you think.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>Samir Franjieh is convinced.

<br /><br />The European situation is dramatic. Nothing seems to stop the debt crisis, public and private, between the political upheaval in Greece and the discovery of the extent of banking sector problems.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.karenmillendressesmartuk.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.karenmillendressesmartuk.com</a></a>European banks troubled countries have used the liquidity of the ECB to buy sovereign debt. If it has temporarily relieved the market of government securities, the collateral effect was to tie the fate of more states than their banks. The Spanish banking sector, which gave a vengeance, financing a speculative bubble in real estate, shows € 184 billion of bad loans in real estate sector alone. Gorging these banks for government securities while the Spanish state itself is very delicate amounts to make it even more suspicious investors of all that is Spanish.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>Meanwhile across Europe are trying to correct deficits, certainly aggravated by the economic downturn, but created by years of mismanagement. Austerity and created widespread unemployment, causes of bankruptcies. Waves of suicides are reported in Southern Europe, while anxiety invades millions of people, unable to survive with dignity, losing confidence in their abilities. Yet it is not denying the TSCG that the eurozone will survive. On the one hand this is unacceptable for Germany, the first donor. Moreover, it is ineffective, most rules of the Treaty is already in effect since December 2011 and the vote of the European regulations &quot;six-pack&quot;.
<br /><br />However, blindly pursue the austerity, karen millen dresses or continue to inject public money into banks, would be socially and politically suicidal. The banking issue of 2007, and nothing has changed. Inject capital directly into the banking sector as proposed by some would stop the suspect, to restart the credit on a sound basis and therefore the economy. But this path would be politically suicidal for the EU. We should explain to taxpayers and why we continue to pay hundreds of billions to rescue banks while billions that could avoid extreme poverty to millions of people are never found in the folds of public spending.
<br /><br />President Francois Hollande is betting on an economic recovery through investments. But the four points of the memorandum does not create enough nor fast enough growth. On the other hand the conception of &quot;growth&quot; is not the same in Paris,karen millen outlet or Rome, Berlin, London, where it does mean liberalization of the labor market and the services sector.
<br /><br />This is why we must act differently. Angela Merkel and Mario Monti negotiate simultaneous ratification of TSCG. This may partly isolate Francois Hollande on the European stage while France and Italy share the same interest at the moment (as in Spain for that matter). Francois Hollande should support the proposal by Mario Monti, which is that of calculating deficits differently. The TSCG talks about structural deficit that must be limited to 0.5% of GDP. But future investments generating growth can not be regarded as tax breaks under the structural deficit. If such a proposal was needed, we would gain a considerable leeway.
<br /><br />Moreover, Germany is now benefiting from interest rates below inflation and near zero through the crisis, after being the first recipient of the common market. This distortion must be corrected by the pooling of a portion of the debt of member states, transferring at European level. It would be much more acceptable to Berlin for an inflationary policy the ECB, real taboo psychological Berlin. Also create inflation, affect less affluent populations. Once settled the issue of public debt should clean the balance sheets of the banking sector. The European Solidarity Mechanism (SPM) may well have to be used to recapitalize banks.
<br /><br />But instead of lending to banks, karen millen sale the EU should impose the abandonment of interest on bad loans of small businesses or citizens who have lost a job or being on the brink of bankruptcy. MES could guarantee the capital, and reschedule payments of citizens in difficulty. This cleanse bank balance sheets, and give a breath of fresh air to the poor. For once, give the image of an EU that helps people rather than banks. Symbols count in politics, Francois Hollande knows.

<br /><br />The economic, political and social in Greece but also its financial position is much worse than before the implementation of the rescue plan that has been working since mid-2011 the leaders of the eurozone,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>the European Central Bank (EC<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The overall debt of Greece has become higher than it was before the release of the first tranche of early 2012: indebted to a creditor lend at rates higher than its initial debt, when economic growth is zero or negative and the low level of inflation, can only worsen its debt.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen sale</a>This plan is vital to avoid an uncontrolled failure of Greece, momentarily reassured all partners of the euro area. But he allowed only to save time.
<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the rulers did not use this grace period, karen millen sale from late 2011 to March 2012, to place the center of the debate the real issue, the risk of bursting of the euro area, rather than leave imposed by the timing drift of the Greek situation. This scenario would start with the output of Greece. Already the Greek banking system has seen its deposits melt a third in two years (240 billion euros in early 2010 to 170 in the first quarter 2012), and this situation has recently accelerated. If the beginning of Greek investors' concern has not yet affected other European investors, we observe that the major European groups have started to withdraw deposits from banks and 'peripheral' countries. This is a crisis in its banking system that the eurozone could well explode.
<br /><br />In the next three weeks, we must first solve the financial problem Greek: Greek debt, 375 billion, much of which is due to the creditors of the euro area, is insignificant amounts in terms of macroeconomic area and suffers daily losses that all of its scholarships for several weeks. To avoid the exit of Greece before or after June 17, there is no other way that a new plan to restructure its overall debt, which includes not only that of the Greek state, but also Overall household debt and Greek companies. It will make further write-offs, karen millen dresses that is to say, the destruction of debt, so money, and thus capital. Added to this is a remaining balance spread over several decades. The losses will be borne by the taxpayers of Europe, European banks and other investors, international banks. By itself, such a restructuring will not be enough, unless we add the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for Greece. We must then immediately take up the case of Spain first, then Portugal and Ireland, even more threatening to the survival of the euro area. Avoiding procrastination same as on Greece: the longer you wait, the greater the losses will be large.
<br /><br />With Greece, it was to prevent the loss initially anticipated worsening admitting at the outset that she could never repay, loaded with abyssal deficits discovered too late by its partners, and growth of Suffering negatively proportional to the austerity plan applied to it. Not having sufficient time accepted this evidence, the euro area has worsened the loss potential of this country. Europe must now cope in an emergency, to issue a more worrying: the contagion, the vector of a Spanish banking crisis, then Portuguese and Irish. To avoid this, we must quickly consider a bold plan to restructure the debt of these countries. This is a purely political decision. Without such an approach, karen millen outlet the breakup of the euro area becomes an inevitable scenario, including the financial consequences would far exceed the amount of debt the only Greek.

<br /><br />Barack Obama and Francois Hollande have more than one reason to agree, karen millen dresses both advocate a return to growth and are supporters of Keynesian stimulus policies after decades of orthodox neoliberalism. Both have campaigned for the withdrawal of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, costly relics of the Bush-Blair. If Francois Hollande has not generated the same fervor in 2012 Obama in 2008, the crisis has dampened the euphoria meantime voters, both carried the same message of reconciliation and healing ahead of countries divided by policies of their predecessors fracture. Finally, by focusing on state action in favor of education and health, their campaigns have brought to the forefront the desire for more equality and solidarity, while their opponents insist more on individual performance and meritocracy.

In this country-continent legatee of very old injustices, which still squeak immemorial oppression of caste, there are symbols to avoid for fear of inflaming the dispute. The designer Shankar Pillai (1902-1989), who was a master of caricature press in India between 1940 and 1980, has become a victim posthumously. One of his cartoons,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.karenmillendressesmartuk.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.karenmillendressesmartuk.com</a></a>reproduced in a textbook (Civics) 1st and featuring the famous whip, unleashed a furious storm in mid-May in the aisles of Parliament in New Delhi. Before the uproar, the government decided to remove from the textbook in question. Indian intellectuals keen on academic freedom are in shock. Now the question is on everyone's lips:<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>&quot;Can we still laugh in India?&quot;
<br /><br />The design of Shankar Pillai in 1949, a time at once heroic and tragic when India, still traumatized by the bloody partition with Pakistan two years earlier, tried to lay the foundations for a modern democratic state.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen sale</a>The big challenge then was to draft a constitution honoring the vision of the Founding Fathers, combining idealism secularism and equal rights. The chairman of the editorial board of this Constitution was the lawyer Bhimrao Ambedkar (1891-1956), spokesman of the community of Untouchables (or Dalits) - the most oppressed caste system of Hindu socio-religious. The development of the Basic Law took time, three years in total. Overcome the contradictions of a society to dizzying diversity (religion, ethnicity, language, caste ...) was not a sinecure.
<br /><br />To illustrate the stalled discussions, Shankar Pillai Ambedkar draws so riding a snail, symbol of the Constitution. Dalit leader holds in his right hand a whip expected to stimulate the snail race, but the effort seems rather pointless. Behind him, Jawaharlal Nehru, another founding father (and companion of Gandhi), grabbed a whip firmly, staring at the snail to embolden. This is the scene that lit the controversy. Why is it shocking? For some activists of the cause of the untouchables, karen millen sale the posture of the Brahmin Nehru (elite Hindu hierarchy) armed with a whip in the back of the Ambedkar Dalit awakens the memory of historical violence suffered by the lower castes. In this it would be &quot;offensive&quot;, &quot;degrading&quot; to someone as revered today Ambedkar. Never mind that the intention of the cartoonist was radically different, if his mockery was intended that the spectacle of these two pioneers of modern India toiling to hasten the advance of the snail constitutional. No matter, because there is a Brahmin, a Dalit and a whip. In India, you do not compromise - no more kids - with the symbols.
<br /><br />The case was widely publicized. The sacked by Dalit activists in the office of Professor of University of Pune (Maharahstra) co-author added to the passions. Two opposing positions, hard. On the one hand, karen millen dresses defenders of the untouchables are irritated easy irony of some intellectuals from the upper castes having no idea of ??the state of veneration in which is still held today in Ambedkar Dalit. At the end of his life, Ambedkar sessions sponsored mass conversion to Buddhism of his community in a spectacular gesture of rejection of Hinduism deemed oppressive. &quot;He gave a soul to those who did not,&quot; writes the weekly Kancha Ilaiah Outlook the university. As such, it would become a &quot;prophet&quot; in the eyes of the wretched of the earth in search of liberation. But it does not offend a prophet in India.
<br /><br />This is precisely what worries the advocates of freedom of expression and critical thinking. They said the new religiosity that pervades the public space, where the heroes of yesterday are deified, where politics turns worship violates the secularism enshrined in the Constitution of 1950. Many progressive intellectuals, however, supporters of the emancipation of Dalits, give a thumbs. They believe that democratic debate is beginning to be dangerously perverted by the rise of victimhood complex. India has now entered the era of vindictive ballad of &quot;hurt feelings&quot;. Hindus, Muslims and Dalits parade today and sometimes vandalize a work from artistic or intellectual &quot;hurt&quot; their &quot;feelings&quot;. Even the small Christian minority in 2006 had expressed support for a ban of the film Da Vinci Code. &quot;The growing influence across the country this policy hurt feelings is alarming,&quot; said in the weekly Tehelka Mukul Manglik, professor of history at New Delhi.
<br /><br />The result is there. The superstar of contemporary art in India, Maqbool Fida Hussein (1915-2011), persecuted by Hindu extremists, karen millen outlet had taken refuge in Qatar before dying in exile. The Indian-born British writer Salman Rushdie, still threatened by Muslim extremists for his Satanic Verses (1988), had to give up in January at the Book Fair of Jaipur. And now, a cartoon from 1949 served textbooks pressure untouchables. In Tehelka, Shoma Chaudhury columnist asks: &quot;Have we become a society so intolerant?&quot;

The opportunity of a fourth operator in France has been debated for years. ARCEP, the industry regulator, ardently defended in principle because the market was not competitive enough, and prices too high. His opponents, the three operators 'historical', Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom, swore that the market was already saturated and that there would be massive layoffs.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>President Nicolas Sarkozy was not very hot, his prime minister, Francois Fillon, has finally won in the summer of 2009 ...
<br /><br />In one respect at least, everyone agrees: with its packages &quot;low cost&quot; (2 euros and 19.99 euros),<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>Free Mobile has recruited 2.6 million customers in two and a half months, and triggered a Industrial earthquake - the word is not too strong as its competitors - <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen sale</a>whose effects are just beginning to be felt.
<br /><br />Returning to the balance sheet. Undeniably, it is good for the consumer, who won in purchasing power. Those who already had a phone line and bought a SIM Free or one of its competitors - all lined up with offers &quot;SIM only&quot; - have divided their bill by at least two. To prevent bleeding, the operators also drop the price of their offer &quot;upscale&quot;. All packages together, with or without subsidy from the phone, &quot;the average monthly bill for mobile client is expected to fall by 8% in 2012, karen millen outlet and 8.5% in 2013,&quot; according to a note from the management company CM-CIC Securities.
<br /><br />And bids are more readable: Free only two formulas, the others try now also play simplicity. And many analysts believe the market will bipolariser. There will be packages sold on the Internet, without subsidy from the phone, less than 25 euros per month. And high-end phone with Grant, 30 to 60 euros per month.
<br /><br />Another argument of &quot;pro-Free&quot; which appears to be true, at least in the first quarter: the mobile market is expanding, so there's room for a new player. According to ARCEP, the number of SIM increased by 854,000 in the first quarter. For analysts of Oddo, 7 million French have changed their plan in the first quarter!
<br /><br />At this stage, the &quot;anti-free&quot; have also been right. The arrival of the fourth operator has made them lose many customers in the first quarter: 620 000 for SFR 615,000 for Orange, Bouygues Telecom for 379 000 ... And, according to analysts, karen millen dresses it should begin their financial performance substantially in the coming months. The revenue per subscriber of the three operators is expected to decline by an average of 14% in 2012 and 12% in 2013, CM-CIC Securities. As for their earnings, it would sell 16% in 2012 and 10% in 2013 ...
<br /><br />Will they also right on the job front? For now, any social was formally announced. SFR, unions ensure that management told them in early May it was considering a social plan. Bouygues Telecom has launched a plan to save 300 million euros, and agreed to revise its contracts with its subcontractors. At Orange, it is unlikely that there will be layoffs: two thirds of the staff are French officials and the crisis of suicide is not that far. The average age (48 years) allows management to rely on retirements.
<br /><br />A few weeks ago, ARCEP launched a figure of 10,000 job cuts possible in the Telecom sector. So far, this was the only data that flowed. Deffains Bruno, a professor at the University of Paris 2 (Panthéon-Assas), has just written a study, which results in a much more alarming assessment. Starting from a total of 342,000 jobs related to mobile in France, his screenplay of &quot;reference&quot; corresponds to a net destruction of 61,600 jobs over two years: 10 600 among operators, 35,200 in partners (distributors, service), and 15 800 job losses induced (outsourcing, etc..) ... Another scenario, &quot;most likely&quot;, according to Bruno Deffains, bet on the preservation of 10,100 jobs, karen millen sale with the resumption of investment in networks. It still concludes the final 51 500 posts in less ...
<br /><br />These figures are disputed by economists who denounce the non-inclusion of direct jobs created (900) and indirect Free Mobile. We should have also assess gains in purchasing power into the economy, they said. Besides, they add, that the operators could easily withstand a drop in revenue due, as they were profitable so far.
<br /><br />Odds are that even challenged, these figures could be recovered. Not only by competitors Free: unions also complain that the preference was given to the consumer at the expense of employees. Many of them want to organize a foundation of telecom in early July. The initiative is part of the union UNSA Technicolor and was echoed by representatives of the CFE-CGC Orange. This is to educate the new administration in the sector upheaval. On an issue as delicate, what the position of Arnaud Montebourg, the minister of productive recovery? In January, on Twitter, it was one of the few to have welcomed the launch of Free Mobile ...

The report of the United Nations Fund for Children compares two types of poverty in most advanced economies in the world:<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen outlet</a>one based on deprivation of children, the other measuring relative poverty. Based on 2009 data, it ignores the consequences of the economic crisis.
<br /><br />The first criterion for comparison,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen sale</a>a deprivation index, indicates the proportion of children without access in each country at least two of 14 variables considered normal (eg, three meals a day of fruits and vegetables every days).<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYXJlbm1pbGxlbmRyZXNzZXNtYXJ0dWsuY29t" target="_blank">karen millen dresses</a>Result: in 31 European countries considered, 15% of children are &quot;deprived&quot; of at least two essential elements.
<br /><br />The highest rates of deprivation are in the poorest countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal (respectively 70%, 50% and 27%). The Nordic countries the lowest rates, below 3%. Among the 14 richest countries, both have a child deprivation rate exceeds 10%: France (10.1%) and Italy (13.3%). Yet France is the country with the highest public karen millen outlet spending for children (3.7% of GDP against 2.2% for the average of the countries studied), the report said.
<br /><br />IN FRANCE, THE &quot;GROSS POVERTY&quot; THE FRIEZE 20%
<br /><br />The second test is investigated relative poverty, the percentage of children living in households with disposable incomes, adjusted for size and family composition, is less than 50% of national median income of the country where they live. Again, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands have the lowest rates of relative poverty for children, about 7%. In contrast, over 20% of children from Romania and the United States live in relative poverty. Only Denmark, Finland, Iceland, karen millen dresses the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Cyprus are classified for both criteria.
<br /><br />&quot;The comparison between similar countries shows that government policies can have a significant impact on the lives of children,&quot; said Unicef. For example, Denmark and Sweden have rates much lower deprivation than Belgium or Germany, although these four countries have similar levels of economic development and per capita income, the fund said.
<br /><br />The report also indicates that the poverty rate of children in France gross (before tax and benefits) is close to 20% but was offset by compensatory measures which reduce the rate to 8.8% of children in relative poverty . This places France in the 14th position of the 35 countries studied. &quot;France is investing in significant financial benefits, karen millen sale tax credits or family policy, which has an obvious impact, but perhaps less effective than in other countries,&quot; said Nathalie Serruques, responsible mission for Unicef ??childhood in France. Some countries are much more powerful: with lower spending, the more strongly they reduce child poverty, argues the fund.
