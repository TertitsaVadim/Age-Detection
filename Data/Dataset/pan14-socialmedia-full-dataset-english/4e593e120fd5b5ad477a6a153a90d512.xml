<br /><br />As the dollar declines so the price of precious metals trends up and silver gold and platinum dealers across the US and the wider world are seeing more and more individual investors turning to gold; in the US many shrewd investors are creating a gold and silver IRA, which is more efficient for tax and unlike paper currency based investments such as stocks, shares and bonds which while giving reduced returns still have a higher rate of tax attached to them.
<br /><br />Make the decision to buy gold and silver investment products as soon as you possibly can and avoid the coming losses investors will see in their portfolios who are not as shrewd an operator as you.

<br /><br />Gold silver and platinum dealers will tell anyone that wants to know that precious metals and their price is governed by supply and demand only whereas currencies can be manipulated with ease.
<br /><br />Investors who have an IRA currency based vehicle should seriously consider rolling it over to a gold and silver IRA before their current situation loses too much value.
<br /><br />There is a bigger storm brewing than the one buffeting the US right now – just don’t have regrets for not being prepared and ‘putting your ship in a safe haven’.

<br /><br />Under the terms of the 1933 Coinage Act, certified, rare and collectable gold coin products cannot be confiscated by the US government to prop up and safeguard the dollar at any time.
<br /><br />The dollar is ailing, and if Uncle Sam could get his hands on your wealth, have no fear he would.
<br /><br />American gold coin investors are turning more and more to these delicate and exquisite collectables to protect their future wealth with many investors transferring their IRA retirement fund into gold.
<br /><br />Gold coins that are a rarity are excellent investments as well as beautiful looking and a pleasure to own.

<br /><br />Certified gold bullion coins also hold a certain fiat value from their respective country of origin whereby investors are able to rest assured that the value of the bullion coins which they buy will never fall below that value.
<br /><br />Gold in all its forms has always been used through the ages by mankind as a safe haven for protection of their wealth and as a hedge against financial and political insecurity.
<br /><br />And boy is America suffering from both at the moment. The weakest president in living memory and a Federal reserve buying up as much debt as possible is it any wonder more and more investors are flocking to gold as a safe haven.

<br /><br />The current policies of the Federal Reserve and the White House puppet combine with external forces to create the perfect storm in the ever moving sea of finance and politics.
<br /><br />Commodity prices and certainly gold bullion prices continue to rise parallel to the dollar’s fall, and the current price of gold has a long way to go before it even begins to peak especially if historic gold prices, charts and pointers are all to be believed.
<br /><br />Protecting future wealth and security is best achieved through shrewd investment in bullion products – but do it now because demand is only going to get stronger and force prices even higher than they are now.

<br />Amazing prices and some of the best deals around with stock regularly changing and new lines arriving every week, combined with regular sales and clearance lines you really can have the kids looking good on a budget, especially in today’s tight financial climate.
<br />And maybe, just maybe, the older ones who have a fashion sense beyond their years may just stop moaning about what clothes they have to wear.
<br />If they had to spend their own money, they might just realize how much it costs to look trendy, although at Adams, it isn't so much.

<br />Her vision was to manufacture and sell affordable clothes to the hard pressed families of the difficult years of the time, and to this day those principles have held sway, so much so that Adams thrives in the era of the internet, a far cry from selling clothes from Amy’s house all those years ago, seventy nine years of continued success and relief for parent’s budgets everywhere.
<br />Take a look in today, a window into a store of fashion for kids at a price which will leave you with change for more.

Yet this was way back in the 1930s before discount shopping, multiple chains and retail outlets and the birth of the consumer society and fab and fashionable children’s clothes was a must for young adults, as they are referred to nowadays.
<br />Selling initially from her front room, the same principles are to be found running through the entire fabric of the modern day internet based business some seventy nine years on, with a continually changing stock of fashion clothing for kids from newborn right through to twelve years old.
<br />Mums and dads can now take a breather from seemingly ever increasing prices and ever diminishing incomes and ensure their kids are well clothed, with change to spare.
<br />Delivered direct to your door, kids need to look on the website now; otherwise they will only complain when you buy them something which they didn't choose. Bet Amy Adams never had THAT problem.

<br />Adams’ buyers seem to have the knack of sourcing baby clothes and kids clothes suitable for up to twelve years old, and because they only stock kids clothes their buying power is enhanced and the bigger savings made on buying in are passed on to parents, fulfilling the founding principles of the founder of the company, Amy Adams.
<br />A new web generation of kids are getting ‘turned on’ to the ‘Adams effect’ the one of looking trendy, hip and chic as my granddaughter would say.
<br />She loves nothing more than giving us a ‘twirl’ when mummy has bought her some new clothes. Now maybe she will be able to do it that little more often with fab ‘Adams family values’ kids clothing.
