<br />Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
<br />Another story of the bitter pills of fate
<br />I can't go back again
<br />I can't go back again
<br />But you asked me to love you, and I did.
<br />Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
<br />And when I got away, I only got so far
<br />The other me is dead
<br />I hear his voice inside my head
<br />And we were never alive
<br />And we won't be born again
<br />But I'll never survive
<br /><br />With dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br /><br />You told me to love you, and I did.
<br />Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
<br />So when I got away, I only kept my scars
<br />The other me is gone
<br />Now I don't know where I belong
<br />And we were never alive
<br />And we won't be born again
<br />But I'll never survive
<br /><br />With dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br /><br />Dead visions in your name
<br />Dead fingers in my veins
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart
<br />Dead memories in my heart

<br />The child of burning time 
<br /><br />My only consolation is all lies 
<br />The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight 
<br />Winter hasn't ended and it always looks like rain 
<br />I can't remember anything...anything 
<br />Inside the absolution, we succumb 
<br />And appetites are bittersweet I think I'm going numb 
<br />A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret 
<br />The child of burning time has gone, he hasn't 
<br />come back, he hasn't come back yet 
<br /><br />Before I tell my story please consider who I am 
<br />I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can 
<br />A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away

<br />A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame 
<br />And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it all apart 
<br />I beg you burn me away, I won't become your 
<br />hero just to fight the life I saved 
<br />Burn me away, I won't give up tommorow just to lose it all today 
<br /><br />I burn away I burn away I burn away I burn away 
<br /><br />My isolation is my course 
<br />The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on it's source 
<br />I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame 
<br />Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage 
<br /><br />And I cut my need into my soul, I guess I'll never know 
<br />I beg you burn me away, I won't become your 
<br />hero just to fight the life I saved 
<br />Burn me away, I won't give up tommorow just to lose it all today 
<br /><br />Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life I saved 
<br />Burn me away, I wont give up tommorow just to 
<br />lose it all, lose it all today

<br />Plenty of room at the Hotel California,
<br />Any time of year, (Any time of year) You can find it here
<br /><br />Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,
<br />She got the Mercedes Benz,
<br />She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
<br />she calls friends
<br />How they dance in the courtyard,
<br />Sweet summer sweat
<br />Some dance to remember,
<br />Some dance to forget
<br /><br />So I called up the Captain
<br />&quot;Please bring me my wine&quot;
<br />He said, &quot;We haven't had that spirit here
<br />Since nineteen sixty-nine&quot;
<br />And still those voices are calling from far away,
<br />Wake you up in the middle of the night
<br />Just to hear them say:
<br /><br />Welcome to the Hotel California,
<br />Such a lovely place, (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face
<br />They're livin' it up at the Hotel California,
<br />What a nice surprise, (What a nice surprise) Bring your alibis
<br /><br />Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice, and she said:
<br />&quot;We are all just prisoners here,
<br />Of our own device&quot;
<br />And in the master's chambers
<br />They gathered for the feast,
<br />They stabbed it with their steely knives,
<br />But they just can't kill the beast
<br /><br />Last thing I remember, I was running for the door,
<br />I had to find the passage back to the place I was before,
<br />&quot;Relax,&quot; said the night man, &quot;We are programmed to receive,
<br />You can check out anytime you like... but you can never leave&quot;

<br />The goddes descends from the sky
<br />Wings of light and dark spread afar
<br />She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting
<br /><br />ACT 1
<br />Infinite in mystery is the gift of the goddes
<br /> We seek it thus, and take it to the sky
<br /> Ripples form on the water's surface
<br />  The wandering soul knows no rest
<br /><br />ACT 2
<br />There is no hate, only joy
<br />for u are beloved by the godess
<br /> Hero of the dawn, Healer of worlds
<br />Dreams of the morrow hath 
<br />the shattered poul
<br /> Pride is lost
<br />Wings stripped away,
<br />the end is nigh
<br /><br />ACT 3
<br /> My freind, do u fly away now?
<br /> To a world that abhors you and i
<br /> All that awaits u is a somber morrow
<br />No matter where the winds my blow
<br /> My freind ur desire is the bringer of life,
<br />the gift of the goddes
<br />Even if the morrow is barren of promises
<br /> Nothing shall forestall my return
<br /><br />ACT 4
<br />My freind, the fates are cruel
<br />Thare are no dreames, not honour remains
<br />The arrow has left the bow of the goddes
<br />My soul, corrupted by vengeance
<br />Hath endured torment 
<br /> to find the end of the joumey
<br />In my own salvation 
<br />And ur eternal sluber
<br />Legend shall speak of sacrifice at worlds end
<br />The wind sails over the water's sirface
<br />Quietly, but surely
<br /><br />ACT 5
<br />Even if the morrow is barren of promises
<br /> Nothing shall forestall my return
<br />To become the dew that quebches the land
<br />To spare the sands, the seas, the skies
<br />I offer three this silent sacrifice

<br /><br />the quest,twas useless.
<br />	those who followed,were fools regardless,
<br />	of reasons they hold unto themselves.
<br />	twas all a game of mine to seeeeeeeee.
<br />	to seee if any would follow the quest,
<br />	the quest of ironic ETH ELBILLUG.
<br />	Now i laught at fools with greed and curiosity,
<br />	now i laught at the mockers who wanna hav a good time
<br />	For ETH ELBILLUG is the greatest laught of all.
<br />	hahahaaaaah the jokes on you all and if u havnt realized
<br />	if u havnt realized wat ETH ELBILLUG is yet then ur more the fool,
<br />	then you will ever realize.
<br />	lets rewind back to the 1st folder,
<br />	how it warned u not to continue on your futile effort.
<br />	the warnings were so clear,the path so dissuading,
<br />	but pure stubborness and curiosity is champion to all.
<br />	Praise to those who left broken and defeated,
<br />	better praise to those who never even bothered
<br />	for ETH ELBILLUG is a laughter that they can share along with me.
<br />	But lets take a moment to wat ETH GULLIBLE truelli is and means.
<br />	just a moment for those who do not see yet
<br />	do u,do they,i know i do,see wat it is ,understand wat it means
<br />	those who do,it is up to u for us to continue,
<br />	to tell or not to tell,nahnahnahnahnah,fast forward to middle near the end
<br />	have u all, u all realized these lyrics are a crude mockery ,
<br />	perhaps no longer lyric ,off beat and broken,
<br />	heh tis a same but that is wat the plan is ,another part of ETH ELBILLUG's quest
<br />	ohhh u fools shoulda listened shoulda listened to the folders ,but i must resist
<br />	resist the rising lunacy of THE GULLIBLE,now u see
<br />	hahahaaaah now u seeeee hahahah now u seeee
<br />	u shouldnt of went for the quest of ETH ELBILLUG,
<br />	the quest was all a game to me to see if any would play with me,
<br />	fun for me and maybe not for you , but u see the fool u be,
<br />	the plan oh so simple , ussual stuff they use in essay really 
<br />	hook and sinker,i know of one who would bite and others who may nibble,
<br />	but i must finish, my mock has gone on too much. i just hope 
<br />                                     i can play with   you all again some day.

<br />when all there was to drink was nothin but cups of tea. 
<br />Along came a man by the name of Charlie Mops, 
<br />and he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops. 
<br /><br />He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
<br />and to his praises we shall always sing. 
<br />Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! 
<br />Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer 
<br />tiddly beer beer beer. 
<br /><br />The Curtis bar, the James' Pub, the Hole in the Wall as well 
<br />one thing you can be sure of, its Charlie's beer they sell 
<br />so all ye lads a lasses at eleven O'clock ye stop 
<br />for five short seconds, remember Charlie Mops 1 2 3 4 5 
<br /><br />He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
<br />and to his praises we shall always sing. 
<br />Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! 
<br />Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer 
<br />tiddly beer beer beer. 
<br /><br />A barrel of malt, a bushel of hops, you stir it around with a stick, 
<br />the kind of lubrication to make your engine tick. 
<br />40 pints of wallop a day will keep away the quacks. 
<br />Its only eight pence hapenny and one and six in tax, 1 2 3 4 5 
<br /><br />He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
<br />and to his praises we shall always sing. 
<br />Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer!

<br /><br />Moon so bright, night so fine
<br />Keep your heart here with mine
<br />Life's a dream we are dreaming
<br />Race the moon, catch the wind
<br />Ride the night to the end
<br />Seize the day, stand up for the light
<br /><br />I want to spend my lifetime loving you
<br />If that is all in life I ever do
<br /><br />Heroes rise, heroes fall
<br />Rise again, win it all
<br />In your heart, can't you feel the glory
<br />Through our joy, through our pain
<br />We can move worlds again
<br />Take my hand, dance with me
<br /><br />I want to spend my lifetime loving you
<br />If that is all in life I ever do
<br /><br />I will want nothing else to see me through
<br />If I can spend my lifetime loving you
<br />Though we know we will never come again
<br />Where there is love, life begins
<br />Over and over again
<br />Save the night, save the day
<br />Save the love, come what may
<br />Love is worth everything we pay
<br /><br />I want to spend my lifetime loving you
<br />If that is all in life I ever do
<br /><br />I want to spend my lifetime loving you
<br />If that is all in life I ever do
<br /><br />I will want nothing else to see me through

<br /> she wants to know if thay are good <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> or not
<br />  be honest plz
<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />What I can do
<br /><br />I will use everything in my power
<br /><br />Just to make everyone happy
<br /><br />For you I'll stop everything
<br /><br />That brings you pain
<br /><br />All he needs to do is ask
<br /><br />I wish he would have told me himself
<br /><br />In stead of being told by my friends
<br /><br />It hurt more then what happened
<br /><br />My friend was honest
<br /><br />She opened my eyes
<br /><br />I wish I relized sooner
<br /><br />That easing my pain I'll suck it up
<br /><br />I'll take my pain
<br /><br />Deal with it in other ways
<br /><br />As much as having this pain 
<br /><br />When I heard that all I was doing
<br /><br />Was giving you a reason to make my pain
<br /><br />Hearing that hurt more then anything
<br /><br />In my life at this point
<br /><br />You are important to me
<br /><br />I won't let anything harm you
<br /><br />As long as its in my control
<br /><br />you are my safety blanket
<br /><br />As long as your at my side
<br /><br />I will always smile when I see you
<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />The Pounding Of The Heart
<br />True inside
<br />Blood moves in and out
<br />Hiden in the Chest 
<br />Covered with muscles
<br />Veins surround it
<br />Tubes go in and out 
<br />Flowing of cells
<br />Filled with each lub
<br />When the time comes for everyone
<br />The beat slows
<br />They run out of breath
<br />Their skin gets cold 
<br />The seconds pass
<br />In flash pass
<br />There gone
<br />With one last look
<br />There eyes close
<br />Only to say goodbye
<br />To the world
