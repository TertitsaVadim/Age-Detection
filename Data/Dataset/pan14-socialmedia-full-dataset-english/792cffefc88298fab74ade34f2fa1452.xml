<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Ok...let me take the blind fold off.
<br /><br />- Girl:

<br /><br />He takes it off her and she opens her eyes and sees the view of the city and at that same spot...that's where he first asked her to be his girlfriend....
<br /><br />- Girl:

<br /><br />- Boy:
<br />Why are you crying?
<br /><br />- Girl:
<br />This is where you first asked me out...
<br /><br />- Boy:

		<document id="94baad621cad4f4ea3cf8b55ff7beda4" url=""><![CDATA[Guys point of View....<br/><br/>GUYS POINT OF VIEW:
<br /><br />you might agree with it, but when it actually
<br />happens 99% of girls dont realize it 'til it is too late and that guy who did it is so frustrated that he has moved on to someone who will take notice.
<br /><br />From a guys point of view:
<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />let us pay for you!
<br /><br />dont &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no
<br /><br />one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hott Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Jesse McCartney is in front of us.
<br /><br />It's boring, and we don't care. You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough:if you aren't being treated right by a guy, dont't wait for him to change.ditch his sorry,disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your
<br />lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repost this
<br /><br />*Holdin Hands
<br />Girls :If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of
<br />times.
<br />Guys : Grab it if it happens more than once.
<br /><br />*Cuddling
<br />Girls : When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold
<br />Guys : Automatically move closer to her.
<br /><br />*Movies
<br />Girls : During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
<br />Guys : Lift her chin up and kiss her.
<br /><br />*Loving each other
<br /><br />Guys : When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her
<br />too... And mean it.
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars
<br /><br />Girls : When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
<br />Guys : Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.
