SOMEONE REVIEWED!!!!!!! SOMEONE OTHER THAN MY ANNOYING SPLIT PERSONALITY!!!! I just had to write another passage in praise!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU SIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I also wanted to write my first dream in a long time as my literary thing before I forgot. 
<br /><br />I was being operated on in surgery to check if there was anything wrong with my stomach. However, they forgot to sew me back up. The rip was composed of three lines. Two were parallel, and the third was perpendicular to the two by connecting them in the middle. Basically, it made an H. I went into the bathroom at my house and checked it out in the mirror. My guts kept spilling out, but not by much, and it only required a single hand to keep my stomach from falling out. I was able to see my organs, including my intestines, stomach, bladder and etc. One of my organs had a white spot on it. I was more concerned with how painful it was. So I went to my mother and said, &quot; Oh come on mom! Drive me back to the hospital already so I can get this sued back up,&quot; She said that she was too tired, let her rest for a bit, then she'll drive me. Then before I could do anything else, I woke up. For the rest of the day, I kept clutching my stomach just in case. This dream was NOT A NIGHTMARE. The most difficult emotion I felt in this dream was annoyance, and uncomfortableness. It was nothing like my first remembered nightmare.  In that, I had just moved into my new house, and I dreamt that there were ghosts in the basement. I dreamt that the dad and bro in my family were on some kind of outing, and that my mother, grandmother, and sister were all hanged up on the wall and dripping blood. They were all dead. The ghosts kept whispering to me something that I can't remember anymore, but I don't think it was Get Out. This was when I was four or five.

But seriously, I've been accused of being a lesbian (No offense, but this is offensive to me because people assume my sexual orientation because I've sworn off dating until I'm old enough. I hate my generation, they are to 'loose') had racial discrimination, and familal relations are strained, perhaps nonexistant. So I'm just going to right a literature thingy and kill someone by charging them, grabbing their neck, strangling a bit, grinning madly, then dig in nails so that I draw blood, feel my bloodlust increase, then go for the front and rip out the top part of their esophagus! see ya!
<br /><br />Perception is reality.

<br /><br />I hate you, you hate me, 
<br />we'll never live in harmony,
<br />so with a click, bang, bang,
<br />a shot in the head, 
<br />now we've all~ fallen dead.
<br /><br />You should know the tune to sing this too, if not, then you had a poor childhood.

<br /><br />Once upon a time, there were two countries. One was seemingly happy, though filled with much corruption, and the other simply unhappy and also filled with corruption. One day, a man from the completely sad country traveled to the other happy country, and was amazed at the seemingly wonderful country. So to heal his own country, he decided to copy the other country's history to cause his country to be the imaginary happy country he saw. However, the other country's history was wraught with pain and suffering, and so the man did such and caused the other country to collapse on itself. For once it began fighting each other did it truly crumble into despair. And the other country continued it's corrupt existence until one day, it destroyed itself, and then there was nothing. 
<br /><br />Well, don't mind it if you do not want to, but my split personality seems to like it. Wish it would like me too.....

<br /><br />the meaning of family: inside of us is the potential for maternal or paternal feelings. once they have been activated and have connected with being they consider their own, has a family been made. 
<br /><br />and well, a bit impersonal, but i gotta go to sleep, so tired!

<br /><br />Once upon a time, there was A lonely King. He way kind and just, but never felt loved. So one day, he thought, that he will do the opposite of what he was, for noone loved him anyway. The people, never loving the king but being gracious to him, hated him instead, and suddenly he was lonelier them ever. so he threw off his crown and jumped into a deep river. No one knows where the king was swept to, and if he got out. but somehow, those who knew him enough, knew that he was somewhere he coud be loved.
<br /><br />to da. Gotta go to bed, has a hidden meaning, see if you can find what this story represents! see ya!

I know you're all disapointed, except you split personality who is always trying to take my body....not that I mind. Which brings me to a point. Is it so bad to have another personality who will please everyone while the real you hides away the truths we in daily life always try to hide? Of course, maybe I'm making up my split personality and am really just struggling with life and myself.... oh forget it, while I&quot;m in control, I'll continue to write my literary whatevers!
<br /><br />In the stony silence did everything become clear.
<br /><br />Take the burning passion for your own, but let it not burn you and to lose yourself in the flame.
<br /><br />There! Two literary thingys! An apology for a rushed blog message, not that anyone cares, not even my split personality -_-;. Gotta go, See ya!

At least I'm suffering with others....I hope.....So I&quot;m just a little bit sadistic. ANyway, I really got to get to sleep, but I'm trying to be dedicated, so I'll make today's literary insanity thing quick....
<br /><br />The slowest of waters make the biggest changes, the only difference is that we don't mind as much.
<br /><br />Sucks, but I'm tired. less than 10 hours of sleep is equivalent to a drunk. or something, or was it just on the road? Aw forget it. Night split personality, who is probably my only reader! (Well i'd know if you'd just review...geez)

Sorry my loyal fans (composed of me and my split personality)I had this retreat because I'm Catholic (And TRYING to be proud of it, sorry god, humans are miserable, but you are the greatest and more!) and then I had to go to some lame math program (Math...must destroy that when I destroy the world) and then I watched a movie at the theatre called ..... hold up, give me a minute.....Trying to remember....it's just one big blank....it was only a few hours ago....man I suck...WAIT I REMEMBER!....no, lost it again....wait! It was cheque! It was this french foreign movie, a mystery and pretty cool. It got an award, but I guess it's how you look at it. Anyway, there had to be subtitles, because there is no way in hell I could possibly learn french now (After Chinese, English, Spanish, Latin....) Thanks to all those Chinese movies so it was as if it was an actual English movie...Anyway, moving on I've got to write something literary again, so how about this....
<br /><br />And the wise man said, 'I know nothing except that I know nothing and that I don't know what will come next,'
<br /><br />Anyway, I got to go, and just to talk a bit about the sentence above, I always hear, I don't know anything and that I will die...well no one knows what death really is..they say that it's just when you stop living (xux), but is this really living. for all we know this is all a dream which we wake up from) So I'm thinking unless you're a seer, which is highly unlikely (At least not a conscious one like me) then this really does apply to this world. So see ya! (or not &gt;-&lt;<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />

I have decided that I'll write dreams i have but they won't be continued unless I dream of them or actually have the will to continue them. What can I say, I have the sin of sloth! And the sin of envy, the sin of wrath, the sin of pride, the sin of gluttony, the sin of greed, and the sin of ...... actually, I don't really think I've had that. And maybe not the sin of gluttony, but I do think I eat entirely to greedy....Anyway, I suppose I must write my literature of the day.... Wellll....just something small....
<br /><br />The regrets of the past only know the past and cannot see the future. 
<br /><br />Well that might be wrong....darn it I&quot;m still thinking on it! Alright, I'll give my hand at something else alright!
<br /><br />Hope goes hand in hand with despair. 
<br /><br />Well I give up...I'll try again soon, but for now just ready my horrible ones. In the meanwhile, I'll read fanfiction and waste my life while hoping it will end.

		<document id="a34c6b3f22f727672c97c3109864d69a" url=""><![CDATA[fourth day and still burning!<br/><br/>Well.... yesterday's post was depressing. I was so tired today that I couldn't even concentrate. And I got this horrible feeling in my stomach that was a cross between hunger pains(even though I had eaten) and the knive feeling (When you feel like you have knives stuck in your stomach) So I'm just hanging around and such. I suppose I have to post something literature today, don't I? Well how about this....
<br /><br />We are all chained with the manacles of society, yet inwardly we weep and cry for freedom while putting on our stone faces. 
<br /><br />Ok...that needs a little work. I'm better with art anyway.... :sigh: I'm just not going anywhere now a days. so how about a little inspiration Lord? Relating to Lord, how about I tell you about my dream instead....after all, I can't very well leave my readers hanging can I? :sniggers: (For my other, split personality, that was a joke)
<br /><br />On June 6, 2006, a great feeling of depression hung over everyone's mind. One girl, a high school student around the age of 15, slept on her bus as she went to school. Suddenly, at 7:06, her eyes snapped open and she began to scream. The other passengers on the bus covered their ears as a feeling of dread came to their stomachs. The driver himself swerved off the road as he listened to the girl's screams. The girl herself started tearing at her clothes, as if a great pain laid under it, and soon her shirt came off. Soon, the apparent reason for her pain was obvious. great wings with an expanse of 3 yards each spread out from her back. The pure white feathers drifted around her as she continued to convulse standing. Then she suddenly became rigid and looked up. Her mouth opened once again as if her screaming would once again return, but what came out of her mouth was a huge blast of light. Around the world came seven more bursts of light. Together, they connected and formed a giant circle which never stayed. When the light from her mouth faded away, the girl collapsed back into her seat. No one on the bus moved. A friend flinched as if she would attempt to touch the angel, but suddenly the angel came back to life. She climbed a top the seats and flew out the hole she had made with the burst of light. Before leaving, she stopped and said to the people of the bus, &quot;Someone has to tell the school I'm not coming today,&quot; and flew off into the bright sky being illuminated by the circle of light. 
<br /><br />And that's just part one. I got this whole story worked out. So tune in for next week! (Oh, and split personality, that was another joke. And because you're socially deficit, the joke is that no one is coming to read except you!)

And other than that, my blood thirst has somewhat returned. Now allow me to describe how a little bit of bloodthirst feels.
<br /><br />I walk down the hall in a hurried fashion. People pass my way in the opposite direction but I give no notice. That is until I see him walking nearby in front of me. Do not mistake him in anyway as a crush. Rather, he has incited my anger through various travesties. As he is diagonally of me, my point of view can see his entire portfolio. Then a familiar emotion overcomes me. The adrenaline bursts through my veins for no apparent reason, but a haunting voice echoes through my head. 'Kill, kill, kill, maim, torture, kill,' His neck looks so appetizing. I can already imagine in my head the sweet life that flows through his veins staining my face with crimson glory. A sort of giddiness now enters my body with these vengeful thoughts of violence. I almost reach forward to take his life and his throat and forever silence his foolish babble. And then I reach my destination and my target walks out of sight, mindless of what might have happened to him if I were not in such control of my actions. 
<br /><br />And there you have it! My bloodlust. :sigh: It only gets worse after this. Oh by the way, how's my writing? according to everybody...I suck, and since English is my half language (Since I learned chinese first or was it English...i think I learned both at the same time, hence I suck at both languages and am unable to communicate my thoughts well) I must practice, practice, practice! Oh I hate that line!

Second day and I'm still<br/><br/>So I'm still writing things in my blog...amazing (for me of course) I have horrible memory. and horrible hearing...and horrible eye sight... wow, I'm not that useful! ^-^; Today was miserable, but at least my bloodlust hasn't returned. When it does, you will all know....woooooooooooo....that was supposed to be mysterious....drat.... anywho, to latest news, I have decided that I will write various items of literature in this 'blog' For example...
<br /><br />A silenced river cannot leave its mark on the world, and therefore has become obsolete.
<br /><br />Think, mull, bash your brains in, or just laugh. Anyway, I'll try to remember to do tomorrow!

Oh rest assured, reading this might boost self-esteem. After all, my grades are low, I've been kicked out of various programs, I have depression which I refuse to acknowledge even though I know I have it (it's a paradox, so sue me) and I have an incredible urge to kill myself. Of course, don't tell anyone...I don't want to go back to the awfully white place...Wait, did I say that! No I didn't....anywho, Feel free to flame me because I know this already sucked! WOO HOO!
