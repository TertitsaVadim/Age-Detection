Jiming Temple, the way we must pass that we go to Taicheng, when we passed jiming Temple door, I inadvertently saw the tower in jiming Temple within stands in the blue sky, white clouds set off  the reflection of extraordinarily beautiful upright.  Suddenly, I wanted to go inside and took alook in Jiming Temple, when I share this idea to dad, dad readily agreed.

<br />I am standing in front of the temple
<br />  We came to the Jiming Temple, the saw the temple is the hillside, we carefully from front hall to the rear careful visit, greeted by a temples, a respected Buddhist statue of exquisite and colorful, revealing the dignity and solemnity of religion. 
<br />   Dad told me that every has a dream, because of that, people started to faith religious. Actully, whatever Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam, their essence is the same, the difference is they use different language to talk about it.
<br />   I have growed in a country that full of Buddhism, so in contrast, I respect more about ‘dhyana’ theory, and I wish that I can realize more philosophy of life from it.
<br />   My view of Dhyana is a wisdom, a mentality, and a cup of tea that can make me calm. It lives everywhere, everytime, and everything, it live with us together I everyday’s life, like the shadow follow with us. It make us realized that we need to learn a way to check ourselves, just look into your own heart not request out. There is no simple thing in our life, so we must do everything well, and we cannot have distracting thoughts. When you are having dinner you must only eatting, when you are sleeping, you may not think other things. Keep your nature state, when you taste tea, do dhyana from tea, and then through do dhyana to sentiment mind. Do everything sacredly.

<br />   At 11.30a.m Kevin and I meet in the front of the gate of the CIAO ITALIA. Ten minutes later, all the people were coming. We took photo together in front of the gate of the restaurant. The apperence of the restaurant is not very grandiose, it is very simple just like the other restaurants in China. However, the inside of it is so different from those Chinese restaurants . It is elegant but not leisure, the restaurant give people a feeling of peace, attracts people. When we sat near the long table, we started to read the menu,we also took a picture about it. After that, I order a Jie Vanni Pasta, an ice-cream, and we order three pizza and share them. We took pictures of food before we started to eat when food were delivering. I think Jie Vanni Pasta is extremely delicious. I didn't know why that many people not like Italia Food, but I think maybe everyone’s taste are different.
<br />   Only one thing didn’t satisfy me was the dishes’ prize. A paste actually need to paid ?78 ?I think we can’t often go to there. It is not very fit to students. However I still think I will go to this restaurant if I have chance even through there is a little expensive, because I think I spent an interesting day there.

<br />  My work is a quite easy one of all work I have done in the past. All I need to do is keep the gym’s clean before the game start and during the game, [pass the ice drink to player, sometimes, I will translate some words to help the foreign aids talk to other people, and pass the drinks to each player when the time-out. From the experience, I have make a good friendship with most of player in Jiangsu team. During the time I have also follow the coaches and players study some basketball skills, for example, when we battle, I can use my body condition to enter the inside lane, until to under of the basketry. Also, they taught me a lot about how to warm up and make people more flexible, and how  to decrease the probability to get hurt, all of them are very useful for me, and they are very kind, when the break, they also sit together talking, joking together. They are not only teammate on the stage, but good friends. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/111050655_14356540_37234641.jpg" />  <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/111050655_2309311_37234653.jpg" />
<br />  I always went the hotel which the players lived in the afternoon before they went to the gym, and have buffet with them together, then I followed the bus of the team to went to the gym to start my work. Always, at the same time, the coach will gave the tactics to players in the rest room, and I will follow the workers to check the clock above the backboard, and make sure not any non-stuff person in the infield. The game always start from 7 :30pm. I often stay in the field until 10:30 pm. That was not a long time, I always stay with team and sometimes talk with players which are breaking.

I will keep doing the work experience in the future although it will not needed for require, it is a funny work, I like it.
