<br /><br />The Clever Fisherman 
<br /><br />As King Parveez and Queen Shireen were sitting in their palace one day, a fisherman who was selling fresh fish was brought in front of them. King Parveez decided to buy a fish and gave  the fisherman 4000 dirham for it.
<br /><br />The fisherman was overjoyed. He thanked King Parveez and left.
<br /><br />Queen Shireen turned to her husband in anger and scolded him for paying so much for a fish. King Parveez let her have her say but said that the fish was purchased and that there was nothing that could be done about it.
<br /><br />However, the Queen was adamant and insisted that the fisherman be brought back.
<br /><br />&quot;We will ask the fisherman about the gender of the fish,&quot; she said. &quot;If he answers that it is female, we will say that we wanted a male fish and if his response is that it is male, we will say that we wanted a female fish! Either way, we will be able to return the fish and have our money back.&quot;
<br /><br />So the poor fisherman was called back and was asked the question.
<br /><br />Fortunately, he was clever enough not to be caught out.
<br /><br />He replied, &quot;The fish is neither male or female. It is neutral.&quot;
<br /><br />King Parveez was so impressed by the ingenuity of the man that he ordered a further 4000 dirham to be paid to him. The fisherman thanked the King again but as he was about to leave with the heavy bag of money, one of the coins fell onto the floor. The fisherman immediately bent down to look for the coin. Queen Shireen was already upset that the fisherman had been given 8000 dirham.
<br /><br />&quot;Look how miserly this man is!&quot; the Queen exclaimed. &quot;One coin has fallen out of his bag full of money and he searches for it instead of leaving it for some other poor servant to find.&quot;
<br /><br />The man heard this remark and said, &quot;O Queen, it is not out of miserliness that I search for the coin but rather because it had the picture of generous King Parveez on it. I would not tolerate anyone to cause dishonour to the King by treading on the coin.&quot;
<br /><br />The King was so happy with this response that he immediately called for another 4000 dirham to be given to the fisherman. When Queen Shireen saw all  this, she thought it was better to hold her tongue and let the man go with the 12000 dirham before the King decided to increase the amount again. (Lessons from Life)
<br /><br />Speech is an Art. If one knows what, when and how to talk  then such a person will be successful in life. &quot;The beauty of man is in the clarity of his tongue&quot;. (Kanzul-'Ummaal)
<br /><br />Imam Ali bin Abi Talib(A) has said,
<br />&quot;Your tongue is the translator of your intellect&quot;. (Bihar al-Anwaar)
<br /><br />In other words, a person's intellect and wisdom is recognized through his speech.

<br />Jannat-ul-Adan is the middle &amp;
<br />Jannat-ul- Firdous is on the highest. 
<br /><br />Those who love each other for the sake of Allah will get a pillar of Yaqoot, 
<br />On which there will be seventy thousand (70,000) rooms. 
<br />These will shine for the residents of Jannah as the sun shines for the residents of Duniya.
<br /><br />There will be rooms in Jannah in such a way that every room will have seventy thousand (70,000) dinning sheets. 
<br />On every dinning sheet 70,000 types of foods will be served.
<br />For their service 80,000 young boys will be moving around looking like beautiful scattered pearls.
<br /><br />One bunch of dates will be equal to the length of 12 arms.

<br />The stem of these plants will be made up of gold and silver. 
<br />There will also be gardens of grapes. The bunches of grapes will be very big.

<br /><br />Someone asked, ya Rasulullah (Sallalahu alaihi wasallam):  
<br />will it be sufficient for me and my family. It was answered, it will be sufficient for you and your whole tribe.
<br /><br />There will be four canals in every Jannah. 
<br /><br />1.  Water

<br />2.   Zanjabeel 
<br />3.   Tasneem
<br /><br />Qualities of People of Jannah 
<br /><br />In Jannah, height of every Mo' min, will be equal to the height of
<br /><br />Hazrat Adam (Alaihissalaam) 60 arms (90 feet).
<br />Beauty will be like that of Hazrat Yousuf (Alaihissalaam)
<br />Age of youth will be like that of Hazrat Esa (Alaihissalaam) 30-33 years).

<br /><br />NOTE: 
<br /><br />If a person makes Du'a for Jannah three times,
<br />Jannah requests Allah that O, Allah; make his entry into Jannah.
<br />And if a person makes Du'a for safety from Jahannum three times,
<br />The Jahannnum requests Allah that, O, Allah; save him from Jahannum.
<br /><br />Please pass on and may Allah grant the entire Ummah of Nabi sallalahu alayhi wasallam Jannat ul Firdous Ameen!

<br /><br />Above: 'The True Furqan' 
<br /><br />You Cant Ignore this, send it to as many muslims as u can. 
<br /><br />The new AMERICAN Quran: a dangerous trick A new Quran 
<br />is being distributed in Kuwait , titled 'The True 
<br />Furqan'. It is being described as the ayats of the 
<br />Shaytan and Al-Furqan weekly magazine has found out 
<br />that the two American printing companies;'Omega 2001' 
<br />and 'Wine Press' are involved in the publishing of 
<br />'The True Furqan', a book which has also been titled 
<br />'The 21st Century Quran'! It is over 366 pages and is 
<br />inboth the Arabic and English languages...it is being 
<br />distributed to our children in Kuwait in the private 
<br />English schools! The book contains 77 Surats, which 
<br />include Al-Fatiha, Al-Jana and Al-Injil. Instead of 
<br />Bismillah, each Surat begins with a longer vesion of 
<br />this incorporating the Christian belief of the three 
<br />spirits. 
<br /><br />And 
<br />this so called Quran opposes many Islamic 
<br />beliefs. in one of its ayats it describes having more 
<br />than one wife as fornication, divorce being 
<br />non-permissable and it uses a new system for the 
<br />sharing out of the will, opposing the current one. It 
<br />states that Jihad is HARAM. 
<br /><br />This book even goes as far as attacking Allah, 
<br />Subhanahu wa Tahala! 
<br /><br />All this is poisoning our children at approx. $3. 
<br /><br />Brothers and Sisters please make sure you forward this 
<br />email to as many people as possible so that we can 
<br />stop this dangerous trick. 
<br />Please tell everyone you know and may Allah reward 
<br />you.

<br /><br />Death, job loss, divorce, accidents, illness, aging, acts of violence, mental or physical health emergencies, and personal upheaval are all a part of life on this earth. We can wish it weren’t so, but this is a reality we cannot free ourselves from. In times of hardship and strife, it’s helpful to remember that we cannot control external forces or other people’s behavior. Things will happen. If you are in a time of grief or loss, please allow yourself adequate time to reflect and heal. Be kind to yourself without being indulgent or self-sacrificing. 
<br /><br />The following some practices and attitudes, I hope they will help you,
<br /><br />Accept reality. In the case of Lost of your love , or some one hurt you . , don’t spend too much time second guessing, fantasizing other outcomes, or wishing for what cannot be. In the case of some one left you alone or you lost your love , , hold onto and bless your cherished memories and moments of joy. Periodically sit down and review all of the things you still feel grateful for, despite your loss. Write them down on a sheet of paper. Add to your list. As you heal, keep the list handy; reread it often. 
<br /><br />give yourself whatever time you need to work through your sadness and pain, because you cannot escape it. Instead of asking why, help yourself accept what is. In time, explore how you can adjust to your new reality with as little anger, self-sacrifice, or bitterness as possible. This can be difficult, depending on the circumstances or scope of your loss. Be good to yourself and just do your best. 
<br /><br />Maintain your faith over time. Time, faith and healing will do their work. Hold onto your beliefs and values. It sounds like a cliché to be told that time heals when you’re in the throes of grief, but it is so true. Hope and optimism help us find our way through pain or despair. Though it doesn’t feel like at this moment, time is a powerful balm for the pain of loss.

<br />Poem by Sheikh Yusuf Estes
<br /><br />&quot;Ramadhan has finished and now Eid is here,
<br />It won't come back for another year.
<br />We'll miss the taraweeh and days of fast,
<br />Our friend Ramadhan is now a memory past.
<br /><br />The rewards were many and the blessings great,
<br />Friends and relations came early and late,
<br />We shared together in food and drink,
<br />We're sad it's over and it makes us think;
<br /><br />Now that the devil is unchained to run free,
<br />what should we do to combat his evil spree?
<br />He wants us to return to the ways of old,
<br />by lying, cheating and false stories told.
<br /><br />He keeps whispering his evil ideas in our ear,
<br />But there's something we can do, if Allah we fear,
<br />By fasting six days in Shawwal, it's clear,
<br />It's as though you fasted the ENTIRE YEAR.&quot;
<br />-- Sheik Yusuf
<br />May Allah accept your deeds for another year&quot;
<br />(Ameen.)
