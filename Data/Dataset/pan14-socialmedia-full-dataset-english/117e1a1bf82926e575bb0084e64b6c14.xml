<br />Now you can intellectually handle the situation. Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and O Schitt. 
<br />Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O Schitt, the owner of kneedeep N. Schitt, Inc. 
<br />In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt,Giva Schitt,Bull Schitt, and the twins, Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt. 
<br />Against her parents' wishes, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. 
<br />Noe Schitt later married Mr. Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt-Sherlock. 
<br />Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt and they produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.
<br />Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt were inseparable throughout their childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. 
<br />The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding. 
<br />The Schitt-Happens children are Dawg,Byrd, and Horse. 
<br />Bull Schitt, the prodigal son left home to tour the world, and recently returned from Italy with his new bride, Pisa Schitt.
<br />So now when someone says, &quot;you don't know Jack Schitt&quot;, you can correct them.

<br /><br />The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog. 
<br /><br />The war weary soldier asked, &quot;Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?&quot; 
<br /><br />The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, &quot;You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fife is using that seat?&quot; 
<br /><br />The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another&quot; trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog. 
<br /><br />Again he asked, &quot;Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired.&quot; 
<br /><br />The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, &quot;You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant. Imagine!&quot; 
<br /><br />The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. 
<br /><br />The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier. 
<br /><br />An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, &quot;You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your autos on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window.&quot;

It showed a guy on a bridge who was about to jump, obviously suicidal. &quot;I'll bet you $10 he'll jump,&quot; said the first guy. &quot;Bet you $10 he won't,&quot; said the second guy. 
<br /><br />Then, the guy on the television closed his eyes and threw himself off the bridge. The second guy hands the first guy the money. 
<br /><br />&quot;I can't take your money,&quot; said the first guy. &quot;I cheated you. The same story was on the five o'clock news.&quot; &quot;No, no. Take it,&quot; said the second guy. &quot;I saw the five o'clock news too. I just didn't think the guy was dumb enough to jump again!&quot;

The man decided, &quot;What the hell, I'll try it,&quot;He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.
<br /><br />He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, &quot;What?&quot; He heard, &quot;This is the police. What's going on down there?&quot; The man replied, &quot;I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted.&quot; Came the reply, &quot;Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.&quot;

<br /><br />The only reason I would take up jogging is so I could hear heavy breathing again.
<br /><br />I joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks. Haven't lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up?
<br /><br />I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing.
<br /><br />I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body.
<br /><br />I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.
<br /><br />I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them.
<br /><br />The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.
<br /><br />If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country.
