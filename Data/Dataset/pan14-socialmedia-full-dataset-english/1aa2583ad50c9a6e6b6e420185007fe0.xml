<br />I know sounds very confusing but you try having that happen thats even more confusing? 
<br />Why do men feel the need to be big strong and tough all the time i mean seaiously we are past the cave men days It is aok for yous to tell us when shit has gone bad and it is ok to admit you need to talk to people believe it or not some of us woemn out here can actually listen to you without getting on our brrom sticks and going mental at you!! 
<br />I demand honesty now none of this I'm mr oh so tough dont need your support shit!! I mean wtf!! 
<br />Relationships are supposed to be a mutual agreement and a joint effort in emotions and sharing that means good and bad times!! 
<br />I really just dont understand right now please guys comment and give me advice!!!!

<br />Well the saying goes you r are better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all... right?? 
<br />Well i have had the priveldge of loving 2 men with my whole heart only to have one that passed away and the other that turned out to be all lies and manipultions?? 
<br />So really is the hrut after two failed relationships and a shattered heart really worth the few moments of complete bliss i got with either of these men??
<br />No i think not.... To lose one to death is hard enough 
<br />but to try again and put it all out there and find out you were played for a fool and were inlove with someone who was alwyas looking to replace you with someone better?? 
<br />That pretty much knocks a girl totally off her game? 
<br />So many people are so desperate to be loved that they stay in something just because they are so scared of being alone and they stay there untill something better pop in there face and then the current gets the boot for no reason and taht poor person( me) is left there thinking wtf happened how did it all go to shit so fast when in reality it was fucked from day one as the person who booted you to the curb never loved ya you were just a time filler untill someone with a a prettier face more moeny a better car whatever it is they are looking for came along.... these sort of people are never going to be happy as they are always looking for the next best thing always searching for more and never seeing how much the women standing in front of them with tears streaming down her face actually loved them. Never really giving it an honest chance and never actually looking at this women as a potential for life just a temporary pit stop untill the next level up came along!!  so in the process they could be losing their only chance to be totally hapy with a women and shattering that womens heart into so many peices that never will all the peices be found and put back together.....

<br />I hold no hard feeling any more towards any ex just venting in general about things i realised and things that have hurt me over the past 3 years i guess..... 
<br />I am lucky i think i have met a man after 6 mnths of being single who is willing to take it slow and work through my issues with me and not push me into anything i am not ready for which is great!! 
<br />My problem is now i dont trust and am finding it very hard to elarn how to do that again 
<br />I am very suspicios and am turning into a control freak i think lol 
<br />but this guy is wonderful sexy and has all the attributes that i am looking for in a man so.. who knows maybe there will be 3 great loves in my life?

I personally am so over the stupid games people play the lies and the big noting their bums about SWEET FUCK ALL!! Wish you could skip that whole &quot;get to know you phase&quot; and get into getting to know the &quot;real&quot; person?? Anyone else relate? I am out of the game i dont play games but maybe i should so i can be like everyone else and i might get past that 1st date stage lmao!! 
<br />See ima bitch ok.... i have a child....I actually eat food (NOT FUCKING SALADS) I like cars and things that can get me dirty lol.. and i can drink better than most men...And i am not totally scary looking...... Now you would think that would be like semi appealing to men...APPARENTLY NOT! I dont plan to change either and i am not going to turn into a freaking girlie girl who does my hair and shops for clothes all day (YUCK)!!!!! 
<br />I quit this stupid game.....If i die alone at least i know i did it being myself and not a dirtly big lier or a faker!!!
<br />Dont you notice how people change after you date them for a while THATS BECAUSE THE FIRST PERSON YOU MEET is actually them just hiding all the imperfections and little irritating habits./....See i think if we just got past those annoying habits straight away things would be alot easier than everyone trying to keep up this stupid impression that they are fantastic and perfect!! NEVER ONCE HAVE I RAN TO THE BATHROOM AFTER SPENDING THE NIGHT WITH A GUY... Ok so i may have scared a few of them away that way LMFAO but hey you know what if you cant look at me with mess hair with makeup down my face and nasty first morning breath then kiss my bum bum cause the man i want to meet should think thats when i am the most sexy!!!! 
<br />EAT MY SHORTS IF YOU READ ALL OF THAT BABBLE YOUR A CHAMP!! LOL

Hardest thing i have ever had to do was pull my life together again and find a purpose to survive again!! people say your only 23 what would you know about love well i say i was prepared to stand in front of a gun for this person and when he got hurt or screwd over it hurt me to have to watch him go through it too...my heart used to flutter just by a look and he could make me loose my breath with a few simple words!! Yes sounds like a movie and yeop when i met him it was like everyone disappeard too!! I am serious no movie made up bullshit here thats how it was!! Things went wrong lives change and shit happens but still to be kicked i n the guts like i was and not expect it and then to have to rebuild your wntire life was definitely hard and for some reason no one understands that it has affected my judgement in men and has made me very scared to let myself go? I dont want to feel that level of hurt again or loss... honestly felt like part of me was missing for a while there... I dont know how to get past that fear of being heartbroken again and to let myself fall again... to get that giddy teenager feeling again... you all know what i am talking about there too!!! 
<br />So come on some ideas or sucsess stories would be fantastic?

To be happy the other person is happy yet to hate everything in your own life due to the fact you made so many mistakes and didnt realise it till it was too late to fix!!

Dont risk them for anything... b/f &amp; g/f come and go but a true friend will stand by yiou through everything! even when those partners are not around..they will be there with the tissues and the drinks and the ears giving you a shoulder to cry on!!! 
<br />Friends are sacred its rare now days to find a friend with true values and morals who cares!! alot of so called friends just stick around while you ahve money or something to give them when a real fiend will be there when your broke and got nothing to offer!! 
<br />remeber these points when your next put in the situation to chose between possible love or friendship...

<br />Is it possible to love 2 people the same? Like a women be in love with two different men 
<br />and a man be in love with 2 different women? 
<br />I Personaly think thats a load of shit and that its not love with either if you cant chose 
<br />I think if you love somone and i mean really love them there is never a choice you just know that they are for you? 
<br />Anyway answer my question and leave a comment of your opinion and your reasons why you think that 
<br />thanks heaps guys

Well i have another question is it possible to be head over heels in love with someone....then develope feelings for someone else that are deeply intense too.. not act on the feelings obviously if your with somone thats wrong!! but what do you do when this other person is stuck in your mind all the time?? Do you leave the person you would be prepared to give you life for if need be to explore these other feelings or do you ignore them?? Again not any personal experience here as i am single but i am curious now as to what other people would do if they were in that situation?? 
<br />cheers peoples <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Also do you believe in love at first sight?? Or is it lust? Is love something that grows or something that hits you like a tonne of bricks at some random moment?

<br />well its 10:20 pm and i am sitting here having a drink and bitching to my mate on the phone....
<br /><br />I am not sure why but men seem to think that casual sex and a relationship are the same thing?? 
<br /><br />I mean seriously dude there not hey 
<br /><br />Relationships are based on friendships and casual sex is just instant gratification that has no meaning? 
<br />Personaly dont see the point in that with a stranger...
<br />Look i am just in the mood to bitch about men lol 
<br />i mean if your just chasing the casual thing then say so dont lead a girl to believe youw ant more when you dont its pointless and a waste of both peoples time!! 
<br /><br />No i am not a resentful hurt women as i am happily single to be hoest i just think you men out there that bullshit to get laid seriously need to wake upi and realise that the things you do can hurt!! 
<br />yes i know there are men out there who are not like that but i really think you all need to get out of hiding and show yourselves to some of these stunning women out there who are chasing someone to just be with?? 
<br />have a think about it and feel free to comment on what i have  bitched about!!!<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

LOVE that havnt had a full nights sleep in many many nights!! Hope those little teeth are stopping for a while!!
<br />Been a boring sunday with many reflections of my last week!! 
<br />now just listening to some tunes watching my son ride around on his bike having a coffee and a smoke! 
<br />Cut my sons hair today OMG HES TOO CUTE NOW 
<br />Just need to put some gel in it to spike it up how cute!!
<br />In the last week Have lost a love yet gained a friendship Well not so much lost more like i let go! Friendship is more important than trying to force that someone to love you. 
<br />To let that go was probably one of the hardest things i have had to do !! 
<br />But the rewards of his friendship out way the rewards of our relationship!! 
<br />Am however not sure about getting back into the game just yet... I have tried to date and no one seems to measure up just yet? There was one guy but unfortuantely turned out he was unavailable.......
<br />Be careful girls with some of these men on the internet they lie cheat and steal to try and get your gear off!! 
<br />Am not a prude by any means but dont ask me for smutt talk dont try to hit me up for casual sex...cause that will never happen... 
<br />My needs are well and truely met right now without the complicated bullshit of a relationship!! 
<br />you want to get to know me and know who i am talking smutt is not going to make that happen now is it!1 
<br />i am a self assured women who is independant and certainly dont need a man in my life to &quot;complete&quot; it (another thing i have learnt this week) 
<br />The company is great but the bullshit that goes along with a relationship you really have to ask yourself is it worth it...for what the occasional feeling of satisfaction... sometimes feeling like its worth it and the rest of the time fighting with them over silly things that really dont matter. But you dont realise that untill its too late and insults out of anger have hurt and broken trust? 
<br />I am all for meeting mr right i am jsut becoming very skepitcal that he even exists?? 
<br />Hmm bit indepth for sundays i guess but these are the things you feel when you reflect back on the week i just had 
<br />sometimes you can have a neon sign that tells you what your doing is stupid.....but you dont learn from it untill you make the mistake and get hurt... The best mistakes are the ones we learn from and gain life experience out of!! 
<br />Luv yas 
<br />Kell 
<br />XOXOX
<br />To live life is to learn, to learn is a joy, to experience joy is to love, and to love is to live life.....See the circle O
