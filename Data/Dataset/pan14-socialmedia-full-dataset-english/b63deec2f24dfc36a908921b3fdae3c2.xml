Essentially, it will depend on your level of skill and confidence on which way is best. If you are not too confident, a 2D cake will be the best way to go. You'll get a great result and next time you will be ready to tackle something a little more complex.<br /><br />3D cakes are for the more experienced, although with careful planning even the novice home cake maker can produce a spectacular 3D cake.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;2D Car Cake&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />For a 2D car cake, you can simply buy or bake a cake slab and decorate it in a variety of ways. There are many different ways this could be done and some suggestions include:<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a car track (liquorice strips are good for this) and place cars etc around the track. Crush up some plain chocolate biscuits to make 'dirt', and mix desiccated coconut with green colouring to make grass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Select a particular car style or design and find a suitable image. Print the image out and draw an outline straight on to the top of the cake. Use coloured icing, lollies and candy to decorate the design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Make it super easy and buy some toy cars as toppers for the cake. Line them up on a race track or spread them around. There are lots of other great cake toppers and toys that could be used in this way to create the desired theme.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;3D Car Cake&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />While a 2D cake is a great place to start, building a 3D car cake is a lot of fun and well worth the little more effort it takes to build. To build a 3D cake, it is necessary to start with a cake slab and 'carve' and 'mould' the cake to a design.<br /><br />It is important to plan the design of the final cake before attempting to cut it out. This is to ensure there is enough cake to finish the job and also helps to make the whole process less stressful.<br /><br />Once the basic outline of the cake is built, it is necessary to ice and decorate the cake. It is a good idea to 'crumb coat' the cake first, which means applying a plain icing all over to keep the crumbs in check. Then, either butter cream or fondant icing can be used as required.<br /><br />It is possible to create the features for the cake in a variety of ways. First, simply use cake cut-offs to cut out extra features such as wheels, spoilers and antennae. Another option is to use biscuits (wheels), candy or other decorations to add features to the cake. And finally, fondant can be coloured and cut as required to add the finishing touches.<br /><br />It is a good idea when building a 3D car cake to also think about the cake board or stand. This can be decorated as well and an obvious addition for a car is some road, racing track or dirt (depending on the cake). Either way, you will have a sure winner with the boys.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXN0ZWQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvcmFuZGFsYmFydGxlMjQvYmxvZ3MvMzAwNDI2Lw__" target="_blank">Cooking Is Fun!

The reasons for this vary. For some people, the thought of purchasing health insurance never enters their minds. Others don't fully comprehend how it works or how important it is, and then there are those who simply don't have the money to buy a policy. With the information and advice you'll find below, you can make better health insurance decisions in the future.<br /><br />A group buying into an insurance plan is rewarded with reduced costs for its members. This is how employee plans work. But, what happens when you are self-employed? Consider joining associations for self-employed workers, like the Freelancers Union. Groups can offer affordable insurance, among other benefits to members.<br /><br />Make sure you choose a plan that covers any medications you currently take, as well as the basics, like antibiotics. The list changes yearly, so check when you re-enroll so that you won't be surprised when filling a prescription.<br /><br />When you change insurance policies, be sure to have the particulars on hand regarding your current plan. Know your premium amounts, the deductible on your policy and the types of expenses that will be covered once the deductible is paid. You should have these records and your current plan to compare to when searching for a different policy.<br /><br />If you can avoid it, stay away from using your credit card to pay for health insurance. You may discover that your health insurance provider may charge an administration fee for using a credit card, as well as charging you fifteen percent more.<br /><br />Research your particular situation thoroughly if you're attempting to purchase health insurance with a pre-existing health problem. Companies differ on the way they treat issues, such as your weight, smoking, or pre-existing conditions. To get a great price, research as much as possible.<br /><br />You may have a certain doctor you can't live without. In that case, you'll want to make sure your plan allows you to still use that doctor. You can ask you doctor if they are partnered with any specific insurance company to save you time.<br /><br />Health insurance has a lot of factors to consider, so you must be organized and prepared when choosing a policy. Keep these in mind when looking at different policies. Have your medical records in order so that the company will know about any pre-existing conditions and how that will effect your premiums. This will help you find the best insurance plan.<br /><br />If a company finds your information wasn't correct, it may deny your claim, drop your coverage, or prevent you from enrolling in the first place. These issues can be avoided if you carefully review your application form.<br /><br />Health insurance is among the most vital kinds of insurance one should have. With so many varieties of coverage and different policies available, it can be difficult to make sense of it all. However, the hints and tips you've been given can help you find the insurance that suits your needs.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/clintortega/blog/blogid=11573156" target="_blank">Important Health Insurance Information That Everyone Should Be Familiar With by Pemutih Gigi </a>

Let These Tips Help You<br/><br/>When you decide to shed weight, be mindful of products which claim they are miracles and offer guarantees of weight loss. Like anything else in life, you get out of weight loss what you put into it, so any product offering a quick fix should be avoided.<br /><br />&lt;img src=&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.static.flickr.com%2F8305%2F7919749728_ac783eebb5.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8305/7919749728_ac783eebb5.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;252&quot; style=&quot;padding:10px;&quot;/&gt;<br /><br />Once you get back from the grocery store, you should divide all of the food in small portion size containers. Use plastic bags and other plastic containers to store the pre-measured food. You can grab these for work, too.<br /><br />Wear comfortable shoes for working out. If you are going to be doing extra work outs you need to ensure that you have good shoes. This doesn't mean you have to spend hundreds of dollars on the fanciest shoes. Instead, focus on purchasing well-made shoes that fit comfortably and properly.<br /><br />If you are just beginning your weight loss journey, keeps things simple. Start by abandoning a single bad habit and gradually work on others. Ridding yourself completely of vices all at once can spell disaster.<br /><br />Cardio is a great way to shed those extra pounds quickly. Cardiovascular exercises lead to faster fat burning and an elevated heart rate. Any activity that gets your heart rate up and keeps it there qualifies as cardiovascular exercise, so pick something you find enjoyable and stick with it!<br /><br />Plan all of your meals at the beginning of the week to save money on groceries and ensure that you're eating healthily at every meal. Planning your meals in advance allows you to be more efficient in the kitchen.<br /><br />Start exercising when you want to lose weight. Go to the gym if you can find the time and afford it. Other options include Tai Chi, going for a walk or jog, or Pilates. Talk with your doctor prior to beginning any program if there is a chance you have any heath problems. You can do lots of exercises at your own home or during your day that will assist you in losing weight.<br /><br />One important part of losing weight is to never deny a food group. It is a bad idea to eliminate any group of food from the diet because your body needs fat, sodium and sugar in small quantities.
