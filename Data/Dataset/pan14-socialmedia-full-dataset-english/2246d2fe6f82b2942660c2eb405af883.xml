The wing suggestion of the larger aircraft was bent, though the scaled-down jet’s tail was crumpled and bent.<br /><br />The Federal Aviation Administration will support the NTSB on the investigation, FAA spokesman Jim Peters said.<br /><br />Investigators will critique the flight information and cockpit recorders in both jets and recordings of air traffic regulate conversations and floor radar. They also will interview crew members on each planes, review weather conditions at the time of the incident and perform bodily inspections of equally aircraft, Peters explained.<br /><br />The probe could involve drug and alcohol testing, he explained.<br /><br />The NTSB, Knudson explained, is anticipated to situation in ten days a preliminary report, which would not essentially level to a cause.<br /><br />The wing of Delta Flight 266, a Boeing 767 headed to Amsterdam, clipped the tail of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 4904, departing for Raleigh-Durham, N.C., at about seven:thirty p.m., Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter reported.

Kennedy Global Airport in New York in April, when the left wing of a significant Airbus A380 operated by Air France clipped a Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jet flown by Comair, spinning the scaled-down aircraft just about 90 degrees. No one particular was hurt.<br /><br />The JFK collision, on the other hand, is markedly distinct from the one at Logan. The New York collision occurred in the ramp exactly where departing and arriving aircraft are serviced by baggage handlers, catering workers, fueling personnel and other ramp employees. The accident in Boston occurred on the taxiway, which is viewed as part of the airfield and is beneath the command of air website traffic controllers.<br /><br />If you or somebody you know has had their safety compromised on a commercial or private plane, call the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalaviationlaw.com%2Fpractice-areas%2Fair-ambulance.phpat"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalaviationlaw.com/practice-areas/air-ambulance.phpat</a> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalaviationlaw.com%2Fabout-us%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalaviationlaw.com/about-us/</a>.
