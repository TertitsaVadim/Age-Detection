But now, there are many scraches on the screen which destory the style and fashion look of my cellphone. As we know, buy an new iphone 4 and all the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2JsYWNrLWFwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS00LWRpZ2l0aXplci1sY2QtYXNzZW1ibHktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">iphone 4 accessories</a>are huge invests which will cost a lot. So I try to find a free or affortable way to make it look as before.
<br /><br />We know that there is no free lunch in the world. So I just find the way through which I cost least to make it looks as before. 
<br />I will get a new iphone 4 through the several steps below.
<br /><br />Step 1 Open the iPhone 
<br />1) Take out two bottom screws (blue arrows)
<br />2) Use suction cup ( place it around the home button) and flip the glass up
<br />3) You will see connectors and numbers. Use the prying tool and lift the number one and number two connector. For the number three connector lift the flap and pull the screen away. ( Red arrows)
<br />You should take care of this step, or your iphone LCD Screen may be ruined.
<br /><br />Step 2 Remove LCD tray from Frame/Touchscreen 
<br />1) Remove the tape on the side of the LCD ( black)
<br />2) Remove the remaining screws ( blue) 
<br />3) Use a prying tool on the side of the LCD tray to lift the LCD slightly
<br />4) Once the lcd has been lifter slightly use that small little hole on the bottom to slide the LCD down. ( safest way to remove LCD) 
<br /><br />Step 3 Removing LCD 
<br />1) You will have to unstick your old LCD from the aluminum tray ( this will ruin your LCD, because the rear reflective material of the LCD will staty stuck to the LCD tray) 
<br />2) Remove old LCD reflective material (its like a mirror) and clean off the old adhesive
<br />3) Test fit the new LCD ( it lines up with two small plastic nibs and two holes on the LCD tray
<br />4) Remove the rear plastic from the new LCD, and stick it on the LCD tray ( you have to do this right the first step !) 
<br />5) When you are done use the old LCD as you template, and make small folds in the LCD cable connector ( you need it to be folded identically)
<br /><br />Step 4 Replac front glass 
<br />I didn't take many pictures because, well its a pretty simple thing procedure, that is very difficult to do correctly. It's like removing the aluminum foil from a Hershey's bar. It's easy to do, but in the process the aluminum foil gets a bit wrinkled 
<br />1) Heat up the Glass and Plastic frame ( I can't really say how long depending on what you use, but a good sign is if you start to smell a little bit of plastic, that's a good signt
<br />2) Someohow, either using your fingers or a prying tool, remove the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2JsYWNrLWFwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS00LWRpZ2l0aXplci1sY2QtYXNzZW1ibHktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">iphone 4 black screen</a>.This will probably crack the lcd, and actually that makes it a bit easier. I heard from a friend, that if you already have a cracked glass, removing it is a bit easier than trying to remove it as an entire piece.
<br />3) Clean off all the old residue, and if you bent your frame alittle, bend it back in to shape. 
<br />4) Apply the new adhesive strips (pretty easy) make sure that you when you buy the touchscreen/glass it comes with two new strips 
<br />5) Before you apply the touchscreen/glass put on some latex gloves (from now until you are finish) and peel the inside screen protector away a bit, and tape down the cables
<br />6)Remove the adhesive from the two strips and place the new glass on your plastic frame (take your time ) 
<br />Step 4 Put New LCD back in 
<br />7) Remove the inside screen protector of the Glass/touchscreen and put it glass side up (to avoid dust). Then remove the lcd screen protector and keep it in your hand (you want to avoid getting any dust on it ). Before you snap the new LCD into the frame, make sure there in no dust/lint on either part (used the compressed air before you put everything together, DON'T use the microfiber since they have lint) 
<br /><br />Step 5 Put everything back together 
<br />Just the reverse, pretty easy. Before you put the screws on the LCD tray, make sure you didn't get any dust, if you did unsnap the lcd, used the compressed air to get it clean and put it back together. Not a comprehensive guide ( sure you can find a video or guide online) but I posted these tips
<br />that I read from different users online, especially the ones that make things easier/lower risk of damaging your iPhone 4 LCD Screen Replacement.
<br /><br />Now the new iphone 4 is on your hands. Do you think it is easy? All you need to buy is the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2JsYWNrLWFwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS00LWRpZ2l0aXplci1sY2QtYXNzZW1ibHktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">iphone 4 screen</a> include Glass touch screen digitizer, LCD screen display with backlight, Surrounding black frame, which only cost your about $100.

<br /><br />According to reports, some one also pointed out that Apple has been sealed in resolving the bad camera sensor problem. In order to solve this problem, it may have to re-design iPhone 4.

<br /><br />Again Apple did not do what it’s competitors have done, they invented a new way to fuse the liquid crystal display to the Multi-Touch screen, therefore removing any possibility of air leaking into the gap between the two layers. This produced an effect as if the pixels are painted directly on the glass surface, having a superb viewing angle. This display also has the same IPS technology used in the Apple LED Cinema displays and iPad, as a result the screen has a 800:1 contrast ratio, producing the darkest darks and whitest whites. This brand new liquid crystal display technology has 4 times as many pixels compared to previous iPhone models, paceked inside the same 3.5? LED-backlit display, hence producing a display of 960 x 640 pixels display with 326 ppi pixel density.
<br /><br />iphone 4 Vs HTC
<br />Want to see what we’re speaking about? The above comparison shot arrives from Engadget and compares the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzLWZvci1pcGhvbmUtYzQ5MC5odG1s" target="_blank">iPhone 4’s Retina Display</a> with one of the previously cited industry bests, the HTC Evo 4G’s display.
<br />Granted, the HTC Evo 4G is throwing 38% much less pixels at the display than Apple, but even so: look at how those app icons are basically throbbing through the iPhone’s glass, while the Evo 4G’s display looks like it has been submerged in a thin layer of dirty water.
<br />You see the same effect when you compare it to the iPhone 3GS too.
<br />Incredible. This is the new standard for smartphone displays. Sadly, though, this means your brand new iPad is heading to look this muddy once you get an iPhone 4 in your hands too.
<br /><br />iphone 4 Vs Samsung
<br />Samsung seems to have taken exception to a little sidenote made by Steve Jobs during his iPhone 4 announcement at WWDC10 this Monday. While waxing poetic on the virtues of IPS, Jobs let us know that he considers it an entirely superior display technology to OLED, and now the world's biggest display maker has a handful of words to say about it. According to a Samsung spokesperson, the high-res retina display on the iPhone 4 offers only a 3 to 5 % advantage in sharpness over its own Galaxy S Super AMOLED screen, but sucks down a wasteful 30 % a lot more power.

LED-backlit display, hence producing a display of 960 x 640 pixels display with 326 ppi pixel density.
<br />Again Apple did not do what it’s competitors have done, they invented a new way to fuse the LCD to the Multi-Touch screen, therefore removing any possibility of air leaking into the gap between the two layers. This produced an effect as if the pixels are painted directly on the glass surface, with a superb viewing angle. [url=]Iphone 4 touch screen[/url] also has the same IPS technology used in the Apple LED Cinema displays and iPad, as a result the screen has a 800:1 contrast ratio, producing the darkest darks and whitest whites.If you read a lot of documents or images this Retina display will be perfect for that. Almost like looking at real printed paper or glossy printed photos.
<br /><br />iphone 4 Vs Samsung
<br />Samsung seems to have taken exception to a little sidenote made by Steve Jobs during his iPhone 4 announcement at WWDC10 this Monday. While waxing poetic on the virtues of IPS, Jobs let us know that he considers it an entirely superior display technology to OLED, and now the world's biggest display maker has a handful of words to say about it. According to a Samsung spokesperson, the high-res retina display on the iPhone 4 offers only a 3 to 5 % advantage in sharpness over its own Galaxy S Super AMOLED screen, but sucks down a wasteful 30 % a lot more power. Moreover, Samsung believes its screens offer better viewing angles and contrast, and concludes by saying that &quot;structurally, IPS liquid crystal display technology cannot catch up with AM-OLED display technology.&quot; And here we thought Samsung and Apple were getting along so well.
<br /><br />Iphone 4 touch screen Vs HTC
<br />Want to see what we’re speaking about? The above comparison shot arrives from Engadget and compares the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2FjY2Vzc29yaWVzLWZvci1pcGhvbmUtYzQ5MC5odG1s" target="_blank">iPhone 4’s Retina Display</a> with one of the previously cited industry bests, the HTC Evo 4G’s display.
<br />Granted, the HTC Evo 4G is throwing 38% much less pixels at the display than Apple, but even so: look at how those app icons are basically throbbing through the iPhone’s glass, while the Evo 4G’s display looks like it has been submerged in a thin layer of dirty water.
<br /><br />You see the same effect when you compare it to the iPhone 3GS too.Incredible. This is the new standard for smartphone displays. Sadly, though, this means your brand new iPad is heading to look this muddy once you get an iPhone 4 in your hands too.

There are so several reasons for the slid of shares of Apple Inc.
<br /><br />Even though Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4 today, which he claims offers over 100 new features, though he would focus on only a handful for the keynote. The iPhone 4 looks like the iPhone prototype obtained under questionable circumstances by Gizmodo: stainless steel casing, all-glass front, and a design Jobs describes as the thinnest smartphone on the planet: almost 25 percent thinner than the iPhone 3GS. Unlike previous iPhones, the iPhone 4 will have volume controls on the side of the phone along with an accessible microSIM tray. The iPhone 4 features a front-facing camera, and the back sports a microphone, 30pin connector for docking, and a speaker, while the top sports a second microphone for noise cancellation, sleep/wake button, and a headset input.
<br /><br />Consumer Reports said on Monday it could not recommend the iPhone 4 — which sold 1.7 million units worldwide in its first three days — after its tests confirmed concerns about signal loss when the device is held in a certain way.
<br /><br />“Consumer Reports is a well respected product reviewer, and the report should turn up the heat on Apple,” analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a client note. “Concerns around iPhone 4 reception do not appear to be impacting demand, but we think there are risks when a well respected product rating agency such as Consumer Reports issues an unfavorable report.
<br /><br />Consumer Reports, which publishes guides on everything from cars to TVs, said in its Monday report that it had also tested other phones — including the iPhone 3GS and Pre — and found none had the signal-loss problems of Apple’s latest iPhone.
<br /><br />Except previously known as the &quot;signal gate &quot;, the fragile screen became the focus of attention now.The iPhone 4 will also sport what Jobs described as a “retina display” with four times the pixel density of a typical [url=][iphone 4 LCD screen[/url] display at a whopping 326 pixels per inch—by far denser than anything else in the consumer electronics market. The iPhone OS automatically handles rendering text and controls at the higher resolution for the iPhone 4, so developers don’t need to do anything to update their applications to look good on the new display.But, of course, if developers want to add higher-resolution graphics to their apps, they will look stunning on the iPhone 4. 
<br /><br />However, the screen of the iphone 4 is easy to scratch and shatter. The report shows that only 4 months of purchase within the iPhone 4 users, which appears on the back or front of the broken glass, reached 3.9% failure rate is high, while the iPhone 3GS glass breakage rate was 2.1%, the former over the latter about 2 times. Most of the consumers have bought the [url=]iphone 4 back cover[/url] to prevent these. This article originate from the TOPONS.COM , please indicate the source if retweet, thanks very much!

		<document id="1a9d59e5d38b5a1742b56a38589f1bbb" url=""><![CDATA[New iphone 4 back cover launch in England this months<br/><br/>Earlier this month, CNET editor Josh Lowensohn posted about how Apple was reportedly getting some issues with the glass back within the iPhone 4, which was proving to be much less durable than some had hoped. Now several internet sites are detailing how you can replace the glass back of your iPhone four with a metal one.
<br /><br />Removing the back--or &quot;rear panel&quot; as Apple calls it--is fairly simple (see ifixit.com's tutorial). And in only a few mins you can swap in an inexpensive metal back for $50 from China. Other backs are available, but Unpluggd says that is among the few flat backs that's nicely beveled. (In the future, we expect to determine many a great deal more backs hit the market).
<br /><br />Of course, Apple does have some strict rules about messing with your iPhone and voiding the warranty, which means you may want to believe twice about changing the rear panel and just get a case. We also don't discover how a metal <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL29yaWdpbmFsLWlwaG9uZS00LWJhY2stY292ZXItYmxhY2stYW5kLXdoaXRlLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">iphone 4 back cover</a> would have an effect on reception, so let you know any experience with certainly one of these guys of me and others.
<br /><br />one iphone four customer named Steven ordered certainly one of these. He said that the back in the iPhone four arrives off so easily why not? if you ever need guarantee work you can just put it back on, you will maintain it in the box for safe storage.
<br /><br />Joyce do custom casework and interior finishes. Her iPhones have on a regular basis become completely covered in wood dust, stone dust, metal shavings, polyurethane overspray and all method of jobsite garbage. Chunky crap on a regular basis gets trapped in the case. Her iPhone four hasn't cracked or suffered a great deal more than a few slight scratches.
<br /><br />Every couple days I take it out in the case, shake it off, wipe it down, and very carefully dig the chunks of what ever out in the dock connector with a plastic material toothpic. after I'm achieved it essentially appears brand new. iPhones are tough as nails. I do identical kind of work, but you are braver than I am. I use an Otterbox for my iPhone 4, and it does work good. Of course, the downside will be the added size and heft, but the case arrives off simple enough. This article originate from the TOPONS.COM , please indicate the source if retweet, thanks very much!

Here are the three examples of them.
<br /><br />Nayan says:
<br />Iphone is a great product and people have spoken already. But glass breaking on new [url=]
<br />iphone 4 touch screen[/url] will be a reality. All Iphones used chemically hardened Aluminno silicate glass from Corning. Brand name is Corning Gorilla. Latest grade is slightly better than that used in previous but it wont prevent shattering on a face drop. “Windshield of high-speed trains and helicopters”, “20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic” and “comparable in strength to sapphire crystal” are all real and it was real even in Iphone 3GS. Common apple, compare and physical properties against your previous Iphones.
<br /><br />Truth says:
<br />Please drop an real iPhone 4 when they come out instead of an empty shell. I’m not saying it wont break but all this “test” tells us is that an empty shell _might_ break when dropped repeatedly. I just want to know what would really happen with a full iPhone 4. Then blend it…
<br />Why is this even news? People are retarded. Wait for the real test.
<br /><br />aleyska says:
<br />Steve Jobs’ iPhone 4 is a defective product. Jobs knows it is inferior. The signal-loss design flaw is significant. If everyone returns their iPhone 4 and/or refuses to buy them the design issues will be resolved — with a new design for example the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL3doaXRlLWFwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS00LWRpZ2l0aXplci1sY2QtYXNzZW1ibHktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">iphone 4 white screen</a>. Jobs has proven to be nothing more than a snake oil salesman ignoring the fact the he was unable to introduce the iP4 himself at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference because he, too, was holding the phone in a normal manner like you and I would and it wouldn’t work. Imagine being a mobile case manufacturer with 100,000 cases in inventory and no iPhones will fit your case because of the cheap-fix bumper! Return your purchased iPhone 4 and when Jobs gets a few million of them stacked up on his desk he’ll fix the problem. Don’t you fanboys/girls let Apple get away with this serious manufacturing error.
<br /><br />We here do a small science experiment the other day with a number of our newest iPhone parts. I’m heading to go using a no on this one. Why may you ask? They do say that it is 30 occasions stronger than plastic, and there is a movie of it bending. Bending, yes. They do also think the fact that iPhone 3Gs Glass was stronger when that arrived out as well. It may bend more, but can it handle shock and sudden impact, that may be the true question. That is what causes 95% of glass shattering. Not because you bent the glass inside your pocket, not because you dropped it and it bent, but seriously because of sudden impact.
<br /><br />Land it flat on the ground, and it will smash. We have evidence. prior to i show you the evidence, I am heading to point out a style and design flaw which will bite them in the future. On the brand new iPhone, the glass basically sits on best of the aluminum frame. On the old iphone, it was recessed and protected with a chrome bezel.
<br /><br />We have a total iPhone 4(minus the circuit board), here at our shop and decided to perform a small drop test. This drop was performed from 3.5 ft up. thoughts you that these components are authentic apple parts. Laser etched and all. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3BvbnMuY29tL2JsYWNrLWFwcGxlLWlwaG9uZS00LWRpZ2l0aXplci1sY2QtYXNzZW1ibHktcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">iphone 4 black screen</a> do survive two drops, as expected, but on the 3rd drop there is a loud POP, and however again, shattered glass.
