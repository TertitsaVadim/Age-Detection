<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: ..WHO IS THIS!?!?!? 
<br /><br />crazy1 86ont worry.... ill take very good care of you... 
<br /><br />crazy1 86 had signed off. 
<br /><br />The girl was so scared she locked all her doors and windows. She made sure her room was secured. She wasn't sure if it was a joke or for real. She didn't know when he was going to come. The girl was so frightened she decided to sleep with her little sister. The girl dozed off quickly. 
<br /><br />Then she heard a knock on the window. The girl slowly walked to the window. It started knocking louder. The girl looked through the windows and saw nothing... just some of the tree branches. The girl went back to bed with her sister. The bed was wet and had a pretty horrid smell. Maybe her sister wet the bed... the girl checked and found blood everywhere. The girl panicked. She didn't know what to do. She ran and hid in the closet in case the killer was there for her. While looking through the cracks of the closet the girl saw a shadow. It was dark, so she couldn't figure out who it was. She started to get more frightened. The shadow crept closer to the closet. The girl closed her eyes as if it was a dream. Then suddenly he opened the closet door and pulled her out. 
<br /><br />Her parents found her dead the next morning. She was completely skinned and hanging in her sister's closet. The younger sister was also found skinned and dead. 
<br /><br />PART 2... 
<br /><br />Two years after the Smith sisters deaths, the parents had a baby boy. The girl's room became a guest room and the little sister's room where the murder took place became the baby's room. The baby grew up to be a successful kid. 
<br /><br />One night he was on the computer and received an instant message. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: Hey lil bro!!! 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: Who the eff is this? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: It's your big sis. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: I never had a sister. I'm an only child. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: This is some kinda joke, huh? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: Mom and dad never told you? 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I died 15 years ago with your other older sister. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: We were murdered in your room which was once my little sister's room. She was killed in bed when I was sleeping. I was killed in the closet and skinned to death. 
<br /><br />2seXay4u: Quit lying. I never had a sister. If I did my parents would have told me. Whatever. Your stupid. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: You don't believe me? Well if you wanna look in your closet floor. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I carved my name and the time and date I was being murdered. Then I carved my little sister's name. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: If you don't believe me little brother check the internet. Google on ''Smith sisters murdered anonymously''. 
<br /><br />h0tNsPiCy91: I gtg little brother. I love you and mom and dad soo much. I can't believe they kept us a secret from you. They should burn in hell. 
<br /><br />The boy checked the closet. He saw the carvings. Was it true? He surfed the internet and information was there about the anonymous murder in the house. The next morning the boy went downstairs. It was so quiet. Maybe his parents were sleeping. Hours later the boy found his parents in their closet skinned and hanged. Then he found more carvings on the ground. They said ''I TOLD YOU I WASN'T LYING LITTLE BROTHER, I LOVED MOM AND DAD.... BUT THEY KEPT ME A SECRET. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WELL I'M FREE FROM THIS COLD WORLD, I WON'T HURT YOU LIKE I HURT THEM. I LOVE YOU!&quot;

<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys. 
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off. 
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there. 
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls &gt;OR TEXTS&lt; you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned. 
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait 
<br />till the morning. 
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/ 
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it. 
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong. 
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you. 
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence. 
<br />Yeah, you can quote me. 
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in. 
<br /><br />let us pay for you! 
<br /><br />dont &quot;feel bad&quot; 
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it. 
<br /><br />It's expected. 
<br /><br />Smile and 
<br /><br />say &quot;thank you.&quot; 
<br /><br />Kiss us when no 
<br /><br />one's watching. 
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed. 
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us. 
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to 
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own. 
<br /><br />We like you for who you are and not what you are. 
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up 
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously. 
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it. 
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily. 
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible. 
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot; 
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me 
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of. 
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; ) 
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, dont wait for him to change. ditch his sorry, disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect 
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals. 
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your 
<br />lowest. 
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes. 
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel. 
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they're doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..and actually mean it. 
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance 
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree 
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute 
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repost this 
<br /><br />*Holdin Hands 
<br />Girls :If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of 
<br />times. 
<br />Guys : Grab it if it happens more than once. 
<br /><br />*Cuddling 
<br />Girls : When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold 
<br />Guys : Automatically move closer to her. 
<br /><br />*Movies 
<br />Girls : During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder 
<br />Guys : Lift her chin up and kiss her. 
<br /><br />*Loving each other 
<br />Guys : When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her 
<br />too... And mean it. 
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars 
<br />Girls : When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat 
<br />Guys : Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers. 
<br /><br />By 12 am tonight your one true love will realize how much they want you. 
<br /><br />Girls repost as written by a guy 
<br />Guys post as This is so True

<br /><br />When she pushes you or hits you like a dumb-ass cuz she thinks shes 
<br />stronger than you 
<br />Grab her and dont let go 
<br /><br />When she starts cursing at you trying to act all tough 
<br />Kiss her and tell her you love her 
<br /><br />When she's quiet 
<br />Ask her whats wrong 
<br /><br />When she ignores you 
<br />Give her your attention 
<br /><br />When she pulls away 
<br />Pull her back 
<br /><br />When you see her at her worst 
<br />Tell her she's beautiful 
<br /><br />When you see her start crying 
<br />Just hold her and don't say a word 
<br /><br />When you see her walking 
<br />Sneak up and hug her waist from behind 
<br /><br />When she's scared 
<br />Protect her 
<br /><br />When she steals your favorite hoodie

<br />she wants you to read it 
<br /><br />- Stay on the phone with her even if she's not saying anything 
<br /><br />- When she's mad hug her tight and don't let go 
<br /><br />- When she says she's ok don't believe it, talk with her because 10 yrs later she'll remember you
