<br /><br />It is almost as if there is a certain delight when media is talking about the fall in Facebooks share price post the IPO. Facebook has lost 18% from its IPO price of USD 38 in just three working days. Experts are saying that Facebook will never perform while others are blaming the underwriters. Investors who did not participate in the IPO have an I told you so smirk on their faces. However what is lost in all this noise on Facebooks IPO is that the company is a success story and everyone has a lot to learn from its rise to the top.

<br /><br />Euro will further weakenEuro will continue to weaken and is likely to go down to levels of EUR 1.15 against the USD, a fall of 8% from current levels. The reason the Euro will weaken is that economic conditions in the Eurozone will continue to deteriorate while worries on debt of Spain will weigh on the currency. The ECB (European Central Bank) will pump in more money through the LTRO (Long Term Refinancing Operation) leading to the markets being flooded with Euro liquidity, which has the effect of weakening the Euro.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestorsareidiots.com%2F2012%2F05%2Fhow-to-play-a-falling-euro%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://investorsareidiots.com/2012/05/how-to-play-a-falling-euro/</a>
