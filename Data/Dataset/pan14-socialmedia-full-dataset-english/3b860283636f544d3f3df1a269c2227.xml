<br /><br />TEXT: 1 PETER 1:4-16
<br /><br />KeyVerse: “But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation” (1 Peter 1:15).
<br /><br />A very wealthy man had many  children from many women. As he Iived a careless life with women, he accepted any woman that came with any child with the claim that he was the father as long as he could recall having an affair  with the woman. He could make some arrangements for the care of mother and child. As a result of this situation many women claimed to be married to him and brought many children to him claiming that they were his. 
<br />     However, the man had an ingenious plan for his inheritance. He prepared a will before his death. He was determined to have only his true children access to his estate after his death. He ordered that all those who claim to be his children must pass a DNA test that will confirm that they were his. Many failed the test and could not have part in his estate.
<br />     In God’s merciful dealings, everyone is able to call himself/herself a child of God. He allows His mercies to be enjoyed by all: His sunshines and rainfalls. As we experience life, good health, day and night and enjoy food and drinks and even pray, we all claim to be God’s children. But it is not so. It is not everyone that claims to be a child of God that indeed is. There is something that marks out God’s children: holiness. This identification mark cannot be counterfeited. There is no holy thief, adulterer or murderer or liar. 
<br />     In conduct, speech, thoughts and actions in public and private, all God’s should are required to be holy. All of God’s children must pass the holiness DNA test or face rejection at the gate of heaven. Holiness is God’s requirement for entering heaven. He says, “be ye holy as I am holy”.

<br /><br />TEXT: LEVITICUS 12:1-8
<br /><br />KeyVerse: “And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest” (Leviticus 12:6).
<br /><br />The necessity of being born  again lies in the fact that there is something wrong with our first birth.  The Psalmist captured this when he remarked that, “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me” (Psalm 51:5).
<br />     The ceremonial uncleanness associated with the birth of a child among the Jews, as found in our text, symbolises the pollution of sin into which we were born.  The Mosaic Law required that after the birth of a child a mother would be strictly separated for seven days (in the case of a male) and 14 days (in the case of a female). This was followed by a period of purification which spanned 32 days (for a male) and 64 days (for a female). During the purification period, the woman is separated from the sanctuary and forbidden to eat of the Passover, or peace-offerings, and for a priest’s wife, to eat of any thing that was holy to the Lord.
<br />     More relevant is the two-part sacrifice that is associated with the ritual. The first part is a lamb (pigeon for the poor) for a burnt offering – as thanksgiving to God for His mercy and expression of hope for more favour. Sin-offering required a turtle-dove or a young pigeon irrespective of the economic status of the offerer.
<br />     The sin-offering simply pointed to the offering up of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, by whose blood we have cleansing and redemption.  By the same token we are no longer separated from the eternal sanctuary of God nor forbidden to share in holy things.  Being born again is the condition for enjoying these benefits.  Your sin-nature has no alternative remedy, you must be born again.

<br /><br />TEXT: Leviticus 26:14-26
<br /><br />“And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins” (Leviticus 26:18).
<br /><br />We cannot but agree with the French playwright, Jean Baptiste Racine that, “crime, like virtue, has its degrees.” That is why societies have devised variety of ways of meting out punishments to wrongdoers.  It should be noted that evil-doing becomes more despicable when it is presumptuous and obstinate. Evil graduates from simple to complex. To arrest its progression, incremental punishment is applied.
<br /><br />This principle was highlighted in God’s warning to Israel in today’s text. God had given them series of precepts and expected obedience from them.  In earlier verses, they were promised great rewards if they obeyed.  On the other hand, He warned that disobedience would earn them miserable punishments. Thus, God gave them opportunity of informed choice by tabling before them possible causes of actions and their consequences. They were also to learn from this that their divine security  was conditioned on their continued obedience to God.
<br /><br />Observe the nature of the sin God pointed out here. It was bad enough for them to despise God’s word and rebel against Him. But it amounted to holding the Almighty in contempt to despise His correcting rod and measures aimed at bringing them back on track. God promised to step up their punishment seven-fold for such obstinacy until they repent and come back to Him.
<br /><br />We must be conscious that our security in Christ and all other blessings of redemption are conditioned on our continued walk with Him. It is equally true that the pressure of God’s chastisement on any erring Christian gets stronger the longer he tarries in error.  God’s design in all these, however, is not mere retribution but a means of nudging us to repentance and righteousness.

But there has been a remarkable decline in the spread of leprosy.  Advancement in medicine and upgrade of living conditions account for this positive development.  According to a BBC News report, in the past 20 years, 15 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. Increasingly, forced segregation of sufferers is also becoming unnecessary, especially in places where adequate treatments are available.  
<br />     Among the Jews of Bible times, leprosy was more than a disease – it was regarded as uncleanness.  In some cases, it was one of the most humiliating divine punishments, as the cases of Miriam, Gehazi and king Uzziah. The difficult task of diagnosing the condition at that time fell on the priest and not on a physician.  Our text records the rigorous procedure involved in making sure that similar skin problems were not mistaken for leprosy.  Once a symptom was suspected, it would be subjected to tests.  As there was no laboratory facilities then, simple tests of depth spread and disruption of skin were relied on.  If the test turned positive and is pronounced by the priest, the leprous person faced a traumatic experience which included stigma and isolation.
<br />     Today, we need no priest to diagnose any symptoms of spiritual leprosy, which is sin. We must constantly examine ourselves to be sure we are sin-free because sin will earn the sinner present and eternal separation from God. It is better for the sinner to settle his account while he is still alive. Christ’s blood can cleanse your heart from sin and guilt today.

In Greek mythology, for example, it was a woman, Pandora, who opened the forbidden box and brought plagues and unhappiness to mankind. Early Roman law described women as children, forever inferior to men. Early Christian theology supported these views.  
<br />     From our text, however, a true wife makes a man’s life nobler, better, grander, by the power of her love. The miracle happens as she clings to him in holy confidence and loving dependence. The wife inspires her husband with her courage, earnestness and beauty. She smoothens the rough edges in his life with her softness and clothes him with the gentler graces of refined and cultured character. While she yields to him and never disregards his God-ordained headship, she is really his queen.
<br />     The job of a mother can be overwhelming, requiring clarity, focus and grace to start anew when we fail. We need patience and bear in mind that slow-learning children will outgrow their childishness. 
<br />     The virtuous woman is regarded in scriptures as one who will be praised, whose prize is far above rubies, who is hardworking, prudent, a loving mother and one the entire family depends upon for proper care and nourishment. In  short, she is not merely a housewife, she is effectively the manager of the home. Let’s leave our womenfolk where God Himself, in His infinite wisdom, has placed them.

<br /><br />Who do you want to have around you on your graduation or matriculation day?  Herod celebrated his birthday in the company of Herodias and Salome. The event set in motion the beheading of John the Baptist to appease the bloodthirsty mother and daughter. The dance brought about the dreadful death. Salome was the dancer at Herod’s ceremony. She danced so well that Herod was completely carried away. He promised to give her anything she asked for and that was when the tragedy struck. Salome, after consultation with her mother, asked for the head of John the Baptist. 
<br /><br />On Herod’s big day, he killed a prophet because of his guests! What are you also planning to do on your next occasion? Who are you inviting? Who is coming to dance? What is your purpose on the day? Must you keep the day? Will everything that you are going to do on that day glorify God? Your big day should rather be like that of the King in Matthew 22 who had a ceremony for his son’s marriage. What a beautiful time it was sharing with the poor and homeless. It is my prayer that your next occasion will not be an opportunity for destroying souls but one for saving the lost.

He is not a steadfast companion. He can only be relied upon when things are going well. Anytime things turn bad, fair-weather friends will disappear.  Boys and girls who spend a lot of money in and out of school will have many fair-weather friends. As the book of Proverbs says, Wealth maketh many friends. Wealth is like exposed sugar that is bound to attract ants. You must be careful of insincere friends. An adage says: False friends are worse than open enemies.
<br /><br />Absalom was wealthy and he had many friends who advised him to do away with his father David. They led him to his death and then disappeared. Remember also the story that Jesus told about the prodigal son. Wealth gave him many friends. But when the money finished, his fair-weather friends vanished. In our world today there are many fair-weather comrades. It is your duty to relate with them with wisdom so you will not lose out in the end.
<br /><br />How can one deal with fair-weather friends? Easy! First, do everything in moderation. Don’t live big. Fair-weather pals are always attracted by a lavish lifestyle. Let people love you for who you are and not for how much money you have to give them. Secondly, live right. Honour God and be an aggressive Christian and fake people will draw back from following you. Remember, you don’t need them anyway. Thirdly, learn to save money. If you are lucky to have parents who are generous with the allowance they give you, learn not to give everything out to your friends. Friends come and go but your financial wisdom is yours. Money alone will not attract good friends into your life. So, play safe.

And if it will come at all then let it not be a serious one that will make one to study and work hard.  Examinations should be as easy as reading novels, or singing in class or playing at break time. But to sit down and work long hours, read far into the night, it should not be that serious! Contrary to our thinking, examination is real business. It means: Excitement. Get excited about the opportunities that the examination is bringing your way. Examination is an opportunity for you to get promoted to the next class. Xanadu. The word refers to an idyllic, beautiful place (usually imagined). You must dream of the success that will come your way, the honour you will receive and the good things daddy and mummy will say when you take your examination result home. Attitude. You will face the reality of the challenge and adjust your programme to accommodate the necessary changes you must make. You must create time to copy your notes and read them. Work on past questions etc. Motivation. Motivate yourself to work. No cross no crown. Wear the cross now so you can wear the crown later. Improvement. Improve everything about your study and work habits. Do not indulge yourself. Make no excuses. Work hard and improve your reading and study skills. Neaten. You want to put things in order. You want to tidy up your appearances and check your work. You want to put finishing touches to things around. Ability. You are in school and you have not known everything that you ought to know. But you are working hard on your ability to get better. Right? Time consciousness. You are watching how you are spending your time. Importunity. Never give up. Do not surrender. Keep on keeping on. Opportunity. This is the opportunity to prove to the whole world that you are better than before. Necessity. That is what your success is all about. It is a necessity. You must pass, otherwise how will you ever face your parents?

Posing as a government official  in 1925, he sent invitation to six scrap metal dealers to discuss a possible business deal. Citing a bloated cost of upkeep, he said the city could no longer maintain it and wanted to sell it for scrap. So, he sold the Eiffel Tower to one of the scrap metal dealers and took a train to Vienna with the suitcase full of cash. The buyer was too humiliated to complain to the police.
<br />     Zacchaeus was also that corrupt. He was a Jewish inhabitant of Jericho and a chief tax collector. He was hated by the Jews for over-taxing them and for supposedly being a traitor since he worked for the oppressive Roman Empire. 
<br />     But his encounter with Jesus brought change to his life and family. In his curiosity to see Jesus, Zacchaeus climbed up a tree. When Jesus later came into his house, he accepted Christ joyfully and restored the stolen wealth to their rightful owners. Jesus can still transform the life of every greedy, self-serving Zacchaeus today. 
<br />     God is ever merciful and will forgive all who repent of their evil deeds and receive Jesus as Saviour. The scripture affirms that today is the day of salvation. Part of God’s purpose in this story is for us to be inspired by Zacchaeus’ example of repentance backed up with restitution. Your claim to have repented will not be convincing if you do not return stolen goods to their rightful owners, payback just debts and apologise to those slandered.

It is amazing how the artists can capture the details of the human figure with such accuracy that makes their artworks look like real human beings. The facial features – eyes, nose and ears – are crafted with all the lines, contours and blemishes in place.  However, the sculpture remains an artwork and all its parts lack life and functionality.  They are simply ornamental.  
<br />     Some folks seem to possess ornamental eyes and ears for they have eyes to see, and see not and ears to hear, and hear not.  That was the case of the people of Judah among whom Prophet Ezekiel dwelt.  At this time, Jerusalem, their capital was under siege by the king of Babylon.  Some of the Jews had heeded the instruction of God’s prophet and willingly proceeded to exile in Babylon.  Some others, including King Zedekiah, proved obstinate and stayed behind but was unable to upturn the situation.  
<br />     Prophet Ezekiel, employed a variety of drama and parables to predict the approaching captivity of Judah while assuring the Jews in captivity that it would be worse for their brethren left as remnants in Judah than they who had already settled in foreign land. By demonstration, the prophet predicted, in particular, the flight, capture, captivity, and sufferings of Zedekiah and his followers who, though heard the prophecies but remained  ignorant and defiant. 
<br />     God’s grace is always sufficient for everyone. It’s our failure or unwillingness to make use of it that lets us down and lands us in trouble.

<br /><br />Freedom is a desirable experience for everyone. Possibilities abound for those who are truly free from any form of bondage. This is especially true of believers, Christian ministers, pastors, preachers and leaders. When believers and Christian servants are free, they are able to minister the same freedom to others. But if they are bound up, tied down and oppressed, it would be difficult to make positive impacts on others. The church and their ministry would suffer the attendant consequences. The Scripture reveals that some people had important positions in the economy of God but they were not free. Achan was in the great army of God that was poised to take the land of Canaan but he was not free from covetousness. Balaam was a reputable prophet and a confidant of Balaak, king of Moab but he was not free from covetousness and greed. Cain, first son to be born into this world was bound by the spirit of envy, jealousy and hatred. Demas, a companion of Paul, the apostle who had the privilege of working directly with this great apostle was not free. Felix, noble and excellent governor so-called, heard the gospel directly from the apostle Paul but could not break free from pride. Esau and Jacob were twin-brothers from Isaac; while Jacob was free Esau was not. Gideon, though a great military man that brought victory and success to Israel, he was not free from idolatry. Herod, a king in the Roman Empire and Ishmael, a descendant of Abraham were not left out from the evil bondage of self and Satan. Judas Iscariot walked and worked with Christ for three and a half years, partook of His miracles and maintained the bag, but he was not free. Though Korah, Dathan and Abiram were leaders at the time of Moses, they were deep in rebellion that eventually ruined their lives. Lot and his wife were not free from worldliness; Miriam was guilty of slander and talkativeness. Thomas was plagued by unbelief after he disputed with other disciples that Christ had appeared to them after His resurrection. Uzziah was full of pride and challenged the man of God; he became a leper till the day of his death. Zechariah was a priest under the old covenant but his unbelief in God’s ability to give him a child at old age got him into problem and he became dumb until the child was born. 
<br /><br />Greatness does not confer freedom on any individual. It is compulsory that the Christian minister or believer be free if he is going to be a true agent of salvation and deliverance to other people. It is when the pastor is free that the people under his care can be free. If the head is not free, the descendants are going to have the same problem. But when we are free, the Lord will be able to release us to do His will. Because Moses was free, he was able to execute the programme of God for the children of Israel. He led the nation out of Egyptian bondage through miracles, signs and wonders. Without total freedom, whatever successes we have will be short-lived. Everyone therefore must strife to be truly free to be able to excel for the Lord. 
<br /><br />1.  <strong>FREEDOM FROM THE BURDEN OF SIN</strong> 
<br />John 5:14; 8:11; 1 John 3:8,9; 5:18.
<br /><br />Christ came to set mankind free from the burden and bondage of sin. His whole life and ministry were devoted to setting men free from captivity to sin, self, sickness and Satan. If there is any form of freedom that men ought to pursue and possess, it is freedom from sin. “Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee” (John 5:14). Healing and other miracles are good but salvation or freedom from sin towers above them all; it is the greatest miracle ever. It is the first miracle God wants to accomplish in the life of every individual, minister or preacher because if members of the congregation are going to be born again and made free from the power of sin, their ministers or leaders must first be born again. Those still living in sin are not children of God. Jesus Christ was manifested so that He might deliver us from sin and destroy other works of the devil from our lives. 
<br /><br />2.  <strong>FREEDOM FROM THE BONDAGE OF SATAN</strong>
<br />1 Chronicles 21:1; Zechariah 3:3,4; 3:1; Luke 22:31.
<br /><br />If it is possible for the devil to have anyone and squeeze out the virtues in them, leaders and pastors would be his top choice. Adam and Eve were the crowns of God’s creation and the devil caused them to fall. David, the best of the kings of Israel could not escape his maleficence as he provoked him to number Israel and brought God’s anger and judgment upon the nation which led to the death of more than seventy thousand Israelites. Job also, a man of integrity, said to be perfect and upright in his generation was a target of the devil; he was attacked and afflicted. Even our Lord Jesus Christ was tempted by the devil after He had fasted for forty days and forty nights. As He was about starting His public ministry, the enemy schemed in order to derail Him. Satan would always desire the man at the top; if he is going to have anybody, he would go for the best. Christ forewarned Peter of Satan’s intent to possess and manipulate him. “And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat” (Luke 22:31). The reason Satan always wants to hold the minister or Christian in bondage is to hinder him from the great ministry ahead of him. Every minister, leader or Christian that would be successful in life and ministry and be a mighty instrument in God’s hand must be free from the bondage of Satan.
<br /><br />3.  <strong>FREEDOM FROM THE BITTERNESS IN YOUR SPIRIT</strong>
<br />Acts 8:21-23; Ezekiel 25:15.
<br /><br />Bitterness hurts the spirit. As long as it lurks in the heart, it brings hatred and disturbs the flow of God’s grace in our lives. Sometimes it manifests in form of Jonah’s attitude towards Nineveh. Jonah harboured bitterness against that city because they had done evil against Israel and, if they repented, they would not suffer the consequences of their wickedness. He waited for forty days to see what would become of Nineveh but the people repented and averted God’s wrath. He was angry. The spirit of bitterness would not allow him to rejoice in the repentance of the people of Nineveh. God knows the thoughts and intents of our hearts; therefore, He wants us to jettison the old hatred and bitterness against our neighbours, friends and acquaintances. Every Christian believer must pray to be purged from bitterness in the heart and seek God’s ultimate freedom. It is only then we would be totally free to serve God and impact other lives positively.

<br /><br />We live in an age when the once revered institution of marriage seems to be losing its lustre. Many marriages are now treated purely as a socio-economic contract. Others are lasting for shorter periods than ever before. Some people have even devised an escape from such problems. They either opt not to be married at all or agree to co-habit without any marital commitment. Some even mindlessly contravene God’s holy standard of one man, one wife. 
<br />     God does not just desire the marriage institution, but wants it to work. It is for this reason that He commands wives to submit themselves to their husbands. The reason is because the husband is the head of the family, as Jesus Christ is the head of the church, and Saviour of mankind. Just as the church must be subject to the Lord Jesus Christ so must the wife do to her husband. The husband is to love his wife with the same fervour as Christ loved and died for the church. In fact, the husband must love his wife as himself - nourishing, cherishing her in all things - and recognising that in marriage, both have become one flesh. Love from the husband must be reciprocated by reverence and honour from the wife. 
<br />     Problems arise in the family because spouses are not as selfless as the Lord commands. You must put aside your own selfish interests and seek your partner’s welfare. This is what brings harmony and increases love and respect in the family. There must be sacrificial love and submission for peace to reign. Do not undermine the leadership of your husband and his interests. The husband must love his wife as himself. Mutual love and care make both of you to attain the best level possible in life as one flesh.

<br />     God knew the state of their hearts and therefore warned them through Moses that they must not forget where they were coming from, and avoid worship of other gods. Were that to happen, they would attract God’s anger. He would cause severe suffering to come upon them. To avoid this, they must take His word to heart, remember it always, and allow it to moderate their lives.             The Israelites were required not only to keep God’s word, but teach their children continuously to remember God’s word and obey it. For effect, they should write the word down where they can read and remember it always. This is the only way the Lord will give them and their children long life, and bless them so much as to give them “the days of heaven upon the earth”.
<br />     Believers abide in the Lord by learning, internalizing and meditating on the word of God. You, as a believer will save yourself a lot of heartache, trouble, pain and bitter experiences in life by living according to His precepts. His expectations from you are easy to fulfill. The Lord is not a task master. He is meek and loving in nature. 
<br />     You must make up your mind that whatever it takes, you will never deviate from what the Lord commands, nor would you neglect to impress on your family the necessity of allowing our lives to be governed by God’s words. Indeed, therein lies your blessings.

Their sorrow, the direct consequence of their sins and rebellion against God’s word, was boundless. Yet, the prophet who personally witnessed it urged them to repent and rely on the sure mercies of God.
<br />     The nation of Israel had turned sin into a habit that appeared to give them immeasurable pleasure. Ceaselessly, the Lord warned them through His prophets and messengers. They would only repent by turning to God in the face of imminent danger or oppression in the hands of heathen enemy nations. Prophet Jeremiah fearlessly prophesied about their seventy-year captivity as a result of their sin but they never bothered.
<br />     The prophet in our text had felt personal sorrow over the tragedy of the destructions and the attendant sufferings of the people. However, he was quick to remember that God will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever. He told them that though they were in such sorrow, yet, it was of the Lord’s mercies they were not consumed.
<br />     There are many people who take God’s mercy for licence. They are quick to claim that if God did not approve of their sinful lifestyle, they would have been destroyed.  But they are ignorant of God’s attribute of long-suffering.  
<br />     Have you ever pondered on the magnitude of God’s mercy?  It is wise to ask for God’s mercy than wait for His judgment. There is danger in waiting until the door of mercy is shut. Repent and be reconciled unto the Lord.

The swelling throng of people in places of worship everywhere and the rate at which new churches are springing up and drawing new members attest to this. Due to various problems plaguing the world, more and more people are seeking solution. However, majority of these seekers go to churches not to sincerely seek the Lord, but to seek solution to their problems. Sadly also, many so-called preachers, instead of turning the people’s hearts to the Lord, turn them to themselves for selfish advantage.
<br />     As the Lord takes up a lamentation on the children of Israel in our text because of the calamities that have befallen them owing to their sins and backsliding, the Lord urges them to seek Him in true repentance as this is the only way out of their misfortune. 
<br />     This is the same message He is sending to myriads of seekers at the various places of worship and solution centers. This is why the wisest and simplest thing to do is to seek the Lord wholeheartedly. “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon” (Isaiah 55:7).
<br />     If you have sought out a church where you are now seeking solution to your problems and you have not really sought the Lord by turning away from all wicked and sinful ways, you have to take a step further to seek the Lord wholeheartedly. This is what the Lord wants you to do this moment. If you will seek Him now, you will find Him and once you’ve found Him, you have found all that you really need.

<br />Mark 16:15-20; Acts 1:8; John 3:1-7; 4:5-29
<br /><br />Personal evangelism is the person-to-person sharing of the gospel of Christ with sinners with the aim of leading them to salvation. The primary purpose of Christ coming into the world was to die for the salvation of man (John 3:14-18; 1 Timothy 1:15). He came to seek and to save the lost. He could not allow any other thing to becloud His vision of saving the lost. He came for that purpose and died for it (John 6:15; 19:37; 1 John 3:8). Christ preached to great multitudes who came from many regions to hear him (Luke 15:2; Matthew 4:23-25). He also used the personal evangelism strategy to reach individuals and families. He used different approaches to reach different people. (1) With Nicodemus Christ used a direct approach: “Ye must be born again” (John 3:1-7). (2) With the Samaritan woman, He used an indirect approach: “Give me to drink” (John 4:5-7). (3) With the woman caught in adultery by the Scribes and Pharisees, He used a situational approach (John 8:2-11). He applied the same approach with the informants who told Him of the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. “Jesus answering said unto them, “Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish” (Luke 13:1-3). Jesus reached out to His twelve disciples whom He called apostles through personal evangelism (John 1:29-51; Matthew 4:19-22; Luke 6:13). 
<br />	For a local church to grow, the members must go and preach the Word right where the sinners are. Many sinners do not go to church, therefore, the church must go out to meet them where they are: in their houses, offices, town or village square, civic centres, playgrounds, hospitals, prisons, schools and marketplaces (Acts 20:20; 17:16-31; 16:20-34). No other business should thrill the heart of a New Testament believer than personal evangelism. Winning the lost is a task that must be done; failure to carry it out carries great consequences.
<br /><br />1. 	<strong>CONSEQUENCES OF NEGLECTING PERSONAL EVANGELISM</strong>
<br />John 3:16-18,36; Ezekiel 3:17-21; 18:4; 33:1-16; Romans 1:14-16; Matthew 10:32,33; John 4:35-38; 9:4; 1 Corinthians 7:29-31.
<br /><br />Sinners cannot get saved without the preaching of the gospel. It is the soulwinner’s duty to preach to them. The implication of neglecting personal evangelism includes (1) the loss and waste of ripened harvest, (2) requirement of sinners’ blood from negligent soulwinners (Ezekiel 3:17-21; 33:1-16), (3) Christ being ashamed of Christians that neglect to witness (Mark 8:38), (4) loss of soulwinners’ reward  (Daniel 12:3; Proverbs 11:30), (5) spiritual decline and stunted growth of the local churches, and (6) delay in answer to prayer. The consequences of neglecting personal evangelism on the part of the sinners, the soulwinners and church are so great. Every believer must therefore wake up to this great responsibility. We must rise up to renew our first love for Christ (Revelation 2:1-5).
<br /><br />2.<strong> COMPELLING NECESSITY OF PERSONAL EVANGELISM</strong>
<br />1 Corinthians 9:16; Jeremiah 20:9; Matthew 9:36; John 9:4; Acts 4:20; 18:5; 20:22-24; Ezekiel 3:17-21; 2 Corinthians 5:11a; John 4:35; Romans 9:3; 10:1; 1 Corinthians 9:22; Psalm 90:12; Mark 5:18-20.
<br /><br />Personal evangelism is a compelling necessity for every believer. It is not the will of God that anyone should perish: He wants all men to be saved. The Lord Jesus Christ was not only involved in personal evangelism but also sent out His disciples to do so. They were to preach to every creature everywhere. Paul the apostle said, “For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”  (1 Corinthians 9:16). To him, souls are more valuable than any other thing in the world.
<br /><br />It is an obligation for every believer to personally bear witness of Christ and the task is urgent in view of (i) shortness of time, (ii) the brevity of life (Psalm 90:12; John 9:27-29), (iii) reality of eternal judgement of the lost (Psalm 9:17), and (iv) the need for believers to be free from the blood of all men (Ezekiel 3:17-21; 33:1-16). Concern for our loved ones,  members of our families, tribesmen, friends, co-workers and neighbours requires us to witness to them (Romans 9:3; 10:1). The vastness of the harvest field that is waiting for labourers should compel us to assist before they are wasted. 
<br /><br />3. 	<strong>COMMITMENT NEEDED FOR PERSONAL EVANGELISM</strong>
<br />Isaiah 6:5-8; John 9:4; Luke 4:43; John 18:37; 1 Corinthians 9:16; Acts 4:13-20; 19:15-19; 20:20-24; Romans 1:14-16; 2 Timothy 2:3,4; Psalm 126:5,6; 1 Corinthians 15:58.
<br /><br />Commitment is an act of devoting oneself entirely to a given cause until the goal is achieved. Personal evangelism requires individual commitment. Our Lord Jesus Christ was personally committed to it. He said, “I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work” (John 9:4). Believers must be determined to preach to all men till the end of their lives on earth. In spite of trials, hardship and afflictions, a soulwinner must never give up.
<br /><br />Every spiritual effort must be made in order to sustain the zeal and fire for personal evangelism. This could be done through constant praying, yielding to the promptings of the Spirit to preach, regular reading of literature and listening to messages on evangelism, making deliberate plan to preach the gospel everyday, and maintaining the freshness of the Spirit (Acts 8:23,24; 1 Timothy 4:13; Romans 10:17; Acts 17:17).

Churches too plan programmes around themselves, concentrating on how to improve the lot of their members. They seem to be enjoying their comfort zones and do not want anything that will disturb and disrupt their established and organized systems. They appear not to care about the untold millions outside. A few who appear to show interest are waiting for the sinners to come to them instead of going out to meet them. We really have missed it.
<br />     Jesus in our text, rebukes these disciples for failing to believe the news of His resurrection. Having purged their minds of this unbelief, He immediately charges them with the assignment that must be their preoccupation till the rest of their lives. They were not to sit in their comfort zones but go out and preach to every creature all over the world. He assures them that as they obey, His power would back them up with great signs and wonders.
<br />     We cannot be standing still and expect to see the world evangelized. The Lord’s command is ‘go out to where they are.’ We should not expect them to come to where we are. We must look for them everywhere they can be found. The good news is for every creature, and every creature cannot be reached by just remaining at one spot. If we must reach all, then we must go everywhere. In the process of preaching, some will believe and be saved, others will not. So, we must not be discouraged. 
<br />     We have the Lord’s promise of signs and wonders only as we go. We will not see signs and miracles if we remain where we are and refuse to preach the gospel message.
<br />     Every day presents us with a new opportunity to tell someone about the good news of salvation and to see the power of God in demonstration as He backs us up with signs following. As you see that opportunity today don’t let it slip by.
