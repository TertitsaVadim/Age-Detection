I'll miss her alright but it's been too long for her to hang around doing nothing while the world around her turned.
<br /> I'll miss how she worried so much when i was not in my best of health, how she giggled when i got my way out of messy moments, how excited she got when i planned dinner or lunch at home with her and some friends; but i worried when she doesn't have that happy face i'm used to...when she kept saying she felt she was left out... 
<br />now it's her turn to move and she's having a hard time facing it... i wish her the best out there. I hope she finds what she'd been looking for  and wish her the best and happiness. chiclet, take care!

Prohibited by her 'ex' to go out when he is not around....selfish, huh? anyway, after four long years of missing her company, knowing that she was just around, we were able to convince her and have a look see of the world outside the four walls of her room. after a year of constant company, having coffee everyday after work at the mall, unplanned cook-outs or just   meeting each other to check the 'uk' products or a few bottles of smlite, were back to not seeing her again for a while. But this time we're happy her. this time she's moving on to a better life and a better self. .....a few islands from here, it would take time for us to constantly be with her again. I'll call you, i said as i turned my back today and i never glance at her, cause i knew she was hurting and so was i......

Unexpectedly, after an hour of mingling around, i received a text message from a friend saying he was leaving for Israel. I felt that sting on the chest……..it was so unexpected.This past year we hardly had time to hang around, we were so busy, we didn’t notice time fly by so fast. I hadn’t even told him how grateful i was for the times he was there for me….( these times i have become hesitant on being open with my feelings, people seem to think you’re such a ‘kiss ass’ when you show or say nice things to a person. I guess, sincerity is hard to come by in some places) though we really don’t talk about a lot of things, i was always comfortable when he was around, so i have always presumed he knew how i felt.
<br /><br />I had to rush off to his best friend and show the text message. He said he would have known first and it was impossible. Well, everyone had been discussing about friends leaving. Some heading for the City and some out of the country. Anyway, I had to drop his name and mentioned he was leaving ,too. If he was better off than where he is now, he should go, cause if I was him, I would definitely do the same.
<br /><br />The more I thought about him leaving, the more i got sentimental, i know i would miss him somehow. I remember how he raised his eyebrow when his expectations were not kept to par; how he smiled when he was in his mischievous moods; and how he worked with passion and devotion, it was impressive; how he asked me,what was wrong, when i had eyebugs ……. ( he is the only one who does that to me); how he had that glow in his eyes, when everything was working out well, and that blank look when it was the opposite.
<br /><br />It was difficult for me to accept, i wanted to make sure, so i thought i should read the message again. this time, I took my time to read the text message slowly and scrolled down. A long blank space and a few periods, I was surprised and burst out laughing, it was a joke! The message further said, he was petitioned by the three kings!
<br /><br />Sometimes, we only realize the value of someone to us when they are about to leave or when they are gone. Make the best of memories. Live life like it is the last…….

After lunch, i ended up watching a japanese movie with a favorite companion. I dozed into cat naps in betweeen the movie, i didn't notice him leave. i recall him saying lets celebrate your birthday tomorrow....
<br />          i woke up lazily today. i curled and stretched in bed for a while. No work today, so i had no reason to rise and rush. I thought of how my birthday was.... After I was Greeted by my whole staff with the singing and cake eating, I hardly remember what consumed my day, running around and checking out things, there was a concert, a wedding, and cocktails after the concert. Oh well, it wasn't new at all. For since, i had started to work, concerts were always set on my birthday. It's fun and exciting. What's so nice is friends get to set different dates for my celebration and i end up celebrating several times.
<br />           After celebrations with friends,  today,i had been with family. This time a very quiet celebration over lunch, then strolling around in town then again an early dinner. 
<br />           it's just another day.............one can do these anytime these days. What makes it different is the intensity of the bonding we get into. the meaning of getting together and the memories we make along the way.......

I have been too busy stretching rest and work  only to realize, I had skipped on these little things that give me consolation at the end of the day.
<br />After work, I rushed  to change to my casual clothes and head for a coffee shop just to unwind and get to squeeze in time for my best friend. I should have that holiday hangover but I guess, this time the holidays had passed so quickly I hardly noticed it. Christmas isn't like the way it used to be. Carolers didn't frequent our doorsteps. I remember,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />during my childhood, carolers started the door to door singing as early as september. Unlike lately, it took just a few days before christmas day for singers to be at our doorstep….the meaning of christmas isn't the same either…the feeling so different.I wonder if most of the kids still believe in santa and get to have those gifts in the big socks or under the christmas tree. Those days, I remember, just after dinner my mother would send me and my brother to bed and promise to wake us up after midnight. At midnight, we would rush to open santa's gifts and enjoy our mallows roasting by the fire while the kitchen smelled of yummy food our mother prepared while we slept…ehmmmm…memories.our mother sure had time to do the things I can't now as a mother. I can't spend so much time on cooking, unless, I have to really take a leave and reserve time for my kid's special request to cook my special sukiyaki for dinner, my pizza or siopao for  snack and special pandesal for breakfast. …and that was a….a year ago? Cause now when a request pops like,  &quot;mom can we have pizza for snack time?&quot;the response&quot;okay, I'll get you your favorite on my way home.&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> It's a quick way to give their request ha?

Though at the time Camp John hay was exclusive, cars or people who went in should have a pass, I don’t know how my dad was able to get the privilege but I remember , the guards at the gate gave him a salute everytime we passed by.
<br />A few years ago, I heard an official say, “we’re going to make John Hay  better”…. Unfortunately, it was not true. I’ve seen those green tall trees, then, before “the promise”. You could smell Christmas anytime of the year, specially in the morning and at night …. BUT it never became better. I had not seen John hay greener and prettier. Instead, there were patches of land with no grass or trees…..it still does. it definitely isn’t more beautiful than when the Americans maintained it. We should deprive the Americans of our land but it turned out we were deprived of better environment clean and green. I remember jogging there early in the morning and ended having a good breakfast at nineteenth tee! Yummy extra big crispy bacon strips and soft and mouth watering pancakes…who couldn’t resist! Just a few steps from the place when your jogging and you’d think your shoes were enchanted, it would lead you right to a table and sit yourself viewing the very green golf course.
<br />Oh, I also went skating at Schneider hall and took a walk to mile-hi to have a pizza or play billiard. It was safe and clean too. I miss those times
<br />I was in an affair when Baguio City was announced to be the Cleanest City and greenest at the time, Baguio became a hall of famer too…. to our disappointment, today its different.Cleanest my ass now…. Garbage all over the city! 
<br />During my childhood, you could drop a cookie and won’t be scared of “just a minute” and popping it into one’s mouth…. A bit exaj, of course. But the city was really clean….what’s the next promise? Clean up! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> but it seems like everyone is moving on. A friend had said her goodbyes and will be moving to a nearby city.. 6 hours away by car. She said sometimes, we have to welcome blessings with a little pain on the side. she would be with her husband and children this time and clearly though it would be difficult to leave all her friends, she'll be happy there....we really didn't get that much time together, but i am glad to getting to know such a strong person .....
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> again, just a few days ago, someone had been leaving things and cleaning up her cabinets and drawers    making endorsements and instructions with books and documents,she's also leaving to be with her family. this time she says, she would be able to concentrate and  spend time , quality time with her kids. could she really have the time she expects to be with them..they've grown and already on their own. ... she regrets spending too much time at work and trying to catch up now with them.
<br /><br />sometimes in life, there are things we love to do but at the end regret for doing so...
<br />balancing what's really important, balancing our priorities, and balancing what we love, who we love and why we love....would take a lot of balancin to make sure the results are balanced enough .....

Hazel had left the country 7 years ago and cyrne had been busy with his own teenage ups and downs while I had been busy unmindful of the ticking hours and days, months that had drifted quickly to years....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> this time we made sure we would spend time to the minute we were together. flying off to davao was a good idea. Commuting by bus was different, couldn't make the stopovers we usually do, having coffee along the way and dropping by powder rooms every now and then. it was a quick trip, with one stopover. We slept throughout the road trip so we lazily had our 'short stop' with a stick of cigarette and a drink. As soon as we arrived in the main city. we had a breakfast and headed for the airport. this time it isn't that strict, we  passed through the airport staff in a jiffy.

I'm also shocked when I hear,&quot;what's your order?&quot; but correcting these have been repeated to people who understand what 1 + 1 is... i wonder why repeating the corrections have to be so often.
