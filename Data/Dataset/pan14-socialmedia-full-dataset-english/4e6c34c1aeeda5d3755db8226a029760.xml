<br />Well try lookin' through my eyes to see this reality.
<br />This place doesn't seem to be what I want it to be,
<br />Your eyes don't project what is really seen.
<br />Everyday I've wondered why I went through this shit,
<br />Everyone has a childhood, I guess i fuckin' missed it.
<br />I was paralised, by the dark, by these lies,
<br />But I bet you can look deep into your fathers eyes.
<br />My mind is rapped around these thoughts and fuckin' images,
<br />Of playin' doctor, then to be struck by an angry fist.
<br />I felt real hate, at the age of fuckin' seven,
<br />I was suicidal at the age of eleven.
<br />You can't scream, you can't hide, you can only fuckin' run,
<br />I used to have thoughts of pickin' up a fuckin' gun.
<br />I'd aim it at the temple of my insane, irate head,
<br />And I'd pull the trigger, than just takin this shit instead.
<br />I used to lie down and look up at the cealing,
<br />I'd notice a blood stain from when I was once was bleedng.
<br />A memory would come back, one I wanted to forget,
<br />It would fill me with rage, something I would regret!
<br />REGRET!!!
<br />REGRET!!!
<br />REGRET!!!
<br /><br />I HATE!!!
<br />The dark is slowly killing me.
<br />I HATE!!!
<br />The thought of life erodes me.
<br />I HATE!!!
<br />My memories are so intense ...
<br />DON'T SPEEK UNLESS YOU CAN IMPROVE THE SILENCE!!!
<br />LIES!!!
<br /><br />I can't look at my relfection in a mirror no more,
<br />Because the site of me reminds me of the pain in my core.
<br />I was once waiting for my own dejated life to end,
<br />But I desided not to to hide it or to start to pretend.
<br />That my life wasn't the same as the person next to me,
<br />All I've ever really wanted was to be truely free.
<br />I guess I have to adjust this life I've manifest,
<br />Even though I'm overcome with this feeling of strong detest!
<br />DETEST!!!
<br />DETEST!!!
<br />DETEST!!!
<br /><br />I HATE!!!
<br />The world comes down on me.
<br />I HATE!!!
<br />These lies that are overthrown on me.
<br />I HATE!!!
<br />My memories are so intense ...
<br />DON'T SPEEK UNLESS YOU CAN IMPROVE THE SILENCE!!!
<br />HATE!!!
<br /><br />DETEST!!!
<br />REGRET!!!
<br />DETEST!!!
<br />REGRET!!!

<br /><br />Justice shows a white flag,
<br />Through public eyes of distain.
<br />The force becomes a hate figure,
<br />And on the streets there's an impulse of pain.
<br />The dead walls around me start to bleed,
<br />And the sirens wont fade.
<br />No protection from this fear no more,
<br />The gun's choice has been made.
<br /><br />Criminal Law!
<br />Pass through the system.
<br />Conquered Justice!
<br />And their price has been paid.
<br /><br />No one on the streets today,
<br />The gangs are obsolete.
<br />Children dropped to the floor for nothing,
<br />The government not on it's feet.
<br />You pay a price,
<br />For being different in the open now.
<br />Gun crime on the streets increase,
<br />Provoked, we don't know how?
<br /><br />Criminal Law!
<br />Bullet sales are through the roof.
<br />Scared Government!
<br />But their denial still goes on.
<br /><br />Open your eyes you motha-fuckers!
<br />Innocent people die everyday.
<br />There's no respect for the youth no more,
<br />But still they ask why it went away.
<br />I don't get this fuckin' system,
<br />Why ... the system has failed.
<br />Killing will still pursue,
<br />They're judged but stil not jailed.
<br /><br />Criminal Law!
<br />If you don't respect yourself.
<br />Wasted Generation!
<br />How the fuck can you respect someone else!
<br />DON'T SAY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WARNED!!!

Its stupid, to have no real view of whats happening right in front of you isn't worth breathing for. We're just told what we like by a higher class of person, after wich we then have to follow.
<br />This is the reason people like me cannot walk on their own fuckin' area past 10 o'clock. Its the mentallity of pricks and wankers that are capable of killing 22 teenagers in this year alone, in London.
<br />Its the &quot;Acting tall in front of your mates so you don't look like a pussy&quot; stratgy that polutes this nation's once fine capital. I'm a target in my area, not just because I'm male and in my teens, but also because I'm a &quot;Grungie&quot;, because I listen to different music, and dress different, because I am different!This is pathetic. Since when does everyone have to think, talk and dress the same.
<br />But thats not the worst part. What does the government say, what does the media say, &quot;Put your phone away&quot; &quot;Don't listen to your mp3's with Ipod earphones, stick to the shitty cheap one&quot;.
<br />How 'bout this, No! If I wanna listen to my music with good earphone, I fuckin' will! If I wanna text in the streets at night with a nice phone, I fuckin' will! This is my right as a fuckin' human being! I shouldn't be told to put my phone away, or that the area I'm in isn't safe. I should be told that the police and the governmant have delt with the problam, and that its safe to walk through. Rather than tell ME what not to do, tell them to get the fuck out the area before they find them selfs behind bars.
<br />How 'bout that for a new fuckin' system!

<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Life Begins At Death</span>
<br />Death is not a dead end but a begginging.
<br />Life should not percieved with a simple ending.
<br />If people used their eyes and saw the life within them,
<br />Maybe a spark would light and fire swould stem.
<br /><br />Could you see past the lies, and the boundaries.
<br />Into the clear, no borders or facilities.
<br />An autopsy to search you, for causes of death.
<br />When really thier looking for your last breath.
<br /><br />Death is birth and birth is freedom,
<br />Your right to a chance for sanctuary and babylon.
<br />So look past the light and step into your skin,
<br />Open your eyes and see your forgiven sins.
<br /><br />Stop using death as the excuse for non belief,
<br />Fear and apprehensiveness, for what may lie ahead.
<br />Hold your head high and embrace your death its brief,
<br />You cant see clearly, while your living but dead.
<br /><br />Your life is but a school for what to expect,
<br />Dont be afraid for you are not the insect.
<br />You need not to be unwilling, just take a breath,
<br />A scream or a gasp makes no difference,
<br />Your death maybe horrific but life begins at death.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Reddended Eyes Of A Soldier From Hell</span>
<br />Grab your head and rip the hate out
<br />Tear the skin till the pain seeps out,
<br />Build it up till your skins crawls
<br />Now smash it down in a deadly brawl.
<br /><br />Born to torture your mind at will
<br />Blind with rage and pain it will kill
<br />Unrelentless with fury and hunger
<br />Eager to destroy you while you whimper.
<br /><br />Your hollow body a lifeless shell
<br />Breeding its horror born in hell,
<br />Raining carcasses astrew the floor
<br />Into the underworld it opens the door.
<br /><br />Reddened eyes see only hate
<br />Fueled by anger, makes you degenerate
<br />Engulfed by a pain unspeakably terrifying
<br />Screams your name, with opened wing.
<br /><br />Blackened are the angels that fly from hell
<br />Blood on their wings, ringing the bells,
<br />Reckoning is nigh for land dwellers above,
<br />Letting loose a sea of red doves
<br /><br />For the blood shall spill on the green, green grass
<br />The sea water, instead a field of glass,
<br />Repent for your sins and to heaven you will fly,
<br />Only to be dragged back down, to hell you are nigh.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">God Is Desire</span>
<br />Through these blind eyes i see,
<br />God staring down at me,
<br />Is it God or just my mind in me,
<br />Deceiving me, belittling me.
<br />Can this be for real,
<br />Is this deaths awaiting call,
<br />Is he coming for me,
<br />Seeking hunting me.
<br /><br />As i listen to this thing,
<br />Screaming away in my brain,
<br />Screaming of terrible pain,
<br />And things i cant explain.
<br />God is happy says he the thing,
<br />He loves your work,
<br />All the effort and time it took.
<br />To stand there and take a life,
<br />And be forgiven without a second look.
<br /><br />Does it know what ive done,
<br />Has it been following me,
<br />Can it be beside me,
<br />Watching and waiting for me.
<br />Take me now, i scream to him,
<br />End this game and forgive this sin,
<br />Is it so hard to repent for this.
<br />Murder so cold and effortlessly plain,
<br />No screaming or hurt, not even pain.
<br /><br />I wonder where he is,
<br />The man i told needed to be dealt with,
<br />So innocent and calm and easy to deal with.
<br />Will he forgive me,
<br />For the rage that consumed me,
<br />The hate i used to make him kneel before me.
<br /><br />Hate is what i used,
<br />And its hate that will end me,
<br />Such a simple emotion,
<br />Can end the life within me.
<br />For the gates of hatred are clad in iron,
<br />So strong and open to all that you desire.
<br />Hate is what fills you,
<br />Consumes the soul within you.
<br /><br />Its almosty like a magic trick,
<br />One second hes there,
<br />And the next hes lying in blood so thick.
<br />If this is all it takes just a curl of the finger,
<br />I'll stay insde make sure im not a ringer.
<br /><br />Cos God so close is just another desire.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Burn Your Martyr</span>
<br />No more god, no more Jesus, no more holy ghost. 
<br />No more lies, no suffering, just freedom. 
<br />No more guns, no more hate crimes on these broken streets. 
<br />No more lives taken away by machinery. 
<br />Born through pain... 
<br />Born through pain, born through hate, born in madness. 
<br />Born through tough circumstances seesed to be. 
<br />Hated life, hated the way we kill off the weak. 
<br />To feed the rich, we grow up without youth. 
<br />Broken glass... 
<br />Walk through the open door, 
<br />Turn your back away from me, 
<br />I feel your pain your suffering inside. 
<br />You liar... 
<br />No more light, no more discises from misery. 
<br />Take it head on, make it strong, don't walk away. 
<br />No more fear, relaps, wake up, get up, fight again. 
<br />No more talk of boundaries in your way. 
<br />Fuck it up... 
<br />Fuck it up, just start again, get back on track. 
<br />Realise your demons are in your head. 
<br />No more peace, no more race war, open your eyes. 
<br />Violence can only get you where you are. 
<br />Beating wounds... 
<br />Walk through the open door, 
<br />Turn your back away from me, 
<br />I feel your pain your suffering inside. 
<br />You liar... 
<br />Turn your back...
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Act Of Mercy</span>
<br />The corruption you shove in our faces,
<br />Is no longer accepted by our hand,
<br />All the rules and money you force on us,
<br />No longer a burden, just as meaningless as sand.
<br /><br />The promised land is not around us
<br />But hidden in the mountains, untouched, rough.
<br />So Pure and simply magnificent,
<br />And yet kept from us with distrust.
<br /><br />No need for money or electricty,
<br />Rules and laws are nature out here,
<br />Not just the man, fronting on the people,
<br />To get votes and a few more beers.
<br /><br />So beautifully placid and colourful,
<br />The wild is such a simple and free place,
<br />Breathing in the fresh air, eating fresh plaice,
<br />Got my diginty and morales, free from your race.
<br /><br />Free ill stay till i die, freedom oh so pure,
<br />It was freedom that led me here, 
<br />Freedom was my only cure,
<br />Not your thought out freedom with your chains made from money,
<br /><br />Lonley you may see me, but loney i am not,
<br />Family i once had, and are now forgot,
<br />So blindly, following the footsteps of,
<br />Such a fake nation, made powerfull by greed,
<br /><br />But greed made it powerfull,
<br />And its greed that shall bring it to a stop.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Black Horizon Sun</span>
<br />Black horizon sun, spirit cast away. 
<br />Left to die alone, soul under ruins. 
<br />Eyes project this hell, swallowed by the fire. 
<br />Dust and bones unite, creating the new beast. 
<br />Sun burns a hole, burning city waste. 
<br />Shadow waits for rain, failed by their god. 
<br />Air becomes toxic, Undertaker comes. 
<br />Destruction, black horizon sun.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">L.A.M.B</span>
<br />Lost! 
<br />No one takes tis burden,

<br />Poor Eddie couldn't dance, so he sat alone.
<br />Whilst the girls stood on their dancing shoes.
<br />Watching his palms get soaked, from the rain of his eyes.
<br />With no one looking, Eddie was the first one to leave.
<br /><br />Eddie grabbed a gun and off he goes (oh no!).
<br />Eddie grabbed a gun and off he goes!
<br /><br />So Eddie took lessons, next time he'll be on his feet.
<br />But no one cared for him, so the chain kept going on.
<br />Eddie couldn't settle down, standing at the back of the school bus.
<br />People wouldn't even turn around, not untill the day he was found.
<br /><br />Eddie grabbed a gun and off he goes (oh no!).
<br />Eddie grabbed a gun and off he goes!
<br /><br />Do you remember his name?
<br />I do, and in Eddies name we'll say as our friend...
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">Outkast, Me</span>
<br />You listen to me,
<br />My silly jokes,
<br />My stupid quotes...You like me.
<br />I notice when people talk,
<br />They talk about you,
<br />They dont know me...I don't exist.
<br />You should know by now...What my name is!
<br />All I heard today,
<br />Was random talk,
<br />As people walk by me...They dont know me.
<br />If I could shout,
<br />I'd scream outloud,
<br />But they wouldn't care...I don't exist.
<br />You should know by now...What my name is!
