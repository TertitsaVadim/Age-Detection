As guys schedule their tux fittings and plan out the stretch limo ride, girls ask themselves that eternal question: what should I wear?
<br />New Hot Sale Elegant Daffodil Strapless Sweetheart Evening Dress
<br /><br />Modern teenagers have a strong grasp of the latest fashion trends thanks to the popularity of television shows like “Gossip Girl.” However, Blair Waldorf is no average teen and living up to her fashion standards would be financially devastating. Thankfully, there are many ways to offset the cost of prom night fashion without sacrificing style. So read on for eight dress-shopping tips to help you start saving.
<br /><br />1. Think Classic
<br />The first lesson in frugality is versatility, meaning the more often you can wear something, the better value you receive in purchasing it. Look for a basic gown in classic colors like black, navy or grey that could be worn to other occasions. Tailor it to prom night with statement jewelery and killer heels in bold hues.

<br />2. Go Consignment Shopping
<br />Lots of young ladies sell their elegant red v-neck prom dresses through local consignment shops so you have a really good chance at finding a fabulous frock at the fraction of its original price. Cut your cost even further by selling clothes you no longer wear to the same second-hand reseller for credit toward a future dress purchase. Chain consignment shops are tailored to the teenage crowd, so scope out a nearby location.
<br /><br />3. Get Creative
<br />By now, you know it’s a good idea to shop sale racks at department stores. But have you heard of discount coupon code? Sites like charmgirl.co.uk let you to places at less than face value – meaning you can get a $10 to $20 or more discount – yielding 10-percent savings before you even enter the store.

<br /><br />4. Save at Bridal Shops
<br />Though you may want to avoid an all-out wedding dress on prom night, bridal shops carry a variety of colorful bridesmaid dresses perfect for prom. Shop the sale rack and don’t discount floor-length gowns at first glance. You can always get it altered for a shorter look and still come out ahead, budget-wise.
<br /><br />5. Rent Designer Duds
<br />If the realities of designer prices are crushing your dress dreams, consider renting. charmgirl.co.uk offers designer dress and accessory rentals for savings of up to 90-percent off retail prices. Each rental includes many sizes to ensure the right fit for no added cost and the site features a wide selection of cocktail styles and floor-length gowns like this stunning chiffon gown for just $75.

<br /><br />6. Get Employee Discounts
<br />If you’re in the market for a job, consider applying at department stores that carry formal attire since employees usually receive significant discounts off merchandise. Some speciality shops may be willing to provide a free prom dress in return for your part-time assistance, so ask around.
<br /><br />7. Swap at School
<br />Most high schools organize dress swaps to help students cut the cost of formal attire. This is a great opportunity to trade your gently warn dresses for something new at a fraction of the cost for a new dress. Plus, you will be happy knowing someone else feels beautiful in a dress you no longer need.

Yup, we’re talking about Katherine Heigl in 27 Dresses and the slew of bridezilla movies featuring the horrid bridesmaid’s dress. Yet, for those of us who have been there, done that, most wholesale bridesmaid dresses are somewhere between horrible/terrible/no good and the thoughtful bride’s insistence that it’s “soooo wearable.” To prevent having 27 “interesting” (for lack of a better word) bridesmaid dresses accumulating dust in your tiny closet, we’ve got five suggestions on how to recycle your bridesmaid’s dress.
<br />Bridesmaid Dresses Hibiscus Taffeta Strapless Neckline Sleeveless Floor Length Hemline
<br /><br />1. Sell it on Ebay
<br /><br />Is your dress from one of the go-to retailers? Other women are donning or will don these bridesmaids dresses, and there is someone out there who will need your baby blue silk chiffon number. If you’re not going to wear your long, plum-colored dress again (and trust us, you won’t), put it up for sale on eBay. You get some of your money back, and another bridesmaid gets her dress for a huge discounted price. Everyone wins!
<br /><br />2. Donate as a prom dress
<br /><br />When else can you wear a poofy dress in shiny pumpkin orange? Does prom ring a bell? So, most of us would rather eat a toenail than travel back in time to the days of braces and breakouts. (Plus, the slight problem that time travel hasn’t been invented yet.) Instead, donate your old bridesmaid dress to charities like the princess project and donate my dress that provide outfits for girls who can’t afford prom dresses. You get rid of your dress, a teen gets a dress for prom, and you may get a tax break! Again, everyone wins!

<br />3. Keep it handy for Halloween
<br /><br />Bridesmaids was the most talked about comedy of the year, and more importantly, it forever glorifies the crazy bridesmaids. Ride on the pop culture wave, and keep your dress readily available for Halloween. Gather up your other former ‘maids, and dress up as the entire Bridesmaids entourage this Halloween. Or just go solo as a zombie Maid of Honor. (Yeah, we added in the zombie part since people always dress up as zombie brides.) Either way, it saves you a trip to Party City and a $40 costume you’ll wear once.

<br />4. Alter it
<br /><br />Whether you’re a DIY chica or you’re BFFs with your tailor, consider alterations. While it’s unlikely that you’ll wear a satin red dress, you could wear it in pieces. Consider separating the dress into two parts, and voila, you have a top for a night out on the town. Or you have a slightly over-the-top skirt that you can temper with a calm top. If you wore a long number, consider shortening the length to a cocktail dress.
<br /><br />Amazing Sweetheart Floor-Length Brush Train Dresses
<br />We poke fun of less-than-stellar dresses, but the truth of the matter is that being asked to be a bridesmaid is really the highest honor when it comes to friendships. Consider repurposing the dress into a memorable gift for the bride. A quilt, headband, picture frame, or decorative pillow. The possibilities for creative reinterpretation are endless, depending on how handy you are in the sewing room.

<br />What style is going to suit you? It depends heavily on your body shape, so lets look at four common shapes and the styles that could suit you:
<br />Exquisite Ruched Sashes A-Line Strapless Sleeveless Tea-Length Bridesmaid Dresses
<br />Pear-shaped Body
<br /><br />Youre pear-shaped? Congratulations girl, youve got the most common body shape and are a real woman! Youve got a bigger bum and wider hips, so the focus is definitely your lower half.
<br />As a result youll want to choose a dress thats flattering to your curves whilst not highlighting your lower half and hips.
<br />Three suitable styles for your dress would be ball gown, A-line and Empire. All of which feature cheap prom dresses which drape over your body, but dont hug you too closely.
<br />Slinky fabrics like silk and satin could show off your hips too much, so it could be better to choose a heavier fabric like taffeta.
<br />If you are less confident about your shape then black is always a safe color choice as it is slimming on every woman.
<br />You should show off your bust and shoulders, so choose a strapless, spaghetti strap or sweetheart dress to blow the guys away.
<br /><br />Bridesmaid Dresses Black Satin Halter Neckline Sleeveless Floor Length Hemline
<br />Top-Heavy Body
<br /><br />All eyes are on you with your big bust! If you are the glamor girl style then youll want to show off your bust whilst minimizing broader shoulders.
<br />If youre going to display your curves at the party, and why not work it, then youll want to go for scooped, halter-neck or V-necked occasions dresses. These all show off the bust and are great for girls with a lot of curves up top.
<br />Remember to choose wide straps in order to hide your bras straps.
<br />Because the focus is naturally on your top half its better to choose a simpler design of dress without heavy embroidery, applique and beading. Ruffles, pleats and other weight-adding details should also be avoided as you could run the risk of looking too top heavy!
<br />Bridesmaid Dresses Moss Chiffon Cowl Neckline Sleeveless Floor Length Hemline
<br />Athletic Or Slim Body
<br /><br />If youre lucky enough to have an athletic or slim shape, maybe from your time in your hockey, basketball or soccer team, then you can choose a slinky mermaid or slip dress.
<br />Fabrics like silk and satin will hug your curves and really show off your great shape, and the shape of mermaid and slip dresses is flattering to slim figures.
<br />You can choose brighter colors too as theres no need for you to want to appear slimmer.
<br />If you choose styles like Empire or A-line these will suit you as they are flattering for every body type, but you can pull off a more slinky dress, so show off those toned muscles!
<br /><br />Glamorous Column Sweetheart Sleeveless Floor-length Luba's Prom/Bridesmaid Dresses
<br />Petite Girls
<br /><br />If youre a pocket rocket then maximizing your height is the name of the game.
<br />Dresses with shorter skirts can surprisingly help you to look taller, although if you choose a ball gown dress with a bodice and long dress it could have the opposite effect as the two distinct halves split up your height.
<br />Rather an A-line or Empire dress would be great for you as they accentuate your height and make you look like you have longer legs, because they have quite high waistlines and longer skirts.
<br />Avoid heavy patterns, horizontal lines and very wide skirts as these will sap your height and make you look wider.
<br /><br />Fashionable Cascading Ruffles Column Strapless Bridesmaid Dress
<br />Whatever your shape as long as you check which styles could suit you before your prom then youll be all set to turn up and make a splash in a super-flattering prom dress and can get on with enjoying the party!
<br /><br />Where to buy your dress? Traditional stores in malls or town will be able to help and you can try on different styles there as research, but really smart girls will do this and then shop online as you will have as much choice but also be able to save a lot of money.

<br />There are so many gorgeous prom dresses out there, but which is best suited to you?
<br />You need to consider different styles of dresses, your body shape and other factors like accessories.
<br />Lets look at must-read tips 1 to 5 for choosing the cheap prom dress that will get you noticed:
<br />Pink Short Sweetheart Cocktail/Homecoming Dresses
<br />1. Asymmetrical Dresses Can Cut Your Curves
<br />Asymmetrical dresses feature a diagonal waistline that runs across your body, usually starting above your own waistline. They are flattering as they serve to cover any curves that you may not like as the shape of the dress doesnt hug your body too closely. These dresses usually feature an open shoulder though, so if youre a little conscious about your neckline and arms then perhaps its better to choose a different style.
<br /><br />2. Choose Empire To Banish The Belly
<br />The Empire dress features a high waistline that starts just below your bust and has a long flowing dress that flows down from your waistline. If you do have a little belly or are conscious of this problematic area then the Empire is the way forward. Best of all its got that timeless Victorian-esque style and can help you look taller if youre petite.
<br />Taffeta One shoulder Sweetheart Short Cocktail Party Dress
<br />3. Let Shiny Fabric Work For You, Not Against
<br />Satin is a great choice for prom dresses as it shimmers in the light and looks fabulous, but you need to be careful as it can draw attention to any imperfections in your body. It is a fabric that reflects light so can add pounds, so make sure youve chosen a flattering dress style. It is also rather slinky and so can show up panty lines and curves, so think about your underwear before wearing satin!
<br /><br />4. Ruffle Some Feathers
<br />Ruffles are a great feature as these details of pleated fabric look classy and have been around for hundreds of years. If you have a very slim or boyish frame and small bust then ruffles on the top half of your dress can help to fill out your figure.

<br /><br />Where to Find Designer Cocktail Dresses

<br />To begin with are there any designers in particular that you personally prefer? It may save time to go directly to their website and see what they have on offer.
<br />There are so many designers out there these days, but here are a couple of suggestions to get you started:
<br /><br />Even if you don't have the budget to afford what they have on offer, you will at least be able to get a good idea of the style you like and then search other stores to see if they have something similar in your size.
<br /><br />Fabrics
<br /><br />Next, give some thought to what type of fabric you'd like. Especially when you are searching on the internet it pays to be specific and it saves plenty of wasted time sifting through irrelevant results.
<br /><br />Here are some ideas of the types of fabrics available to you:
<br /><br />A-line One Shoulder Beaded Chiffon Cocktail Dress
<br />? Silk? Chiffon? Satin? Velvet
<br /><br />Once you have decided you can direct your search accurately by entering 'silk 2011 Cocktail Dresses' or 'satin cocktail dresses' for example, into Google or whichever is your preferred search engine to find instantly what shops are currently stocking these types of dresses.
<br /><br />Length
<br /><br />The length for cocktail dresses is usually knee-length or just above. Any shorter and it becomes a mini! So saying, dresses can also be ankle length, but these are referred to as 'ballerina length'.
<br /><br />If you have been invited to a Cocktail Party either length of these semi formal dresses will suffice.

<br />Accessorizing your Dresses
<br /><br />If you choose a plain style of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGFybWdpcmwuY28udWsvMzktY29ja3RhaWwtZHJlc3Nlcw__" target="_blank">Designer Cocktail Dresses</a></strong> you might want to jazz it up a little by choosing an elegant purse that stands out from the crowd, perhaps in the same color, but with some intricate beading or even sequined design.

<br />Shoes in black or similar colored to your dress will go nicely. Remember that your shoes will stand out noticeably in a cocktail dress so you will want to be sure that if they are not new, they have been nicely polished and looking on top form.
<br /><br />High heels look great with designer evening dresses, but if that is not your thing don't be shy about wearing flats or something with a smaller or wedge heel. Cocktail parties are not usually sitting down affairs and being kind to your feet will certainly pay off in the future! If your feet are not used to high heels you will be in for a night of agony so I hope that you won't be tempted.

<br />How to define your wedding between formal and informal?If your wedding is going to be held after 8 p.m., it is considered very formal and you definitely need long bridesmaids' dresses. Having said this, I must tell you that tea-length and shorter length dresses are quite popular and gaining speed so as with most rules of etiquette, the waters are somewhat muddied. Just try to keep the level of formality consistent within all the attire.
<br /><br />Also, do not allow your bridesmaids to wear extremely short dresses, particularly if they are to be on an elevated platform at the front of the church! That is really not a suitable wedding apparel. I bet you don't want the girls to look like they are going clubbing -- unless your wedding is in a location where maybe you are going out after the ceremony.
