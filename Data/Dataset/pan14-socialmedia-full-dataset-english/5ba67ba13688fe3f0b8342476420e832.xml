I actually like school for the most part. I just get distracted sometimes. My parents don't really push me in school either so I have to push myself. I wish I knew what college I wanted to go to. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I want to either be a photographer, a musican(haha, which isn't going to happen. You know when you were little and people use to tell you 'you can be anything you want to be' thats a lie.), or working with kids. Or something completely different because I'm just 15 and I have no idea. I really can't wait to be older. Sorta. I mean, I don't wanna wish my life away. But there's really not much to wish away. I'm starting to think my life sucks, but I know it could be worse and I'm being optimistic about it somewhat. I wish my parents would push me in school. I don't get in trouble for getting an F, my mom just says that she's sure I'm trying harder and it will come up to a D and my dad doesn't talk to me about it usually(surprise!) My dad wants me to join the army or marines or some shit like he did but I doubt that hardcore. I doubt I'd want that but really and truely it is a possiblity. Who knows. My moms just happy that I haven't dropped out and don't plan to. I'm already doing better than her. She got married when she was 15 and had her first child at 17 and went back and got her GED when I was younger. I get scared thinking about the future. I need a plan. I need a damn job. -_-
<br />I'd be just fine not turning 16. No car, and I have to get a job. Yay. This is bullshit, but I guess when I think about it I can't expect to get a car I was just hopeing I would for the longest time. My parents are still paying off medical bills so it's selfish of me to expect a car. But still, this sucks. I want to work at Captain Video. I don't know if theyre hiring and I don't know if I have to be older than 16 and I'd have to have people drop me off all the time. But it's money, and free or discount tanning and videos and shit. It's gonna take forever to save up for a car.

<br />I turned seventeen
<br />That I bought those pills
<br />I thought I would need 
<br />And I wrote a letter 
<br />To my family
<br />Said it's not your fault
<br />And you've been good to me
<br />Just lately I've been feeling 
<br />Like I don't belong
<br />Like the ground's not mine 
<br />To walk upon
<br />And I've heard that music
<br />Echo through the house
<br />Where my grandmother drank
<br />By herself
<br />And I sat watching a flower
<br />As it was withering
<br />I was embarrassed by 
<br />It's honesty
<br />So I'd prefer to be remembered 
<br />As a smiling face
<br />Not this fucking wreck 
<br />That's taken it's place
<br /><br />So please forgive what I have done
<br />No, you can't stay mad at the setting sun
<br />We all get tired, I mean, eventually 
<br />There is nothing left to do but sleep
<br /><br />But spring came bearing sunlight
<br />Those persuasive rays
<br />So I gave myself 
<br />A few more days
<br />My salvation, it came
<br />Quite suddenly
<br />When Justin spoke 
<br />Very plainly
<br />He said, &quot;Of course it's your decision
<br />But just so you know
<br />If you decide to leave 
<br />Soon I will follow&quot;
<br /><br />I wrote this for a baby
<br />Who has yet to be born
<br />My brother's first child
<br />I hope that womb's not too warm
<br />Because it's cold out here
<br />And it will be quite a shock 
<br />To breathe this air 
<br />To discover loss
<br />So I'd like to make some changes 
<br />Before you arrive
<br />So when your new eyes meet mine
<br />They won't see no lies
<br /><br />Just love 
<br />Just love
<br />I will be pure
<br />No, no, I know I will be pure
<br />Like snow
<br />Like gold
<br />Like snow
<br />Like gold

<br />Florida in like 5 days!
<br />I'm feeling optimistic this morning. Yesterday I realized, I complain too much and I have a hell of a lot to be grateful for.
<br />You know, my sister is one of the few people I know I can be crazy around and she will be just as crazy back. It's weird, I use to think that if she wasn't my sister we would never talk to each other, and now I kind of think that if she wasn't my sister we might be friends.
<br />Why, in my dreams do people usually want to kill me, hurt me, pray on my insecurities, die with me, or fuck me.
<br />Weird. I love my dreams though, as strange as they are.
<br />&quot;But my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights if I could make the Earth and my dreams the same.&quot;
<br />I lost two pounds :]
<br />This chick on experienceproject.com sent me a message telling me i shouldnt be trying so hard to lose weight and blah blah blah and shes been there and blah. she said 'please write me back' so i did. Idk, I just have to if someone says it like that, they seem so desperate.
<br />As if I'm fucking stupid. As if I don't know where my proper weight range is. As if I fucking have some sort of goddamn eating disorder.
<br />People are fucking stupid. I was really nice to this chick though. I'm just too nice of a person I guess.
<br />Pool shark by Sublime is an amazing song. I love it. Poor Brad =/ He died of a herion overdose. I use to be so in love with Sublime, I still am I just haven't listened to them lately. But I heard that song yesterday. :] I loove it.
<br />Summer feels like it's going by too fast. :/

<br /><br />Herpes viruses are naturally found in many different animals (95 percent of humans carry some kind of herpes virus).
<br />“Everybody in this room has at least a couple herpes viruses running around,” Rohwer said at the symposium, causing some in the audience to chuckle. “And when you get stressed, or immuno-compromised, they’re going to start hopping out and giving you little cold sores or other wounds that we won’t talk about.” 
<br /><br />“That seems to be what’s going on in the corals too,” he added. 
<br /><br />Rohwer and Therber’s findings suggest that these disease outbreaks are just one of the many ways human activity is killing off corals. 
<br /><br />“They’re screwed no matter what we do to them,” Rohwer said.

We have to give our ferret away today. :[ Aww, I'm gonna miss the little critter. Anywho last night I realized how crazy I am about people who talk loud or don't turn off their phones when the movies playing. It drives me insane. I hate it more than anything. I don't really know why, but I was thinking about O.J. Simpson eariler. I wish he was in fucking jail. How do people think he's innocent? Who the hell writes a book after being accused of murder saying, if I did murder them this is how I'd do it right here. No sane person does that. It's a fucking confession, why couldn't people tell that?
<br />&quot;The proposed book's cover, as released by HarperCollins, showed a photograph of Simpson with the words &quot;I Did It&quot; in red and the word &quot;If&quot; in white. The red part is much more pronounced, with some taking that as a hint of confession. The white &quot;If&quot; tries to nullify this and give the cover the appearance of fiction.&quot;
<br /><br />Yeah I don't know exactly why I even started thinking about it.
<br />But, I'm gonna go make some coffee now.
<br />Bye darlings.

<br />he drowned in a bathtub before he had ever learned how to talk
<br />and i don't know what his name was but my mother does
<br />i heard her say it once, padriac my prince i have all but died from the
<br />sheer weight of my shame. you cried but no one came and the water filled your

<br />so i close the door and rest my head on the tile floor,
<br />sickness and sleep turning me cold.
<br />i am still not sure, is there some better place i could be heading towards?
<br />where the selfishly sick and self absorbed are welcome.
<br />i saw the future once.
<br />i was drunk in a phone booth.
<br />my eyes were wet and red but i could not tell what was said
<br />and through the screams of the traffic voices carried saying
<br />i am sorry
<br />on a day so gray its black inside
<br />watching churches on tv
<br />in a coma you don't dream you just hope that someone sits with you
<br />babies turn blue when they are ignored like the sky on summer days
<br />before you turn and walk away it has changed you
<br />so tonight to compensate i will poison myself
<br />another coughing, shaking fit in a bathroom that is spinning.

<br /><br />Okay so yesterday Kayla got on my nerves because she's pmsing and then she made me get off the phone because she was like i have to go to work tomorrow, I'll get off in 15 minutes because I have to sleep. So I got off the phone. And about an hour later I could get back on it, and then she was talking to mom about florida and she was like me &amp; nick are riding with you and amelia can ride with dad. Fuck that! I rode with dad all the way back home last year and me and dad dont get along and she knows it and she was like yeah well your gonna have to deal with it until i move out(which isnt gonna be till forever because she turns 18 in november but shes said like a thousand times that shes not moving out then. She'll be a senior so she'll probably wait until the school years over and probably move out when next summers over. She was being a bitch. So then I got back on the phone and she came in my room and tried to act like we were fucking best friends so I was like why are you in my room I hate you and she was like because I know you dont really mean that(which I dont but thats not the point) and I was like Oh, really? &amp; I left the room and then a couple seconds later she went back in her room and started complaining to mom about how mean I am. -_- and then I got a lil crunk and she told me to come to her room and i did and she was like I'm sorry I'm on period, I'm satan right now. So I was like its alright, beause when people start apologizing to me I feel like were in the fucking brady bunch or some shit. And then she was like no come here and she kept being all sweet and stuff so I got all sweet back just because I was crunk and I wasn't really mad at her, like not enough to stay mad at her. But I'm seriously not riding with my dad. But we didn't really talk about that anymore.
<br />With my sister, I don't exactly feel like she's my older sister(except for the fact that she can fight and I can't) like I'm more mature than she is, and she isn't really someone that knows when its a good idea to hide your emotions, and not just bring them all out. She's a really emotional person. It makes me feel like I have power over her(sounds weird, I know) but I've always felt that way. She calls me stupid and all this. but she asks me for my advice 24/7 and she always takes my advice, and if she doesn't shes like I wish I took your advice. It makes me feel like I'm the smart older perfect one when she gets all emotional and can't compose herself. That's probably mean, but its nice to feel like your older beautiful likeable sister who makes good grades and has a boyfriend she loves and BOTH parents actually like her, is the one thats the fuck up and your the perfect one. It's nice to feel that if only for a second.
<br />I really do love my sister. I can't imagine my life without her. It would suck a million times more.

<br />&quot;No one ever came to office hours except Rob Tway, who had always read something life altering and wanted to discuss its narrative arc and authorial stance and other issues of craft which I managed to avoid because I didn't really understand what craft was, frankly, and because I no longer read anything written after the Civil War. I endured these onslaughts only by reminding myself that someday Rob Tway would commit suicide.&quot;
<br />&quot;In most cases, people, even wicked people, are far more naive and simple-hearted than one generally assumes. And so are we.&quot;
<br />&quot;What does God want? Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?&quot;
<br />&quot;there are worse things than being alone but it often takes decades to realize this and often it's too late and there's nothing worse than too late.&quot;
<br />&quot;The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody’d move... Nobody’d be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;She looked sort of pretty when you first glanced at her but then you noticed how flawed she was. Her eyes were a pretty color, but shaped funny. Her nose was perfect but didn't fit right on her face. Her mouth was crooked. It was weird, like she was suppose to be gorgeous, but something went wrong.&quot;

<br />I'm just crazy right now because I haven't slept in a really long time and people in my family piss me off.
<br /><br />Anyway, I was watching tv earlier and just flipping through channels, and the Tyra Banks show was on and I watched a little bit of it. She's still talking about people calling her fat.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomedir-c.libsyn.com%2Fpodcasts%2F16eccc051979d4b5448290e5802217aa%2F469d170b%2Fgirl600%2Fimages%2Ftyra_bad_tabloid_anger_pic_fat.jpg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://homedir-c.libsyn.com/podcasts/16eccc051979d4b5448290e5802217aa/469d170b/girl600/images/tyra_bad_tabloid_anger_pic_fat.jpg</a>
<br /><br />She tells everyone to love their body and not worry about what other people say, btu she's a huge hypocrite.
<br />And, she has women dress up in these red bathing suits with their weight printed on them.
<br />She's trying to make herself feel better. That's all she's fucking doing.
<br /><br />Tyra Banks is a freak show.
<br /><br />Of course most of these women (besides the ones that are supposed to look 'super skinny', and she tries to make people feel sorry for) have a higher weight than her, and if they don't then they are a lot shorter than her so they look fatter than her.
<br /><br />I've seen her show before, I've seen how she brings girls on there that are 'messed up'. She tells them that they're ruinging their lives and she wants them to stop, because even though this particular episode is the only thing that connects Tyra to this 'messed up' girl, she really cares about her. 
<br />She wants to make herself feel superior to everyone else.

I didn't ever think I was but I complaian so much, now it feels like I am. I really feel like I haven't been myself lately? So what if I have depression, a lot of people have depression. It's just some people whine about it, and some people choose not to let it rule their lives. I didn't use to complain a lot but now I think I am just because I want attention. I'm so stupid. Once I have everyones attention, I never know what to do with it. I use to be simple &amp; carefree &amp; didn't let stupid stuff bother me. I want to be like that again. Maybe I've turned a little cinical, and I kind of like that &amp; I have a lot of insight, but I think I should find that balance between being a strong smart person, and being laid-back and just having fun too. Antidepressants would still be cool though even if I don't need them, because plain and simple, I just like taking pills. And a friend told me(that doesn't have depression) that they make you feel good. Even if this friend is a junkie (like a good percentage of my friends are).
<br />I think I can really be happy now. not fake-happy either, just true happiness.

<br />I've just felt like crap and been really tired and been trying to take care of my sister on top of that. Our scale is broken. I'm gonna get my mom to buy a new one hopefully. You have to estimate. It says I weigh 117 lbs. I don't really though. God, that would be horrible. Last time I checked on a scale I knew worked it said 110, and I feel skinnier since then and I've worked out and not ate like a pig, so hopefully it's less. Well, it will be less I know that.
<br />I've had kind of a rough week. :/
<br />But it's okay because tonight I'm going to go see Transformers with some friends, and tomorrow I'm going to the mall. So I'm happy.
<br />I'm reading Timeline right now, it's not the best book and it's too technical for some, but it's not bad. The movie is whats bad. Jesus, that movie sucks ass. I'm going to try to go to a bookstore or a library and get some new books because all the ones we have besides Timeline I've read a million times.
<br />The only really good books we have are Sophie's World, which Sterling has(I highly doubt she ever read it though.), The Things They Carried, which is amazing, and Haunted, which Chelsea has. Other than that none of them are anything special.
<br />:]
<br />I know someone whose pregnant.
<br />Well I know a lot of people that are pregnant but now I know someone close to me that's pregnant. She's five weeks pregnant, and if it's a girl she might name it Layla.
<br />I think after my sister because they're close too.
<br />I'm gonna go take a cold shower. I hope it helps.

But putting it up for adoption is way better than killing it. Especially since there are a lot of unfertile couples that would love to have a baby. I could never do this. I couldn't carry a life inside of me for a while and then decide that I want it killed and afterwards just go on with my life. I would never forgive myself. If you're reading this and you got an abortion for whatever reason, that's fine. I'm not trying to judge you, it's your life.
<br />But if she goes through with this I know it will change the way I look at her entirely.
<br />She needs to think about it longer than 24 hours.
<br /><br />&amp; she's already made an appointment.
<br />:[
<br /><br />God, I wish I was older. I would take care of that baby in a second. I felt like crying all day but I was in public so I didn't want to make a scene or anything. But now I really want to cry.
<br /><br />I haven't cried in so long..

It looks a little better now but seriously, ew. I don't think I've ever gotten hives before. Anywho, I'm reading this book I bought yesterday called Hit Parade. It's pretty good. It's not amazing, but it's not bad at all. I like it. It's about a hit man, but most people would probably guess that from the title. I'm supposed to be doing laundry. And I have to take a shower and make myself not look like hell. I always have dark circles under my eyes. I've heard that your supposed to put a spoon on your eye or something, I don't know if that works. I might try it though. I'm tired of looking like a racoon. But I can get ready later because I'm going to a party and it's not like it'll start soon.
<br />I'm starting to wonder if me &amp; Jenna are still friends. I was supposed to call her about a week ago to hang out and I kept putting it off. I don't know why. We always have fun together, so I don't know why I wouldn't want to hang out with her? Maybe I'm just too lazy to call people. That's probably it. I usually just let people call me. I don't really even like phones. I should've bought a scale that works yesterday while I was out buying random shit. I don't know how much I weigh but I know it's still too much. I need more willpower. We have a bunch of vitiman water, and I drink it because it's good for you but the pink kind tastes like shit, but we also have the orange kind and that ones alright.

<br />With our knuckles interlocked 
<br />Black dresses flood the cemetery 
<br />In this cliche tragedy 
<br /><br />Just do as you're instructed and.... 
<br />Take this razor and cut your palms 
<br />I'll do the same until a river of crimson begins to flow 
<br />Now drip your ruby red over the casket 
<br />A funeral for my once loved youth 
<br /><br />My secret is fatally gorgeous 
<br />I'd die for you 
<br />But in this Bonnie and Clyde kind of romance 
<br />Tell me what would you do? 
<br />My secret is fatally gorgeous 
<br />I'd die for you 
<br />But when your precious life is at stake 
<br />Tell me would you die for me too? 
<br /><br />The quivering liquids in your stomach 
<br />Will eat away at the bad habits that have made you 
<br />A real character in the story of your now distant life 
<br />Goodnight and goodbye, quickly 
<br /><br />In gentle greens we stand side by side 
<br />With your head buried in my chest 
<br />Black veils send me shivering 
<br />The fear that part of me is dying 
<br /><br />Just do as you're instructed and.... 
<br />Take this razor and cut your palms 
<br />I'll do the same until a river of crimson begins to flow 
<br />Now drip your ruby red over the casket 
<br />A funeral for my once loved youth 
<br /><br />My secret is fatally gorgeous 
<br />I'd die for you 
<br />But in this Bonnie and Clyde kind of romance

<br /><br />The quivering liquids in your stomach 
<br />Will eat away at the bad habits that have made you 
<br />A real character in the story of your now distant life 
<br />Goodnight and goodbye, quickly, quickly 
<br /><br />Goodbyes are said and roses thrown 
<br />And the crowd starts to weep 
<br />But the irony of the story is when I fell to my knees 
<br />And began clawing at the dirt in front of the tombstone 
<br />Of my bashful childhood 
<br />With you by my side, you're screaming at the 
<br />Top of your lungs, &quot;let it go&quot; 
<br />And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs 
<br />&quot;The ceremony was not proper, there was not enough people, 
<br />And who picked the music? 
<br />Those melodies almost made me physically sick&quot; 
<br /><br />My secret is fatally gorgeous 
<br />I'd die for you 
<br />But in this Bonnie and Clyde kind of romance 
<br />Tell me what would you do? 
<br />My secret is fatally gorgeous 
<br />I'd die for you 
<br />But when your precious life is at stake 
<br />Tell me would you die for me too?

<br />A real character in the story of your now distant life 
<br />Goodnight and goodbye, quickly 
<br />Goodnight and goodbye, quickly
