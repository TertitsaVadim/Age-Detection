<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                                  13 August 2010 
<br /><br />So I’ve been spelling this wrong all these years.  The fear of thirteen as opposed to the fear of the day Friday the Thirteenth (we’ll get to that in a minute) is known as triskaidekaphobia and comes from the Greek for “three and ten fear [of]”.  Why in our society such a prevalent fear or irrational reaction exists about the expression of a particular value (all a number is) seems to be even more prevalent and irrational – why you won’t find a thirteenth floor in many buildings, for instance – because we don’t know when or where it started.  We can’t point to one point and say “there it is”; we like control, we like to know, with our fears as well as with anything else.  
<br /><br />The thirteen that most comes to mind (oh, the fear of FRIDAY the thirteenth is “friggatriskaidekaphobia” beginning with the Norse goddess whose name became our word “Friday”) is the assembly of Jesus and His disciples for the passover – what most of us know as the Last Supper!  (Curse you, da Vinci!)  We don’t know if Judas was the last person to show up for dinner in John 13, but we do know he was the first one to leave by verse thirty; Jesus plus twelve disciples makes thirteen present.  That and Jesus being crucified on what’s regarded by His church today as Good Friday led or may have led to Friday the 13th being combined to become more than a horror film series.
<br /><br />I’m borrowing from Captain America or at least one of his writers here: “It’s not wrong to be frightened – you just can’t let fear dictate your actions.”  Certainly when you and I are called to the fear of the Lord we aren’t called to quake in terror!  Fear in the context we usually see it in regard to God we’d regard in today’s English as “revere” or “honor”, but if we are fearful of doing anything that displeases God, then we’re kept from doing something especially wrong to Him or others.  In that case, along the lines of being afraid to touch a pan on a hot stove, fear is a good thing.  Good for self-preservation.  
<br /><br />“Let not your heart be troubled” appears twice in the fourteenth chapter of John, verses one and twenty-seven.  Jesus’ words to His disciples before Gethsemane to pray, be arrested, convicted of a capital offense, and die was as much an admonition to Himself as it was to them.  As the hours came down, come down for each one of us, it’s easy to be afraid.  But fear like any other emotion is energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed but be redirected.  “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”  So we’re told in Hebrews 12:2.
<br /><br />That’s far more important to guide our life by than any numbers, signs, or patterns, don’t you think?  A Person and not a concept, a faith and not a religion, a vocation and a voice?  “Despising the shame” doesn’t make it go away, it removes said state’s power to affect you.  Acting in spite of one’s fear – to face danger when you are afraid, as the Cowardly Lion was told he did (in the book, not the movie) – doesn’t guard us from failure but it does keep us from being less than God created each of us to be.  While you and I may not and have not and most likely will not be everything God created us to be, we’ll become more than we thought we could be.  And in possibility, there’s God.   
<br /><br />Sincerely yours, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                                  20 August 2010 
<br /><br />“Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” has been one of my favorite books since the second grade.  After lunch for more than a month, my second grade teacher Mrs. Stanmier would have all of the kids in class lay their heads down on their desks and she’d read us a chapter.  I only remember the sound of her voice reading the Oompa-Loompas’ song lamenting the fate of Augustus Gloop (“the great big greedy nincompoop”) but the whole story did – pardon the pun – stick with me and still does, despite the efforts of two movie adaptations that don’t do the book justice!  My opinion; like a nose, we’ve all got one. 
<br /><br />Happy Birthday Kaitlin!  One scene that’s escaped either adaptation comes is the book’s twenty-third chapter, “Square Candies That Look Round”.  You’ve got Willy Wonka showing these candies he’s very proud of, candies that “looked very much like square sugar lumps – except that each of them had a funny little pink face painted on one side.”  Mike Teavee starts and Veruca Salt (just before she falls down the garbage chute in the next chapter) continues arguing that the candies do NOT look round, they look square.  Mr. Wonka replies that of course they’re square and they only look round.  Then he opens the room … 
<br /><br />And the candies with the faces on them turn to face Mr. Wonka, looked ROUND (or around; tricky language, English).  The trick here – as I just realized rereading the chapter yesterday – is that what people say isn’t always what they’re interpreted as meaning.  Certainly none of us expect to see candy in our local store turn to face us; we’re the ones that have to face it and pick it up for purchase if we’re so inclined to do so.  I grant you that personal salvation in Jesus Christ is not something we can buy or even consider ourselves worthy of, but we need it.  
<br /><br />What does God have to do to impress us?  Are we so jaded by seeing miracles everywhere with babies being born and what worked as miracles in Jesus’ day (making the lame walk and the blind see; we can’t do it completely, but we can do far more in the thousand years since) that we fail to see the greatest miracle of all?  I’m reminded of the atheist whose book I once read who said he’d become a Christian if he saw a genuine miracle.  Sounds like he will – and we will too often – place more faith in human nature to overcome our obstacles and doubts than in God to increase our faith. 
<br /><br />From a story set in a chocolate factory to Jesus relating the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31 seems like a wild jump, but think about it.  After both the rich man and Lazarus had died, Lazarus found himself in the bosom of Abraham – the Jewish concept of heaven – while the rich man found himself in hell due to a choice they’d made while they lived.  Jesus doesn’t go into detail on their spiritual journeys unto death, and we can get bogged down in that, looking for reasons to doubt or deny God because others before us have.  
<br /><br />What will ultimately change any of us is not the miracle that is contrary to what we know of nature (I’m borrowing Augustine’s definition there) being performed right in front of us.  Jesus admits that as much in the story when he cites Abraham in verse thirty-one saying that “If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.”  From a spiritual standpoint, the rich man’s five brothers from verse twenty-eight were dead already because they’d never made the effort to live, to come to God a la the allegory in the parable of the prodigal (or lost) son in Luke 15. 
<br /><br />How can the risen dead witness to the dead?  “Neither will they be persuaded …” and neither will we, when we’re limiting ourselves to the realities we can touch and see and perceive.  That’s why our study of God’s Word and not limiting ourselves to what others say about it – ultimately, all even the best preachers can do since we’re NOT the Word – is so important, not because we only draw away what we want to read but due to our inability to see, in keeping with today, that square candies (us in the factory room) CAN look round!  Yes we can!          
<br /><br />Sincerely yours, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                                8 October 2010 
<br /><br />“The earth cooled ... its surface scum hardened into continents ... oceans fell from the sky ... and if you believe most biology textbooks, life emerged from nutrient-rich puddles of ‘organic soup.’  There’s only one thing wrong with the organic-soup hypothesis: it's almost certainly false ... and most scientists know it.  But, in the absence of a better idea, they have held onto this one.”  (Larry Gonick, “The Cartoon History of the Universe”, volume 1, 1990)  
<br /><br />In the absence of a better idea … wow, that’s got to take a lot of faith.  Personally, how long the earth has existed – there are old Earth and young Earth proponents and this is no more a determinant of whether you’ll get into heaven that what color the church carpet is – doesn’t matter.  Whether you believe that life emerged … oh wait, life DID emerge.  Genesis 2:7 “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”  But let’s go back further than that: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” Genesis 1:1. 
<br /><br />God’s first line – Genesis 1:3 “Let there be light:” – shows that to create a world, an existence in which man and woman and animals can dwell in He has to start with creating … well, the world.  And evidently it’s hard for “most scientists” to accept something they can’t conceive making happen themselves.  “But God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise;” so it’s expounded in 1 Corinthians 1:27.  I’d say those who think they are wise; how simple [not “dumb”, there’s a movement about to make those synonyms] is it to believe there is a Creator, and why don’t we want a simple life?  
<br /><br />“I do not mean to say that they are wrong.  But I hold that we know by far too little of this entire period to reconstruct that … with any degree (however humble) of accuracy.  And I would rather not state certain things than run the risk of stating certain things that were not so.”  (Hendrik Willem van Loon, “The Story of Mankind”, 1921) 
<br /><br />Perhaps it’s not that we want a simple life so much as a simplified one.  To “be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves” as Jesus originally sent His twelve disciples to be in Matthew 10:16 doesn’t necessitate being an idiot.  People often hear “simple” and equate that with “easy” or “dumb”, but even God’s harshest critics would be hard pressed to prove Peter, Andrew, James, John, and the rest were slow on the uptake in the world they lived in.  Impulsive, yes; skeptical, yes; but it’s these people willing to take a leap forward in faith who discover for themselves the Holy Spirit and through whom He works.  It’s the same thing with us today, when we believe. 
<br /><br />It’s being willing to promulgate our ideas, what we want to believe, when evidence doesn’t prove or leaves very open to interpretation that leads us into circles.  For the sake of argument, let’s go with the organic-soup idea from the first paragraph.  That had to come from somewhere – something dead or life-lacking cannot suddenly become alive and life-promoting without some outside influence.  Whether the warmth and nourishment of a mother’s womb or the poetically rendered laying on of sinews and flesh and bones and breath per Ezekiel 37 or even being created from the dust of the earth in Genesis … all creation had to start with something.  I amend that, Someone. 
<br /><br />And that’s a better idea, David 
<br /><br />Sincerely yours, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          4 November 2010 
<br /><br />WORD COUNT: 6,378
<br /><br />“The reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good.  Now, the Nome King had never tried to be good, so he was very bad indeed.”  I’m writing my novel for National Novel Writing Month (check out “progeny4” at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nanowrimo.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.nanowrimo.org</a> to track my progress) and for this month all I write online is going out with the titles of chapters from L. Frank Baum’s sixth Oz book, “The Emerald City of Oz.”  
<br /><br />One story that usually doesn’t make it into Bible studies – so I’ll excuse you for not knowing about it – is told in Genesis 34.  It’s a story of revenge, so it fit today.  Jacob’s daughter Dinah (yes, he did have a daughter too; his and Leah’s seventh child and tenth overall, from Genesis 30:21) and the rest of his family found themselves in the land of Shechem and had pitched their tent to settle just outside the city of Shalem.  
<br /><br />One day when Dinah “went out to see the daughters of the land”, Shechem the son of Prince Hamor who ruled the land saw her and raped her.  (“Defiled” in King James just doesn’t cut it today.)  Then he fell in love with her (verse three’s “his soul clave unto Dinah … and he spoke kindly unto the damsel”) and wanted to marry her, so Shechem asked his dad to arrange it with Jacob.  
<br /><br />Given the circumstances of Dinah and Shechem’s first meeting, this did not sit well with Jacob or his sons, as we’ll find out.  But he bit his tongue (verse five’s “held his peace”) as Hamor asked him to give his daughter Dinah to her son Shechem in marriage and also offered to let his people in verses nine and ten intermarry with them.  It sounded beneficial to everybody, and Shechem himself offered to do anything Jacob and his sons asked (but not Dinah, noticeably in verse eleven) to marry her. 
<br /><br />“And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:” If the sons hadn’t taken lessons from the master of deceiving his brother, then his father, then his uncle, they were doing a good imitation.  You want to marry into our family, Jacob’s sons say in verses fourteen through seventeen?  That’s cool, but you have to be circumcised first.
<br /><br />Hamor and Shechem did not object to cutting off their foreskins (what circumcision is, guys) and neither did the other men of Shalem, if it meant that Jacob and his people would unite as one people with them.  (He must have built up a pretty good reputation in the area by then.)  So three days after their circumcision, they were still hurting – it’s one thing to get the foreskin cut off at birth, quite another when you’re an adult I imagine.
<br /><br />Simeon and Levi, the second and third sons of Jacob and Leah, took advantage of this (and evidently not with their dad’s approval) and we’re told in verse twenty-five killed every man in the city.  Hamor and Shechem were killed in Shechem’s own house where Dinah was apparently visiting by verse twenty-six, and Jacob’s other sons followed and took everything in Shalem that was not nailed down.
<br /><br />The women and children got to live, but everything else was fair game for Jacob’s sons.  And the patriarch was not happy.  Verse thirty: “And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.”
<br /><br />Translated, What have you done?  Understandably, Jacob feared retaliation and knew he and his were vastly outnumbered and out-armed.  Simeon and Levi’s response was another question.  “Should he deal with our sister as a harlot?”  End of story.  And if you’re looking for some deep or simple Gospel message pointing to repentance and trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, I have not got one from this story.
<br /><br />“To me belongeth vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.”  Deuteronomy 32:35 gets hammered into this phrasing we’re probably more familiar with from Paul’s letter to the Romans, chapter twelve verse nineteen: “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”  
<br /><br />When you and I want vengeance or revenge or just to “get even”, we are perfectly willing to do so out of all proportion to the crime committed.  Gilbert and Sullivan’s opera “The Mikado” has the title character sing and act upon “let[ting] the punishment fit the crime”, and lest you think massacres like this occurred only in Biblical times and they’re probably horrendously magnified, I cite two twentieth-century examples.
<br /><br />Rosewood, Florida, 1923.  Lidice, Czechoslovakia, 1942.  All the men were killed and few women and children survived.  It’s likely you know some examples I’m not thinking of, and the point is that God knows our urges to wreak havoc and ruin in the name of justice.  And that’s why justice lies ultimately in His hands, HAS to be God’s to dispense for it to be truly justice.  For how much justice is enough to satisfy us?

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          12 November 2010 
<br /><br />WORD COUNT: 17,095 
<br /><br />It is frustrating when you and your kids are putting together a jigsaw puzzle and you end up with two or three pieces missing!  At least it is to me, which is why a jigsaw puzzle is one of the things you should NOT accept as a hand-me-down and buy it new.  Consider what Dorothy and her friends when they arrived at the town of Fuddlecumjig, the subject of the chapter from L. Frank Baum’s “The Emerald City of Oz” that contributed today’s title!  There all the people are puzzles – that is, if you find pieces lying around, it’s likely they are parts of people that visitors can have fun putting together.
<br /><br />When Aunt Em asked why the Fuddles don’t just behave themselves and stay put together (they were prone to scatter at any loud noise), Larry the Lord High Chigglewitz who led the Fuddles replied, politely but curtly: “Madam, you have perhaps noticed that every person has some peculiarity. Mine is to scatter myself. What your own peculiarity is I will not venture to say, but I shall never find fault with you, whatever you do.”  Since I’m writing a novel for National Novel Writing Month (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nanowrimo.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.nanowrimo.org</a>) and its crux is the book “The Emerald City of Oz”, I sought a lesson from God out of this.
<br /><br />And found it.  Criticize my style all you want, but I won’t stand for tampering.  But our own puzzle in living this life God has called us to (what Jesus His Son refers to as Himself “come that [we] might have life, and that [we] might have it more abundantly” in John 10:10) gets solved when we yield our own authority, our right to be right if you will, to do with the gifts of the Spirit much MUCH more than we could ever do ourselves.  Certainly pieces scattered all over, of ourselves or of others, can’t do anything.  But my question is: who are we allowing to put us together?
<br /><br />If it’s other people, even the ones closest to us and with the best of intentions, we will meet with failure every time.  If it’s Satan (“the thief” from the aforementioned verse who comes “to steal, and to kill, and to destroy”), it’s sure to feel great and maybe even be great for a while, but ultimately it will destroy us.  If it’s God putting us together, the LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.  Other translations render Psalm 23:1 as “I shall lack no good thing,” but keep going.  “He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul:” Who else can claim to do that?
<br /><br />And if it’s YOU?  Well, if you can attest like Larry that “we are no puzzles to ourselves, and so there wouldn’t be any fun in it,” more power to you.  But very often you and I are the biggest puzzles to ourselves; we’re the people we have to face in the mirror and not for nothing does James say that a double-minded man – I expect such a woman too – is unstable in all their ways (1:8).  For years I’ve so wanted to “add” a beatitude to the ones Jesus gives in the Sermon on the Mount (e.g. “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”) recorded in Matthew 5:3-12, and it fits with today’s lesson.
<br /><br />“Blessed are the piece-makers, for they shall finish the puzzle.”  Ok, so that’s my play on Matthew 5:9’s “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”  But look at that another way; you and I can finish and solve a puzzle, but who provides the pieces and who made them in the first place to be solved?  It’s not beyond our abilities to solve the puzzle of ourselves … well, ourselves.  But it IS beyond our ability to stay together.  L. Frank Baum, the author of the Oz books, may not have intended the Fuddles to provide a Gospel lesson, but we can see one and it works.
<br /><br />For my part, I’m glad we visited the Fuddles.  
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.            Isaiah 18:3 
<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          3 December 2010 
<br /><br />Okay, okay, no more “how”s beginning Ensign titles for the rest of the year!  (Come on, rejoice a little bit with me!)  Got a bit burned out on them after using chapter titles from “The Emerald City of Oz” (that all begin with “how”) all month.  But one friend’s Facebook status a couple of weeks ago – something to the effect of “has the epic lost its meaning” – prompted me to keep this one in the back of my mind.  Because the greatest story ever told can lose meaning for us when we lose our ability to be awed, as though immaculate conceptions happen every day.
<br /><br />“And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,” so begins the passage from Luke 1:26 where Mary learns that she’s going to be the one to mother Jesus, the Son of God.  At our men’s Bible study this past Saturday we read this story from verse twenty-six through thirty-eight, and one question occurred to us we had no definite answer for.  How old was Mary when she had Jesus?
<br /><br />We know from Scripture she and Joseph had other children (at least five – Joses, Simon, Judas, and two daughters per Matthew 13:55), and in keeping with Jewish custom of two thousand years ago that was by and large tolerated and accepted as long as it didn’t interfere with Roman rule, Mary would have become a woman in the sense of assuming the rights and responsibilities of adulthood after her first period.
<br /><br />“To a virgin espoused [betrothed, a stronger-than-engagement yet short-of-marriage bond] to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.”  However old she was when Gabriel appeared and announced that she would be Jesus’ earthly mother, Mary took the news as well as I expect any of us would … not quite in all a panic, but enough to want to know “Why me?”
<br /><br />After being hailed by Gabriel for what she is about to do, Mary’s not quite as astounded by the mechanics of it all (despite the wording of her question, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” in verse thirty-four) as she is than an angel is showing up to tell her this.  So it’s important, and please don’t think of Gabriel as a cute little cherub; EVERYBODY is freaked out in Scripture when one of God’s messengers shows up!
<br /><br />Gabriel points out an example recorded in verse thirty-six that Mary or may not have known about.  “And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.”  But whether Mary did or not (and I’d expect Elisabeth was considerably older than she), she knew what Gabriel already said in her heart: For with God nothing shall be impossible.
<br /><br />This along with the revelation that Jesus would be the Son of God (for more on this, read verses thirty-one through thirty-five) pushed Mary to not only believe what Gabriel was saying but also accept her own part in God’s grand epic – so it does not lose its meaning – regardless of how high (the earthly mother of Jesus, that’s as high as you can go) or low it was (consider the connotation we give “handmaid” per verse forty).  We can too.

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          10 December 2010 
<br /><br />Last week we saw Mary had the angel Gabriel appear to her and not only state that she would give birth to Jesus Who would be the promised Messiah of the Jewish people (and ultimately of the whole human race) but also that her relative – “cousin” is the popular translation, but the Greek it’s translated from is not so accurate – Elisabeth was six months pregnant already.  Elisabeth, “who was also called barren” per Luke 1:36, who was told before by well-intentioned doctors of that day and even others that she wouldn’t have a child, would have one.
<br /><br />Let’s look at the background for a minute earlier in the chapter.  Verse five: “There were in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah, of the course of [descended from] Abijah: and his wife was of the daughters [descendants] of Aaron [Israel’s first high priest, Moses’ brother], and her name was Elisabeth.”  Verse six should raise an important point with you and me. “And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”  Sure, Zechariah and Elisabeth were still sinners, but no one could accuse them of wrongdoing – in this context, acting against God as well as others – without lying.
<br /><br />What a testimony to have someone say about us!  But life has a tendency to happen to us; we’re told in verse seven that Elisabeth was barren and could never, under normal circumstances, bear children and it that culture of that day it was a social stigma.  (Sometimes it is here and now too.)  It’s likely Zechariah knew this as he entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense, and just before he does so – ULTIMATE REALITY BREAK! – an angel appears to him.  “And when Zechariah saw him, he was troubled; and fear fell upon him.”  Understandably, for we’re never told in Scripture what angels look like – the wings and halos are medieval, the cuteness is Victorian – except that they will awe you.
<br /><br />So the angel says to Zechariah to not be afraid of him “for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.”  We’re not told in verse thirteen whether Zechariah was praying for a child or for the salvation of Israel (one of his priestly functions, alluded to in Daniel 9:20), but from what we know later of their son – who’d become known to history as John the Baptist – he does in a manner of speaking fulfill both functions.  For when he’s baptizing people and exhorting them to repent of their sins at the Jordan River thirty years later in Luke 3, he’s pointing to Jesus Who will save Israel (and again, ultimately the whole human race if they choose).
<br /><br />After Gabriel – for the angel identifies himself in verse nineteen as the one who appeared (correction, will appear) to Mary six months from now – relates what John will do “filled with the Holy Ghost” “to make ready a people prepared for the Lord”, it’s Zechariah who is skeptical.  Verse eighteen: “Whereby shall I know this?  for I am an old man, and my wife is stricken in years.”  So OK, be skeptical … you just don’t get to tell anybody about it until your son is born!  By verse twenty, Gabriel strikes Zechariah dumb (not stupid, think mute and unable to speak in our language today) out of sight of those worshiping in the temple, so when he emerged and was unable to say anything they were astonished. 
<br /><br />“And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of [Zechariah’s] ministration were accomplished, he went to his own house.”  Zechariah’s behavior in verse twenty-three we can understand; how easily we take for granted the power to communicate, by words or deeds!  Elisabeth’s was not an immaculate conception like Mary’s was (correction, would be) so it was not long after returning home that with Zechariah’s … help “Elisabeth conceived, and his herself five months, saying, Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.” (24-25)
<br /><br />We do not look down upon people without children as much as the Jews of two thousand years ago did, or do we?  But we have to be careful, or we’ll come to view our children as means to an end not as unique, one-of-a-kind people created by God.  Resist the temptation to make our sons or daughters mini-mes, and I’m the first person to admit this is hard even now when my kids are just four and three!  But there’s a lot of young people who watch me, and I know I’ve got to model faith – say yes as the Lord speaks when the world and logic says no – if I ever expect others to follow my example, even poor as it is.  When the Lord deals with you or me, He’ll do it in a way you know Who did it. 
<br /><br />Merry Christmas, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          24 December 2010  
<br /><br />The year 2010 was a crazy one.  Obviously, we’ve all aged – I will turn thirty-nine (my birthday is December eleventh, when this letter probably has gone out or you’re reading it), Martha’s thirty-three, Sarah’s four, and Jeffrey’s three – and some wear and tear is starting to show.  Oh, nothing bad … unless you count Martha’s mom Sharon being touch-and-go for a while late this fall due to complications from a gall bladder removal, and Sarah’s weekend hospitalization due to asthma in July that we’re keeping watch on. 
<br /><br />But there’s a lot of hope this year.  My mom whom we went to see in June over Father’s Day weekend out of concern for her declining health – she’s been in an assisted living facility since January – is sounding a lot better than she did.  Practically my whole side of the family (I’m the youngest of my mom’s six children) was there.  Sarah started her second year of Sunday School, and this is Jeffrey’s first year.  They are having lots of fun! 
<br /><br />While I have been Fast Cash office manager seven years for Dakota pawnbroker and 2nd Hand as of September, Martha chose for health reasons to leave Wal-Mart at the start of December after two years and start a new job as a courier for Trinity Health.  Her last day at Wal-Mart was Friday [so this was written three weeks ago – D.], and the following Monday she was scheduled to start with Trinity!  Quite the planner who works her plan, Martha is … she also started a paper route last October delivering the Minot Daily News to the Bel-Air section in the northwest part of town.  It’s actually two routes combined into one, where I take two streets and Martha delivers to a variety of uphill residents in cul-de-sacs. 
<br /><br />It took a while, but I’m actually getting used to getting awake at four thirty in the morning when our papers arrive … in keeping with my publication dreams, I’ve produced another Bible study devotion on CreateSpace this January “Unto the Brethren” (ISBN 9781449996574) based on the New Testament book of Acts and this November with the National Novel Writing Month I pounded out the fifty thousand word plus manuscript of “Refugees From The Emerald City” to be released, for it still needs tweaking.  I’ll be interviewed on radio by Janice Lee of the program “Featuring the Arts” that’s broadcast on WSKV 104.9 FM out of Stanton, Kentucky.  [This happened December sixth. – D.]  If you can’t or didn’t catch the program, a link’s available on the website, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.featuringthearts.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.featuringthearts.com</a>. 
<br /><br />This will be a great start, and I’m looking forward to it along with this New Year with my family.  And Merry Christmas as well, and God bless us every one!         
<br /><br />Love, 
<br /><br />David, Martha, Sarah, and Jeffrey

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          14 January 2011 
<br /><br />Moralistic therapeutic deism.  When I noticed a Facebook friend’s status last month citing this as what Christianity seems to have become in the United States, it struck me hard.  I’d remembered hearing this term years before, but when I looked it up online I’d found the term was published about a decade later than I thought.  (The Oxford English Dictionary I’m not nor did I use.)  Anyway, MTD – the abbreviation for moralistic therapeutic deism – was introduced in a 2005 book resulting from a research project called the National Study of Youth and Religion.  Based on interviews with about three thousand teenagers, MTD was congealed as the common religious belief system among American youth.  I see where they’re coming from.  
<br /><br />“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.”  And this is nothing new.  Paul’s second letter to Timothy written in about the late sixties of the first century opens its third chapter with this passage.  If you hear enough preacher talk, we’re more in the last days – the time when the world is at its most chaotic before Jesus Christ returns to Earth – than we have ever been.  Well, we’ve been in the last days for the past two thousand years, and I expect all of you reading this were born and have been raised hearing some form of this.  Don’t panic (Arthur Dent: It’s the first intelligent thing anyone has said to me today.) for if the end of the world IS coming, there’s very little you and I can do about it, is there?
<br /><br />A moral, by the definition at Dictionary.com, is a principle or habit with respect to right or wrong conduct.  But just who or what sets the standards of what is right or wrong, who or what establishes those principles and habits within us?  Also, what is “right” or “wrong” anyway?  If this sounds confusing, it is … one of the tenets of MTD seems to be that God – oh, this never denies God but seems rather to relegate Him to an impersonal personhood – because He is good Himself wants people to be good, nice, and fair to each other, as most of the world’s religions teach.  Sounds great, but it opens up the temptation that “I can do whatever I want as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone else” life becomes trivial and purposeless, not worth the pursuit.     
<br /><br />“For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,” God certainly does not condemn loving yourself – after all, He made you – but there is a thin line between self-love, the healthy kind that keeps you from killing or wounding yourself, and self-obsession.  When we love something so much that we’re obsesses with getting it, careless of who gets in our way, we become covetous and that God expressly forbids in the tenth commandment (Exodus 20:17).  And since every commandment in the Ten Commandments – not the Ten Morals, that’s important! – is practically the same (e.g. if you love God then you’ll love others, if you won’t steal then you won’t kill, for breaking one commandment is breaking them all, cf. James 2:10), you can’t do any of this stuff small.
<br /><br />“Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,” And when you want to be bad – because you either don’t know any better or don’t see yourself as having a choice – all the choices you make based on morals, which unlike ethics aren’t inherent in the nature of a system, are easy to make based on what will either give you the greatest pleasure or the least pain.  And those who make choices by THEIR morals of course despise those who make choices based on a higher standard, on God’s standard.  Not for nothing does Jesus make the point that the world will hate you because it hated Him first.  (Read John 15, the whole thing.)  You and I need to curb our first response to what we don’t understand – hatred – and be willing to admit, YES, we need a higher standard than one we can come up with.  Something the moralistic therapeutic deists in us will be filled by.
<br /><br />Your friend, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />[I have to share this.  On my way to work this morning I swerved in the road – I must have hit something going faster than I thought – and ended up on my driver’s side wheels with the others on a snow bank for about twenty feet.  It felt as though I’d tip over and mangle the drivers’ side of our van along with yours truly when the van righted itself, almost as though it was pushed back on all fours, on the road.  Hallelujah, I am convinced God is not finished with me yet!  And now to today’s devotion … – David]  
<br /><br />Moralistic therapeutic deism.  When I noticed a Facebook friend’s status last month citing this as what Christianity seems to have become in the United States, it struck me hard.

Based on interviews with about three thousand teenagers, MTD was congealed as the common religious belief system among American youth.  I see where they’re coming from.  
<br /><br />“Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God:” Once again, this is nothing new.  Paul’s second letter to Timothy written in about the late sixties of the first century continues its third chapter with verse four.  While I certainly don’t mean to disparage (I’d say “diss” therapy, but I’m not street enough to pull it off) therapy in the sense of physical rehabilitation – my wife’s dealing with some of this now – I question the effectiveness of going to see someone every time you feel out of sorts in your mind.  In one of my favorite movie quotes, the antagonist says that normal is what everyone else is and you’re not.  And whenever we interact with people we run the risk of comparing ourselves to what we perceive is better about their lives.
<br /><br />But that’s where all unhappiness comes from, comparison.  And when we’re unhappy – it doesn’t take a late-night advertiser to convince us of this – it’s easy to focus on what is wrong and people, well-intentioned people, demonically inspired people (oh yeah, there’s them too) who know what buttons to push on you that will convince you that you need help!  Need “help” and not need God.  Consider the people we both know today who seek validation, reasons to believe what they already believe, rather than truth; oh, they and we may couch their or our request in different words than the lawyer who got a response to “who is my neighbor” with Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37), but we tend to like hearing and are more likely to do what sounds good or easy to us.     
<br /><br />“Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”  And it is far easier to criticize than it is to govern.  Or to put in Christian terms, it is far easier to point out what is wrong with the world – and there’s plenty – than it is to do something about it, even as far as our own houses go.  Oh, we go to church, we hear the Word of God but do we really do what He is teaching us?  Are we building our houses, literally and figuratively, on a rock, a firm foundation?  Matthew 7:24-27 closes with this teaching, to not only hear what Jesus the Son of God says but also do it and we can stand up as “the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon [our] house” because we ultimately don’t depend on our own efforts.
<br /><br />“For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women with sins, led away with diverse lusts,” It sounds counter-intuitive to make the effort yet not depend upon that effort to save us, doesn’t it?  But that’s exactly what Jesus is saying and has said through those who are truly His followers for the last two millennia plus.  This may come out terribly sometimes – it’s certainly not therapeutic in the sense of it makes you feel better about yourself that you’re a sinner who can be saved by the grace of God – but sometimes we need that.  We need that for if we can’t face ourselves as we are and make the effort to improve ourselves, it won’t be worth it.  Perhaps instead of therapy we need mercy, on ourselves and to show others.  For the neighbor, to answer the lawyer’s question, was the one who had mercy on another.  So let us go do likewise.

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          18 February 2011
<br /><br />“My dear children, I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ.”  Bet you didn’t know that Charles Dickens, the author of “A Christmas Carol”, “A Tale of Two Cities”, and “Oliver Twist” among other works also wrote a biography of Jesus.  I didn’t know either until recently, and for a work that originally wasn’t intended to go beyond Dickens’ own family, it’s a good read.  It seems that after the author’s own death in 1870, the manuscript of “The Life of Our Lord” remained in the family through the life of Dickens’ sister-in-law and then his youngest child with the admonition that it not be published while any child of Dickens lived.  Just before Christmas 1933, his last child died and a majority between his widow and own children elected to have the story published.
<br /><br />“For everybody ought to know about Him.”  What is the story I’m telling my own family about our Lord Jesus Christ?  I don’t mean by the words I say – though the Gospels are a great starting point – but by what I do.  Dickens’ own eight children ranged from four to twelve when he first set pen to paper with “The Life of Our Lord” from 1846 to 1849.  And it’s not like he wasn’t busy with other things at the time; “David Copperfield” was published the year after and it’s a safe bet that took a good deal of time, that and the rest of the everyday life Charles Dickens, myself, and all of us partake of, no matter what we do for a living.  It’s a stretch to expect my own kids Sarah and Jeffrey to understand yet that communion is symbolic of Jesus’ body broken and blood shed for our sins – our deliberate acts of separation from God – they see bread and wine as it is.  
<br /><br />“No one ever lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was.”  That’s just one of a handful of examples I can think of that it didn’t occur to me to question when I was a kid.  And maybe the idea of grace, the favor that comes upon us not for who we are but for Who God is when we ask Him for forgiveness, is hard to receive when you’re in range of five years old.  But you and I can be gracious; when we want to punish our children and don’t, it’s not always a sign of weakness.  (Proverbs 13:24 and 23:13-14 come to mind.) It near broke my heart the other night to hear Sarah in bed say she was sorry for her bad temper but still get disciplined anyway.  You don’t think it is tough for you as a parent to have to discipline your children (at least this is my experience) until you have to do it.    
<br /><br />“And as He is now in Heaven, where we hope to go, and all to meet each other after we are dead, and there be happy always together, you never can think what a good place Heaven is, without knowing who He was and what he did.”  I don’t want my kids to steal, I don’t want them to lie, and I don’t want them to disobey us.  But it’s important that it’s not enough to just want Sarah and Jeffrey to live as though they take God and His Word seriously just because I do.  Am I living up to the high calling God has set for me (Philippians 3:14), do I want and show as I live that I want to be God’s man where He calls me to be, where I am right now?  Any of us who take it on ourselves to write a life of Christ as Charles Dickens did, as the Gospel writers did, as anyone has and will brings their own experiences and ideas sifted through the grace of God.  Tried in the furnace.     
<br /><br />“Lord have mercy and that’s it?”  Did I say grace was hard for a kid to understand?  That came out of Jeffrey’s mouth last year and I’ve got the circumstances written down somewhere.  While we were yet (read: are still) sinners, Christ died for us.  (Romans 5:8)  But that is NOT the end of the story; if it were, our story wouldn’t really matter.  Three days later He rose from the dead, and enough witnesses in the New Testament attest to that whether you or I believe it – this sounds sacrilegious, but wait – doesn’t really matter.  It matters what we do AS A RESULT of what we believe; even if you and I don’t agree on the finer points, if we start from Jesus (that Christ has died, Christ has risen, and Christ will come again) and agree He is Who He says He is, the life of our Lord becomes something we can add to because He is living in us!  That’s mercy.     
<br /><br />Amen, 
<br /><br />David

Isaiah 18:3 
<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          11 March 2011
<br /><br />“Bloom County” was a popular comic strip in the 1980s that you can still collect in anthologies.  Pop culture fans and other people my age might remember Opus, the penguin with the absurdly large nose or Rosebud, the part basset hound part antelope.  But I’m thinking of another character, a ten-year-old boy named Michael Binkley who when he wasn’t regaling his longsuffering father with tales of the latest celebrity scandal prepared to go to bed and the atypical monster under his bed – what we ALL believed was there when we were kids – was instead the monster in his anxiety closet.  
<br /><br />I believe it was in its first appearance where the monster announced that, on behalf of all Binkley’s anxieties, he wanted to announce their plan to jump out and grab him that night!  Cue to last panel, and Binkley’s holding a baseball bat while in bed speaking today’s title.  Now in the strip, everybody’s got an “anxiety closet”; Binkley’s figures into the most story lines … I expect that’s true of us all as well, even if we don’t call it that.  Someplace we don’t like to see anything from, someplace we’ve hidden what we’re afraid of or uncertain about.  I expect no matter how old we get or how young we are, we articulate in different ways the same basic apprehension.  We fear, we fight, the future.  
<br /><br />Since nearly a third of God’s Word the Bible itself deals with prophecy – that is, a foretelling of the future revealed by God – of small events as well as earth-shaking ones, there’s certainly nothing sinful on un-Godly in wanting to know what is ahead in our lives or in the world at large.  But it’s sad that it seems to take disasters in our world to get us searching for answers or wanting to know that there is a pattern in life, not just our lives but our world itself is proceeding toward some goal, fulfilling some purpose.  Like Doc Brown from the “Back to the Future” movies, I could tell you about the future … but do you want to know?
<br /><br />“And as [Jesus] sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”  Like I said, there’s a LOT of prophecy in the Bible, and the fact that Jesus’ disciples equated His return to Earth with the end of the world bears some study.  The twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew is often called the Olivet Discourse because of where Jesus told it, and He began with warning His disciples (then and now, since we’re reading it) that many people claiming to be Him would come to deceive them (and us, for the same reason) as stated in verses four and five.
<br /><br />Maybe more people don’t read prophecy or take it seriously because it IS pretty depressing.  All this talk of wars and rumors of wars, nations rising against nations, famines and earthquakes, and people turning on each other for Jesus’ sake – that is, those who haven’t accepted Him as Lord and Savior versus those who have – is enough to keep anyone awake nights!  But before we close the book, know that this is not the end of the story for any of us.  (Continue reading.)  But since we don’t know which IS the day or hour Jesus returns and the world ends, we have to realize as Thomas Merton said that the will of God confronts us every minute.  Be anxious, but also always be prepared.
<br /><br />As I write and you’re likely reading this, the seventh most powerful earthquake ever recorded occurred in northern Japan this morning.  The resulting tsunami from that 8.9 quake has inundated that area, contributing to hundreds of lives lost and placing nations on the rim of the Pacific Ocean on high alert.  The states of Hawaii and Oregon in my own country have already been hit, I’ve heard, but no major damage.  I’m sure we’ll see spin in the next few hours and days and weeks about how this is due to our (the collective ‘we’ that I’ve always felt uncomfortable using) mistreatment of the earth itself or divine judgment from God Himself.  
<br /><br />If you see any Christians saying the latter, let me apologize to you for them now.  Yes, we are called to be stewards of the earth (“to dress it and to keep it” since Eden, per Genesis 2:15); yes, we are called to show God is merciful and that He is just (too many references to list); but we are NEVER called to turn our backs on others when they are in need, whether they choose Jesus as their Lord and Savior or not!  Just pointing out that this and more will happen, the world will get worse before it gets better – that’s not “our Father’s business” that we should be about.  You know we can do better than that, and be of more than dubious comfort to our fellow man.  We must.   
<br /><br />Amen,
<br /><br />David     
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book and I hope to be an encourager too!  If you find that I’m not or you want me to get lost, just let me know, thank you! 
<br /><br />We praise You, Lord, for this beautiful day You have given us!  Please pray with me for the peace of Jerusalem on both sides of the fence and for physical and spiritual communities around our world.  
<br /><br />Lord, we need Your strength to fight the natural disasters and human ills to ultimately treat the cause and not just the symptoms; until we who have power change, this world You have made us stewards of won’t either.  
<br /><br />Thank You, Lord, for all those in leadership and service here and abroad.  Thank You for the opportunities we have been given as well as the promise of new life through Your Son.  And may we all seek and have a blessed week!  Amen.

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          17 March 2011
<br /><br />I know at least three people here in Minot whose birthday is today.  And my nephew Patrick whom I talked about a few weeks ago was named “Patrick” because it was thought back in 1992 that he would be born today, but he came thirteen days early.  But perhaps the best-known person bearing that name lived nearly sixteen hundred years ago and he’s honored today at the patron saint of Ireland.  You’ve probably heard someone say (or at least pinch you for not wearing green) “Happy St. Patrick’s Day” or seen of worn something green for an occasion that seems like little more than an excuse to have some fun.  And sometimes we don’t even need an excuse! 
<br /><br />All that we know of Patrick’s life with reasonable certainty comes from two letters he wrote (it would be like if all we knew of Paul was from his letters, forget the book of Acts) and get this – he’s not even Irish!  He was kidnapped from Britain when he was young and escaped Ireland after six years as a slave.  Later in his life he became the bishop of a region of Ireland and due to many miracles attributed to him – driving snakes from the country – as well as his teachings – especially embodied in the shamrock, from which the Trinity was taught as different yet the same Being (e.g., God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all God, all Jesus, and all the Holy Spirit, three in one), upon his death he was canonized as a saint.
<br /><br />I’m not sure how many people recognize the religious origins of what we celebrate today.  But it occurs to me that we’ve never quite removed or at I least I haven’t seen a serious effort to remove the “Saint” (or “St.”) when we talk about … well, Saint Patrick’s Day.  Except from some older calendars, it seems to have been excommunicated from Valentine’s Day years ago.  When the last time you saw or heard someone wished a “Happy SAINT Valentine’s Day” on the fourteenth of February?  True, there’s between five and fourteen people I’ve heard who could be THE St. Valentine, but it’s this holiday that gets a not-so-rosy alternative proposed to it (sort of an anti-Valentine’s day) but not St. Patrick’s Day.
<br /><br />This is a good sign.  It suggests at least to me that Christianity in our world isn’t quite hanging on by its fingernails yet.  To eliminate any reference to God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit in our culture would require far more expurgation and far more zeal than atheists, agnostics, and outright adversaries of our Lord have yet managed.  “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall never pass away” appears three times in Scripture – in Matthew 24:35, Mark 13:31, and Luke 21:33 – and if we’re to believe the words of Jesus, they’ll never manage it.  This might sound (gasp) un-Christian of me, but I’m not getting worked into a sweat raging at our world because God and prayer is being given the heave-ho in the public square.  I disagree; it’s a person’s choice to honor and serve God or not, and from there transform the world around them.
<br /><br />That you or I may or may not take global warming, evolution, or even Christianity seriously doesn’t keep any of these ideas from exerting a most powerful influence on what we do, say, or think.  (The first two I REALLY don’t take seriously.)  Am I saying don’t pray?  Am I saying do nothing?  Of course not.  Jesus never counseled us to just stand back from life, but know that our duties to our families and friends and society have to take a back seat to serving Him.  It sounds harsh; certainly those at the end of Luke 9 one of whom asked to go bury his father and the other who asked to say farewell to the people in his house thought they were making perfectly reasonable requests.
<br /><br />But look back several verses to Luke 9:23.  “And [Jesus] said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”  I can take up my cross, perhaps not physically lift one every day, but I can handle or believe I can handle doing unto others as I’d have others do unto me (the Golden Rule, the “deny himself” part of this verse) over a lifetime.  But DAILY, every day of my life?  I’m reading that as I type this message and I have problems saying that.  For I have bad days, yes I do.  “Bad hair days” seem popular among today’s youth, but how we feel never has to determine how we act.  Jesus could have put the cup down in the garden before He was arrested, tried, and killed and HE could have been saved, but what about the rest of us?
<br /><br />What about the rest of us.  Unlike Jesus, we’re definitely not sinless, we have a broken relationship with God that needs to be restored by Someone Who never had His relationship with God broken in the first place, even though He Himself was broken on the cross.  Our new life in Christ when we choose to accept Him as Savior and Lord doesn’t end with the crucifixion but begins with the resurrection – what the whole season of Lent now on its ninth day leads up to.  But you don’t have to wait until Easter Sunday to accept the promise of God through Jesus to restore your life; you don’t need an excuse, you just need the will to do it.  The will and the choice is yours.                      
<br /><br />Happy Patrick’s Day,
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                          1 April 2011
<br /><br />APRIL FOOLS!  Though now I see some calendars refer to today as All Fools Day (perhaps that’s the polar opposite of November 1, All Saints Day) what seems to be a harmless excuse for frivolity actually originated in something … not so tragic, really.  In the late sixteenth century you wouldn’t have used the calendar we use today but rather a documentation of days, months, and years in use since Julius Caesar’s day.  The problem came when the beginning of the year wasn’t accompanied by weather appropriate to the first of January.  By the time a new calendar was imposed (yes, imposed; the new calendar was calculated and distributed by edict of a Pope Gregory, hence it’s named the Gregorian calendar) on the “civilized” world, there was a lag of ten days.  You’d go to bed on October 5, 1582 and wake up on October 15!
<br /><br />That seems simple enough to take for granted, and everyone would use this civil calendar – that’s important, as opposed to a religious calendar for calculating festivals that move throughout the year – right?  Is the Pope Catholic?  And would Protestants understandably object to the leader of what they saw then (and maybe some still do) as an apostate church telling them how to document the dates of the calendar?  Hence England and by extension all English-speaking countries not adopting the Gregorian calendar for practical reasons until the middle of the eighteenth century.  One vestige of this you’ll see is in the lifetimes of George Washington and his contemporaries; the first President of the United States was born February 11, 1732 (Old Style) and February 22, 1732 (New – Gregorian – Style).  Russia didn’t adopt the Gregorian calendar until after the Russian Revolution of the early twentieth century for the same reasons.
<br /><br />The first people to get a joke played on them in this context were literally “April Fools” because they operated on a calendar where the beginning of the year had migrated due to not changing the calendar from January 1 to April 1.  It sounds silly enough, even foolish now, pun intended.  But let’s take a look for a minute at how God regards fools; the two passages that come readily to my mind are “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” at the beginning of Psalm 14 and Jesus’ admonition “but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire” from Matthew 5:22, part of the Sermon on the Mount.  I mention they’re what comes to mind because what we can recall (even if we don’t recall the source offhand, I had to look them up in a concordance) or our first associations when we see something new – the connections we make – often determine our outlook. Personally, the calling someone a fool and being in danger of hell fire gave me the willies!
<br /><br />Does it still?  Yes, but not in the same way it used to.  I’ve noticed that people do not like having attention drawn to their own, or what we perceive as their own, shortcomings.  It goes back to where Jesus cuts to the heart of the matter in the Sermon on the Mount; it’s not enough to look good doing the right things and obeying the law (I’m talking about God’s law regarding how we treat Him as well as each other, summarized in the Ten Commandments) we have to be willing to be the same person we are when those we disagree with aren’t around.  In essence, do we do right when no one is looking?  And if not, why not?  …  Keeping the form of going to church, being a “family man” or woman or child, giving our offering, praying until drops of blood fall from our foreheads in marathons – all of that is worthless and foolish without our focus on our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ.  We can’t say there is no God, no Ultimate Judge, and acknowledge Jesus as just a good man, and He can’t be our Savior without being our Lord too.
<br /><br />Hence the preaching of the cross – that is, the Gospel message of Jesus being born, dying on the cross, and rising from the dead for the salvation of the world (all of us) – being foolishness to those who don’t know Him.  Hence God making foolish the wisdom of this world.  Hence the foolishness of God being wiser than men.  (And that’s just in one chapter of the New Testament, from 1 Corinthians 1:18, 20, and 25!)  The fact that you and I used to be fools, the fact that we’ve had to face the fact that without God we are fools, doesn’t mean we have to stay fools.  You and I went to school, you and I grew up, you and I had became an adult (eventually) and we’ve all or we will all be confronted with the choice that our eternal destination hinges on.  The only thing we’ve got to do with it is do we say yes or no?  Do we say God is the fool – the same thing as not acknowledging Him and His promise of salvation through Jesus – or do we admit we are and go from there?        
<br /><br />It’s no April Fools’ joke,
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                                    10 June 2011
<br /><br />No society makes a virtue out of personal weakness.  Indeed, if we’re honest with ourselves, what we pray for beyond material improvement (e.g. “stuff”, more money or something we think will make us fulfilled) is strength, the opposite of weakness.  It makes Paul’s proclamation, “for when I am weak, then am I strong” in 2 Corinthians 12:10 seem kind of antithetical to our ears.  On days when he comes across to me as rather arrogant, or when I do, it’s good to be reminded that I’ve got nothing to brag about myself.
<br /><br />In this chapter, we hear Paul describing a man who had a vision of the third heaven (likely himself, but Paul never mentions it) and saying it was something he should be proud of.  But to make himself this “super spiritual” person by relating what happened to him would make him unrelatable to those just starting down the Christian path.  “Visions and revelations” – I might be treading on hallowed ground here – are hardly required to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior; if they do come, then God sends them not because we deserve them but so we will act on what we’ve seen. 
<br /><br />“And lest I should be exalted above measure. . . there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me,” What Paul’s describing in verse seven could be physical, could be mental, could be spiritual, but whatever it was got in Paul’s way enough that he asked God three times to take it away.  (8) And it wasn’t; indeed, nothing is beyond God’s power to do, but this “infirmity” was something that made Paul realize he had limits.  God wants to use us greatly, but He wants to use each of us within limits.  Those infirmities we often complain of, serious as they are or may be, aren’t meant to limit our service to God but rather make us realize that without Him we can do nothing.  
<br /><br />Jesus, God’s Son, said at the passover with His disciples that He was the vine and they were the branches in John 15:5.  To function on our own in the world as Christians and human beings would be as illogical as branches trying to grow unattached to the vine or some similar root structure.  We’re deprived of nourishment and we give God no outlet for His grace to come through.  When Paul heard, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness,” that doesn’t mean Jesus’ strength wasn’t perfect already but rather that He couldn’t show through Paul in his own strength.
<br /><br />In our own strength, we can’t do a tenth – heck, we can’t do anything – of what Jesus calls us to do.  The size of the deed is not important, it’s the size of God with us Who makes any effort of ours in His name possible.  When we are weak, when we are not seeking the credit or making ourselves bear the brunt of worship and service, then we are strong in Him.  We are made perfect, complete, because we admit we’re weak.  And that’s when we’re at our strongest. 
<br /><br />Now let’s get going, 
<br /><br />David    
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book, and I hope to be an encourager too!  If you find that I’m not or you want me to get lost, just let me know, thank you!

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                                    17 June 2011
<br /><br />This was (and still is) a favorite song of mine in Sunday School!  “Father Abraham had many sons/Many sons had father Abraham/I am one of them/And so are you/So let’s just praise the Lord!”  Singing the verse was followed by raising first your right arm, then your left, then your right leg, then your left until you’ve moving in place – weird as that sounds – and singing the final chorus, the same thing you sang at the beginning!  It’s a fun and active song, and when you’re a kid you may not realize that even when you’re not sitting in the classroom being taught or doing something related to the lesson, you still are.
<br /><br />This song comes to mind as I’m reading this month through a one-month devotional, Woodrow Kroll’s “Lessons On Living From Abraham” (ISBN 0847406857).  By this time I’m just more than halfway through and I’m learning quite a bit.  Not so much what I didn’t already know – I’ve read Genesis quite a few times – but how the life of one man thousands of years ago still speaks to us and speaks to me.  And it’s drawn out a few conclusions I’d just as soon not have faced too, for the day the lesson was titled “Someone Is Watching” concerning the strife between Abram (Abraham’s name before God changed it) and his nephew Lot’s herdsmen – Genesis 13:5-7 – it struck me.
<br /><br />Under the column Reflections/Prayer Requests I wrote about “the way of peace – we don’t like it because we have to concede we may not be all the way right, and our adversary may be partly right” along with “who is watching me, [and] who cares if I stumble or not?”  I had to realize – there are so many life lessons I could draw from Abraham’s life, but I was drawn to this one especially – that I am being watched all the time.  By God.  Not in a Big Brother I’m-prepared-to-denounce-you-the-minute-you-step-out-of-line-with-the-prevailing-worldview kind of way, but in an I-love-you-and-I-so-want-You-to-be-part-of-My-life-I-sent-My-Son-to-die-for-You way.  Yes, WAY.
<br /><br />And as God is watching me even when I’m alone and I’m typing this letter to you, God does care if I stumble or not.  Am I expected to be perfect, without fault?  The King James Version’s use of the word “perfect” comes closer to our word “complete” meaning having everything we need.  Be vewy, vewy – sorry, that’s my Elmer Fudd voice – careful not to confuse what you need (food, water, and air I’d say are the basic needs) with what you want (I really want that, but if it’s not worth sacrificing for it’s not worth having).  And if God is going to make sure we have what we need, even with a few lean years thrown in, then what’s to worry about?
<br /><br />“My God shall supply all my needs/According to His riches in glory/He shall give His angels charge over me/Jehovah-Jirah cares for me-e-e/Jehovah-Jirah cares for me.”  Another Sunday School song; Jehovah-jireh (as the KJV renders it) means “the LORD will provide.”  And that title goes back to the life of Abraham too, it’s what he named the place where he was called to sacrifice Isaac, his promised son, and at the last minute was called to stop and then sacrifice a ram God provided.  The full story’s in the first half of Genesis 24.  And if you and I believe God provides for even the sparrow, even for the grass of the field, then how much more will He provide for you and me?   
<br /><br />Even when it’s not obvious, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                          8 July 2011
<br /><br />That’s tough.  The shortest verse in the Bible, John 11:35, is also the toughest for us sometimes.  I’m looking around right now at my hometown of Minot, North Dakota, and unless you’re paying attention it’s hard to see something wrong.  Two weeks ago eleven thousand people including yours truly and his family evacuated the area surrounding the Souris River that winds through Minot and the surrounding communities.  I don’t know much about Burlington, Velva, etc. outside of what I hear on the news, but Minot’s almost cut in half by the falling floodwaters.  And I still haven’t seen my house, for the earthen dikes around my area are still high!
<br /><br />I don’t remember just what is two miles outside Minot (like Bethany was outside Jerusalem), but the fact that Jesus arrived at Bethany after His friend Lazarus died and that it so struck Him … that He wept.  Sometimes I hate having to be strong, or feeling like I do as my wife has pointed out to me a few times.  The thing is I don’t have to be.  It would be easy at this point to get into some pithy observation about Jesus as the Son of God is not only divine but also fully human, and that He had to be to understand what it’s LIKE to be one of us … but that’s crap.  Jesus didn’t and doesn’t HAVE TO BE anything; it’s the choice He made to do His Father’s will.  He wanted to.
<br /><br />Take a look with me around “Jesus wept” for a minute (though you should read the whole chapter for a great story)!  Okay, Jesus arrives at Bethany with His disciples, even though He has to know (and His disciples think He’s a little crazy for) Jerusalem close by is where His earthly enemies who want to kill Him are.  He doesn’t delay starting out from fear, but from God’s timing – to show Who He is by doing something only God can do.  (Read the story and you know what I’m talking about.)  Look back with me beginning at verse thirty-two where Mary’s coming out of the house where she’s grieving after Jesus met Martha (almost a reverse of their meeting in Luke 10:38-42, where Mary’s the one silent and Martha’s the one running about):
<br /><br />“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not [read: would not have] died.”
<br /><br />“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came unto her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,”
<br /><br />“And said, Where have ye laid him?  They said unto him, Lord, come and see.”
<br /><br />“Jesus wept.”  
<br /><br />The groaning John mentions in verse thirty-three and again in verse thirty-eight is not just a pit in Jesus’ stomach, what you and I could equate with sadness or even depression.  He was hurt – the thing about God (Jesus as the Son of God, Jesus as God) is that yes He is big (the kids’ song “God is bigger than the boogeyman” goes through my head) and He is not so big that you and I can’t hurt Him.  And often we don’t mean to, but it’s easy in our grief to try to “keep a stiff upper lip”, to believe “I am supposed to” be happy and pure and this great guy who can handle anything!  But I’m not. I weep too.
<br /><br />I’m sure Jesus didn’t worry about being behind on a home mortgage or concern Himself with being unable to get somewhere and wasn’t scared that He would work Himself to death in order to please – I think, sorry about the change to personal pronoun – the people closest to me.  But death as the big equalizer (praise God no one’s died directly as a result of this flood) no matter how we believe it floors everybody.  Our groaning in the spirit precedes the resurrection; you have to be born and you have to die in order to rise from the dead, right?
<br /><br />And we will.  Lazarus did.  Jesus did.  And I will – not necessarily three or even four days after I physically die, but ultimately I’ll be renewed where this home mortgage, this mortal coil, just the STUFF of life is what I’ll worry and concern and be afraid of no more.  1 Corinthians 10:13 refers to our not being tempted beyond what we’re able to handle … I can believe that, even if I think God’s estimate of what I can handle and mine are vastly different.  Why worry?  Why be concerned?  Why be scared?  God has worked with His people through a flood before, and this wasn’t close to worldwide!
<br /><br />He’s watching out for you and me, David
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book, and I hope to be an encourager too!  If you find that I’m not or you want me to get lost, just let me know, thank you! 
<br /><br />We praise You, Lord, for this beautiful day You have given us!  Please pray with me for the peace of Jerusalem on both sides of the fence and for physical and spiritual communities around our world.  
<br /><br />Lord, we need Your strength to fight the natural disasters and human ills to ultimately treat the cause and not just the symptoms; until we who have power change, this world You have made us stewards of won’t either.  
<br /><br />Thank You, Lord, for all those in leadership and service here and abroad.  Thank You for the opportunities we have been given as well as the promise of new life through Your Son.  And may we all seek and have a blessed week!  Amen.

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                          21 July 2011
<br /><br />At least in my experience, there are three ways in which people typically meet Ezekiel.  As an Old Testament prophet or within the book named for him, he’s usually the one “major” prophet who has to grab you by your lapels and say listen to this!  It’s no lie that the book of Ezekiel starts out with a bang; the first chapter describes the heavens opening to visions of God that Ezekiel saw by the Chebar River on the way to Babylon, a vision of “four living creatures” each with four faces and four wings that’s often confused with a long-ago UFO sighting – how I first heard about it in high school anyway.  The whole chapter covers how it looked to Ezekiel himself; it’s not until the beginning of chapter two that the LORD says anything!
<br /><br />“The word of the LORD came unto me” thirty-seven distinct times in the book, Ezekiel says.  And of all the prophecies (this is my opinion, based on my own limited knowledge) this is probably the most depressing.  For this doesn’t just deal with Judah, it deals with all the nations of the then-known world as well as nations that exist now.  But that prophecy centered in the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth chapters Ezekiel is probably not best known for.  Go back one chapter with me to Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones.  No hullabaloo, no having to trudge to get there, God just “carried [Ezekiel] out in the spirit of the LORD” and set him down in the valley where skeletons were scattered and chariots were molding.  And you thought some people fell asleep in church!
<br /><br />The LORD starts by asking Ezekiel in verse three: “Son of man, can these bones live?”  Our gut may tell us no, but try saying that to God Who created all things and can do all things.  Ezekiel answered, “O Lord GOD, thou knowest.”  Meaning it’s up to Him, as all things are that we can’t understand or comprehend now from our limited perspective in time and eternity.  Which leads to the third point where I think – again, in my own limited experience – people get introduced to this book and the prophet it’s named for between Lamentations (I was about to say Jeremiah, thank God I caught myself!) and Daniel is in a single verse.  It was the focal verse for a youth evangelism conference one year in Florida where I grew up.
<br /><br />Chapter twenty-two, verse thirty: “And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and STAND IN THE GAP before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.”  The emphasis here is mine, but how … empty that must feel, that of all the people living in a particular time and place, not one person was found who stood out enough for the Lord their GOD (make no mistake, He’s God whether you believe it or not) to possibly turn aside His wrath from the people as a whole.  Not to exterminate them whole, for God promises there will be a remnant of His people throughout the ages (especially 2 Kings 19:30-31, Isaiah 10:21-22, Ezekiel 6:8, and Romans 11:5, but there’s a lot in Scripture) who remain faithful and represent Him in our darker and darker world. 
<br /><br />“Ye are the light of the world.  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.”  Besides Jerusalem literally sitting on a hill, Jesus in Matthew 5:14 refers to you and me when we’re chosen – I know, you thought it was free will that anyone chooses to follow Jesus, but wait for it – to go out into all the world and preach the Gospel (paraphrasing the Great Commission at the end of Matthew just a bit) “baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;” if you and I are really followers of Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, we can’t not stand out in the world, like light does.  We can’t not season the world and not make it a little different for our passage through it, like salt does in the previous verse.
<br /><br />I’m looking in an online concordance (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.godsview.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.godsview.com</a>, I will cite my sources) and I find Ezekiel’s name only occurs TWICE in the book bearing his name and throughout the Bible!  I find that astonishing; the rest of the time the prophet is referred to as “son of man” ninety-three times, and not just for semantic reasons.  The fact that Jesus refers to Himself and is referred to as the Son of Man ninety times in the Bible (twice in Daniel and the rest in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, and Revelation) and you and I – that is, any individual born to a man and woman – are referred to by that title eleven times (ten in the Old Testament, once in the New) gives us not only an advocate before God the Father (1 John 2:1) but also Someone Who identifies with us.
<br /><br />I’ve often heard the Minor Prophets (Hosea through Malachi) cited as being “minor” only in terms of the length of their books, not their messages.  But to only get mentioned by name twice in a message that’s come down through thousands of years and a multiplicity of tongues … it’s a safe bet being a prophet or serving the Lord in ANY capacity was not and is not a lasting ticket to fame.  Considering some of the stuff he had to do – lay on one side for more than a year and the other side for forty days, bake bread over cow dung (a compromise God allowed him instead of baking bread over … excrement), watch his wife die and not mourn her – you can imagine doing God’s will did not and does not attract the best, most comfortable people.  It’s going to change your life and mine.  So when we ask “Why Ezekiel?” that I started this devotion with, we may as well ask why you and why me.       
<br /><br />Why you and why me, David
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book, and I hope to be an encourager too!  If you find that I’m not or you want me to get lost, just let me know, thank you!

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS                                          18 August 2011
<br /><br />Since 1998, two teachers at Beloit College have worked at and produced what they call the Mindset List, a list of pop culture references and various contributions to the worldview of their incoming freshman class, assuming they’re eighteen when they enroll. So this year’s Mindset List due out next Tuesday (find it at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beloit.edu%2Fmindset"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.beloit.edu/mindset</a>) presumes incoming students were born in 1993. After a few years, this practice caught on and is arguably “making” pop culture status of its own … besides being a warning to teachers to check their references, it’s also invaluable to advertisers or anybody who wants their message received and understood.
<br /><br />From last year’s Mindset List, for students born in 1992: Colorful lapel ribbons have always been worn to indicate support for a cause.
<br /><br />What is OUR mindset in regard to the things of God? Are we in church so much or think our Lord is only accessible through that place with the steeple or through the people seminary-educated enough (secret: I’m not) that we say it’s a waste of time, I’ll never get this? And does that mindset, even if we’re not conscious we’re broadcasting it, drive people who might normally come to church if you’d invite them, with talk of “sanctification” and “transubstantiation” and “so-and-so comes from the Hebrew-or-Greek for and such-and-such and means this-and-that”, away? Am I asking more questions today than I am admitting to having answers for?
<br /><br />Mindset: “Viewer Discretion” has always been an available warning on TV shows.
<br /><br />THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ASKING QUESTIONS. I recall no point in Scripture where God is telling anyone to follow Him blindly … the term “blind faith” is so misleading. Though God is certainly not blind and Jesus His Son, God in the flesh, walked through His life on Earth making the lame walk and the blind see among other things, He’s not going to lead you and insist “I’m right because I’m God” – that is, He’s not going to make you or me do anything against our wills. We’re asked to have faith, yes; we’re asked to believe, yes; but we’re not asked to accept something without proof. We may not recognize the proof when we see it, or it may be so abundant around us that we don’t acknowledge it. Then who is the burden of proof on? 
<br /><br />Mindset: The dominance of television news by the three networks passed while they were still in their cribs.
<br /><br />You can be a Berean and search the Scriptures for yourself (and should)! (Acts 17:10-15) You can be a Nicodemus and ask questions! (John 3) You can even be a Thomas and have doubts! (John 20:24-31; this is why I relate to Thomas most out of all Jesus’ original disciples; to me he says what everyone else is thinking.) But you MUST act on what you believe about the Person of Jesus the Christ; there is no middle ground once you’ve made the decision to take Him as Savior and Lord, or you can’t believe and not believe at the same time, do the will of God in some things and not in others and be a complete person. I once heard it expressed that Jesus is either Lord of all or He’s not Lord at all; I’ll grant you that it’s hard to FEEL fully yielded to God … heck, most of the time, but we’re not asked to act in this world based on feelings. That’s not or shouldn’t be our mindset. 
<br /><br />Mindset: We’re asked to act in this world because we love our Lord.   
<br /><br />Amen,         
<br /><br />David
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book, and I hope to be an encourager too!  If you find that I’m not or you want me to get lost, just let me know, thank you!

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS 7 October 2011
<br /><br />Lord, is it wrong to say I love my new laptop computer?  Of course it's OUR computer (me, my wife Martha, our daughter Sarah and son Jeffrey) and we all use it for different things -- Martha and I to check email and credit union statements and pay bills, me to write this and other missives some of you may find edifying, Sarah and Jeffrey under our watchful care to play games -- but it's a great tool.  Like any tool you have to use it for what it's intended for (I would say to communicate, but maybe you have other ideas) otherwise it's useless.
<br /><br />Our lives are useless without the right intention that becomes action.  That sounds like I'm turning Benjamin Franklin's maxim that the road to hell is paved with good intentions on its ear, but hear me out ...  if all you're doing with your life is just spectating (I know that's not a word!) instead of doing something with what you know, you can still get to heaven but it's going to be am empty interval between now and then. It's tempting to drag out a message from the book of James regarding works as proof of your salvation -- reasoning that prompted Martin Luther to propose excising it from the Bible when he translated it into German! (I bet my Lutheran peeps did NOT know that.)
<br /><br />But as I type this out on a Compaq Presario CQ56, Jesus' words to His disciples at the passover come to mind. (NOT the &quot;Last Supper&quot;; we know that as the title of the Leonardo da Vinci painting, but since He promised to drink the wine symbolizing the new testament -- hence that section of the Bible's name -- with the disciples in heaven per Matthew 26:29, supper's still on the table!) From His monologue in John 15: &quot;I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&quot; Verse five that I've quoted there says for me and I assume anyone who knows anything about plants that without being rooted, we can't do anything.
<br /><br />Fact of the matter is, we don't have a choice about it.  Perhaps you've heard that you're an example; whether you're a good one or a bad one is up to you.  I'm confronted with that choice, whether to hold my tongue or not, visit that website or not -- this week I was telling someone I felt like I was born in the wrong century, make that commitment or not.  We have little to no control over the consequences of our actions, but we do have control over what we do.  And if we choose to NOT act in a manner pleasing to God -- that is, &quot;abide not in me&quot; per John 15:6 -- the alternative is ultimately simple.  &quot;If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.&quot;
<br /><br />Yow!  I read that verse and it sounds to me that if you don't use your talents, you will lose them and be cast out (&quot;withered&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> and even your fellow men and women will have no regard for you.  Matthew 25's parable of the talents has nothing on this, methinks ... &quot;men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.&quot;  Pretty final, even if Jesus is not talking about death and hell (which He is).  Don't get me wrong, you can still live not using your talents -- certainly the master in the parable of the talents didn't kill the servant who didn't use his one talent, he only gave it to someone who WOULD use it -- but it's hardly the abundant life Jesus died and rose again for us to have, is it?
<br /><br />Well?  Is it?
<br /><br />David 
<br /><br />P.S. I write this weekly devotional to keep in touch with all of you in my address book, and I hope to be an encourager to action too!  If you find that I'm not or you want me to get lost, just let me know -- thank you!

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS 13 October 2011
<br /><br />I find myself thinking this week of the opening line from A Tale of Two Cities.  &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;  This week on the calendar happens for me to have two birthdays (my sister Margaret's Monday and her daughter my niece Breanna's today) and one deathday -- well, we all know what a birthday is, the anniversary of the day someone is born.  But someone's deathday is more often than not much easier to pinpoint because we tend to remember where we were when we heard the news (e.g. &quot;Where were you when you heard about the planes flying into the Twin Towers?&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />; in my case, I was watching TV while Martha worked at Kmart and Sarah was asleep in her crib at our apartment in southeast Minot when I got a call from Florida.  It was my stepmother Susan telling me my dad -- her husband -- has just died.  Today, five years ago.
<br /><br />I.  Miss.  My.  Dad.  So.  Much.  
<br /><br />I know as a Christian I'm not supposed to believe in reincarnation (and I don't anyway, for to me that accuses God of a lack of imagination; besides, aren't you not supposed to remember you were someone else<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />, but there are moments looking at my four-year-old son Jeffrey and his mannerisms that I can't help but see not just me in him -- and actually right now that's getting to be less and less -- but my dad in him. 
<br /><br />I recall a line from the poet Wordsworth, &quot;The child is father to the man&quot; and wonder sometimes whether now it's MY job to raise him.  Sometimes I can imagine that I am being like my dad who'd be eighty-five today in regard to what I do or see something my dad would do in my son or me -- especially when I don't expect to.  But Jeffrey is not going to become my dad, I am not going to become my dad; nobody is.  And that's for the best, that we can be like someone else (or not) but we can't BE someone else.
<br /><br />&quot;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:&quot; Hebrews 9:27 begins to tell us what is evident to any one of us with a working brain -- if you have been born, you're going to die.  But just as we're going to die, continues verse twenty-eight: &quot;So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.&quot;  
<br /><br />So Jesus came to Earth and died too, to do the one thing He could not do in heaven.  Die.  But it's death with a purpose none of us can fulfill; &quot;to bear the sins of many&quot; it makes sense to be without sin -- without separation from full fellowship with God our Father -- doesn't it?  And none of us are like that, without some part of ourselves that isn't fully in tune with God's will and way for our lives.  We need someone sinless to stand in for us, someone we can &quot;look&quot; -- in modern words, eagerly wait -- for to take the penalty of sin for us.
<br /><br />&quot;For the wages of [that is, what you're paid or given in return for] sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;  Romans 6:23 tells us and the Bible is replete with examples you and I can relate to of our all-too-human need for a Redeemer, someone to take the consequences for us that we can't bear.  Even if we see God as separate and unconcerned for us now we can only imagine a shadow of what hell is like, where separation from God is forever.  No, not forever.  ETERNAL.  
<br /><br />I say &quot;we&quot; because sometimes I have doubts, sometimes I have fears that I'm not only not living up to God's plan for my life -- the part of it I can see, anyway -- but that I'm also not living up to the best I know I can do.  &quot;Faith Of My Fathers&quot; is a great hymn, but it's misleading because I can't live by my father's faith in God and trust in Jesus for his eternal salvation.  Jeffrey can't live by mine (nor can Sarah, but I'm tracing the male line today), it has to be his own choice.  My own choice.  Everyone's own choice to, in the words of another hymn, &quot;trust in Jesus, and to take Him at His Word&quot; that He is the sacrifice for our sin, the cost for restoring us to fellowship with God our Father, forever.  We need to accept that sacrifice, right now. 
<br /><br />Amen,
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS 4 November 2011
<br /><br />WORD COUNT: 7,418
<br /><br />As you can tell from the line beneath the title, it's that time of year again for me -- fulfilling my every November goal of pounding out a 50,000 word plus story for possible future publication within thirty days or less.  You might think it's a silly goal, even a stupid one (go ahead, tell me that to my face, I've heard both extremes) but if you have the talent to do something and do it well, then what disservice are you doing others if you don't use your talent.  Sometimes it's even to let off a little steam ... nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't seek to stand out for its own sake.  Have a reason to redeem the day and not just seize it.
<br /><br />This devotional comes to mind as a result of what I heard Jonas Nelson, one of the regular announcers on Minot's local Christian radio station KHRT, say regarding what he and his family do on Halloween.  Understand first that Christians and Halloween are generally not the best of friends, and I expected a tirade on the order of &quot;I'm-so-righteous-because-I-have-nothing-to-do-with-it&quot;, and for many years he and his family would shut off the lights and close the blinds on Halloween because they wanted nothing to do with a pagan holiday.  (Never mind the non-Christian elements and associations of Christmas and Easter, but I digress.)
<br /><br />Some time later, Jonas and his family began to open their door to trick-or-treaters and would give out candy ... and a Gospel tract!  Some of them present the message of salvation through Jesus in very creative, visual ways; I'm recalling a cartoon where the homeowner gave a little boy dressed as a clown along with a jawbreaker the story of Jesus and the story ends with the child accepting Christ as his Savior and saying one more thing: he can't get sick from having too much Jesus!  Nor can we, but I will concede that we who claim to be followers of Jesus can often present Him in a ... less than appealing way.
<br /><br />How do we solve that?  Perhaps because our own culture places such a value of seizing the day and the time (even most people who have no grasp of Latin are familiar with the phrase carpe diem, &quot;seize the day&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, that is what we also need to do as people of faith.  (Not &quot;Christians&quot;, I'll explain why in a minute.)  It's not enough to just produce, say, a Christian-themed version of a popular TV show or movie or book, it has to be something with the potential to TRANSFORM the culture around it.  I'm reminded of a graphic novel editor who once said that good writing makes you think, [and] great writing changes the way you think.
<br /><br />Is my own writing particularly great?  I'm not the best person to judge that, methinks ... and while my writing may ultimately make some small contribution to changing our culture for the better, that shouldn't be my goal.  Or any of ours -- there's really no way of knowing (unless you're God) which seed is going to be cast into the side of the road, onto rocks, among thorns, or good ground (Jesus explaining in the parable of the sower the four types of people who hear about God in Matthew 13:18-23).  And anyone familiar with plants will tell you seeds themselves aren't alive, but they have the power to become living things.
<br /><br />So do we.  But aren't we alive already, you may be asking me?  Yes, but until we're willing to act upon the world around us (what I would call seizing the day), what good is it to be drawing your breath?  And if you're not doing something, it's a safe bet that someone is using the energy and ability you would use in a way you might not like.  We can be afraid, we can feel lacking in ability, we can feel a thousand different things ... but those are just feelings, and we can act and are called to act and dispel them.  Our Lord and our God would rather we try and fail every day than never try at all!
<br /><br />&quot;The thief [Satan in Christian belief, but I would say ANYTHING that we let sap us of our full potential] cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I [Jesus] am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot;  John 10:10 takes our living in this world one step further; we're not just called to live for the Lord, we're called to transform it, to be the light of the hill that can't be hidden!  More abundantly ... how do we succeed at that?  How does God succeed with those of us who believe -- by redeeming us!  So today, redeem the day.  Take carpe diem one step further, and make the day, YOUR day, what would please God the most, and don't worry about doing it perfect.  Just do it, 
<br /><br />Redeem the day, 
<br /><br />David

<br /><br />Thank You, Lord, that we can come to you in prayer and that You provide for all our needs, even when we don't know what they are.  We pray for the peace of Jerusalem on both sides of the fence there and around the world. 
<br /><br />Thank You, Lord, for everyone in leadership and service, both here and abroad.  Thank You for the opportunities we have and the promise of new life through You.  I pray that we all seek and have a blessed week! Amen.

<br /> 
<br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS 16 December 2011
<br /> 
<br />“The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.”  The book of Isaiah wins hands down for most-quoted Old Testament book in the New Testament, and certainly no one – no Jews, anyway – in Jesus' time upon earth questioned its authorship.  Today some people seem to, but is there merit in what they're saying?
<br /><br />In every Bible I've ever read, there's only one book of Isaiah, named for the Judean prophet of the late eighth century B.C. and nestled between the Old Testament books Song of Solomon and Jeremiah.  One book, yes, but a competing view since the late eighteenth century has presented the book as being written by two, possibly three authors.  But there are a few problems with this.
<br /><br />First (perhaps I should say last, since it's not the most important reason in my eyes), critics cite a difference in writing styles between two sections of the book of Isaiah, going with chapters 1-39 as being written by the man himself and 40-66 (actually, some sources break THIS up into chapters 40-55 and 56-66) from someone else's hand.  Even assuming that as true (Isaiah did write over several decades) here's my issue:
<br /><br />12-16-81
<br /><br />Today I had hot lunch.  It was beans &amp; franks, corn, cole slaw, rolls, cookie, &amp; milk.  We had hamburgers for dinner.  See you tomorrow!
<br /><br />I'd like to think my writing has improved or at least changed in the thirty years since I wrote that in a diary.  (I just turned forty this past Sunday.)  And likewise with Isaiah … or even you if you do a lot of writing.  Our time between the ages of ten and forty, physically in my case or spiritually in the case of Isaiah and me, can teach us a lot.  And we learn to express ourselves better, even on subjects as far apart as Assyria and Babylon.
<br /><br />But hey, maybe they're not that far apart … second, Isaiah from a scholarly standpoint (I'm not trying to be patronizing here, but we're in a society that teaches us to be critical of everyone and everything) wouldn't make sense if more than one author wrote it.  A philosophical argument popularly known as Occam's Razor says the idea that makes the fewest new assumptions is most likely true.
<br /><br />I didn't hear of this idea – that is, that Isaiah had more than one author – until university (where you hear a lot of things that just aren't true if you take five minutes to investigate them), it just seemed simpler that the book of Isaiah was written by one person; the same guy wrote down what he said from “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given” (9:6) to “Seek ye the LORD while he may be found” (55:6).
<br /><br />First and as far as I can tell foremost, Jesus and His disciples certainly didn't see a difference among the different parts of Isaiah.  In Luke 4 when Jesus is brought to the book of Isaiah in a Nazareth synagogue, “he had opened the book, [and] he found the place where it was written,” what we now know as the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah, where the Spirit of the Lord anointed Him to preach deliverance to the captives among other things.
<br /><br />Jesus cites the prophecies of Isaiah when he explains why He teaches in parables (Isaiah 6:9-10 in Matthew 13:14-15) and the Gospel authors cite Isaiah when they explain Jesus' coming and deeds on Earth as fulfillment of prophecy (especially in John 12:37-40, first “Lord, who hath believed our report?” from Isaiah 53:1 and then “He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; ...” from Isaiah 6:9,10).  
<br /><br />So why don't we want to keep it simple?  It really is easy to accept just one Isaiah, the simplest and not the simple-minded path, just as it's easiest for us – when we really want to – to accept one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.  Snuck in Ephesians 4:5 just to see if you're paying attention … none of us are so broke we can't do that, especially at Christmas.  Merry Christmas everybody. 
<br /><br />Happy Birthday Beethoven!

<br /> 
<br />AN ENSIGN ON THE MOUNTAINS 27 Kislev 5772
<br /> 
<br />I'm not rebelling against Christmas, I'm not … as thorough-going as some people I know about the Advent Conspiracy, but let's take a few minutes this year and honor a tradition that makes our celebration of Christmas possible.  And today's title is just one of variety of names this holiday – actually a series of nine days – enjoys, including the Feast of Dedication (pay attention to this one) and the name it's known as by most English speakers, translated as Hanukkah, Chanukah, Chanukkah, or Chanuka.  Here's the explanation given on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chabad.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.chabad.com</a> regarding Hanukkah – I could use my own words, but I truly don't want to miss something:
<br /><br />“On the 25th of Kislev in the year 3622 from creation, the Maccabees liberated the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, after defeating the vastly more numerous and powerful armies of the Syrian-Greek king Antiochus IV, who had tried to forcefully uproot the beliefs and practices of Judaism from the people of Israel. The victorious Jews repaired, cleansed and rededicated the Temple to the service of G-d. But all the Temple's oil had been defiled by the pagan invaders; when the Jews sought to light the Temple's menorah (candelabra), they found only one small cruse of ritually pure olive oil. Miraculously, the one-day supply burned for eight days, until new, pure oil could be obtained. In commemoration, the Sages instituted the 8-day festival of Chanukah, on which lights are kindled nightly to recall and publicize the miracle.”
<br />Remember, by the Jewish calendar today's the twenty-seventh of Kislev, so tonight's the third night of this celebration and commemoration.  (And this year's the 2150th anniversary of this time, so it dates back to 139 BC.)  Why is this, or should it be, so important to Christians today?  It was important to Jesus, born and raised as a Jew (per the begats in Matthew 1) and certainly being familiar with the passover would have also by default made Him familiar with, and honoring, Hanukkah.  Jesus is even in Jerusalem during the “feast of the dedication” in the winter before dying on the cross (John 10:22).  
<br />It's not miracles – in the words of Augustine, miracles are not contrary to nature but rather contrary to what we know of nature – that set Christianity apart from any other faith or you and I apart as followers of Jesus as the Christ from any other believers.  The oil that would have, should have by any known physical law lasted one night lasted for nine.  The food that would have, should have by any known physical law fed one little boy one meal fed more than five thousand.  Besides Jesus' resurrection, it's the one miracle of His recorded in all four Gospels (in Matthew 14, Mark 6, Luke 9, and John 6).    
<br /><br />But miracles are so not the issue here, though this season we honor them.  For Christians, it's God the Timeless inserting Himself into time, taking on our human nature and living a sinless life so that we may live that way too.  For Jews … here you'll have to talk to someone who knows more about Judaism than I do.  But that's ok, for when Jesus is saying “be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” in Matthew 5:48, He is thankfully not saying I have to know everything.  It's a question of what we do WITH what we know, what we dedicate ourselves to.  And who this year, for the opportunity to receive fellowship with God.
<br /> 
<br />Merry Christmas (and happy Hanukkah),
<br /><br />David
