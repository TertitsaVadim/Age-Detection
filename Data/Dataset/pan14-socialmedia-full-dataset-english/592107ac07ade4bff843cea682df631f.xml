<br />Has ever looked this good to me
<br />He tells me about his night
<br />And I count the colors in his eyes
<br /><br />He'll never fall in love
<br />He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
<br />I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
<br />And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
<br />He tells a joke, I fake a smile
<br />But I know all his favorite songs
<br /><br />And I could tell you
<br />His favorite color's green
<br />He loves to argue
<br />Born on the seventeenth
<br />His sister's beautiful
<br />He has his father's eyes
<br />And if you ask me if I love him
<br />I'd lie
<br /><br />He looks around the room
<br />Innocently overlooks the truth
<br />Shouldn't a light go on
<br />Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long
<br />And he sees everything black and white
<br />Never let nobody see him cry
<br />I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine
<br /><br />I could tell you
<br />His favorite color's green
<br />He loves to argue
<br />Born on the seventeenth
<br />His sister's beautiful
<br />He has his father's eyes
<br />And if you ask me if I love him
<br />I'd lie
<br /><br />He stands there, then walks away
<br />My God, if I could only say
<br />I'm holding every breath for you
<br /><br />He'd never tell you
<br />But he can play guitar
<br />I think he can see through everything but my heart
<br />First thought when I wake up is
<br />My God, he's beautiful
<br />So I put on my make-up
<br />And pray for a miracle
<br /><br />Yes, I could tell you
<br />His favorite color's green
<br />And he loves to argue
<br />Oh, and it kills me
<br />His sister's beautiful
<br />He has his father's eyes
<br />And if you ask me if I love him...
<br />if you ask me if I love him...
<br />I'd lie

<br />In the field behind your yard
<br />You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
<br />And sometimes we don't say a thing
<br />Just listen to the crickets sing
<br />Everything I need is right here by my side
<br />And I know everything about you
<br />I don't wanna live without you
<br /><br />I'm only up when you're not down
<br />Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
<br />It's like no matter what I do
<br />Well you drive me crazy half the time
<br />The other half I'm only trying to let you know
<br />That what I feel is true
<br />And I'm only me when I'm with you
<br /><br />Just a small town boy and girl
<br />Livin' in a crazy world
<br />Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
<br />And I don't try to hide my tears
<br />My secrets are my deepest fears
<br />Through it all nobody gets me like you do
<br />And you know everything about me
<br />You say that you can't live without me
<br /><br />I'm only up when you're not down
<br />Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
<br />It's like no matter what I do
<br />Well you drive me crazy half the time
<br />The other half I'm only trying to let you know
<br />That what I feel is true
<br />And I'm only me when I'm with you
<br /><br />When I'm with anybody else, it's so hard to be myself
<br />Only you can say
<br /><br />That I'm only up when you're not down
<br />Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
<br />It's like no matter what I do
<br />Well you drive me crazy half the time
<br />The other half I'm only trying to let you know
<br />that what I feel is true
<br /><br />And I'm only me
<br />Who I wanna be
<br />Well, I'm only me when I'm with you

<br />It's all because,
<br />I waited for so long, you showed me you were the one,
<br />I gave you my heart, right from the very start so,
<br />Every time you lied, I knew inside,
<br />Get another chance, I was hurting, I was broken
<br />I stayed to long and so that's why, you didn't think that I'd move on,
<br /><br />(Chorus)
<br />It's all because, I loved you, (because) I held you, (because) I believed you,
<br />You're not what I needed, (because) I'm stronger,
<br />(Because) I'm better, (because) without you, you'd thought I'd be in pieces,
<br />Because (you thought I'd be in pieces), because, I loved ya, (because) I loved ya, (because) I loved ya
<br /><br />(Verse 2)
<br />You gave me, just one thing, but taking from the beginning
<br />You left me, a heart ache, how much more could I take,
<br />With every alibi, that made me cry, I'd still give you more,
<br />I should've given up, when I had had enough,
<br />But I stayed too long, that's why, you didn't think that I'd move on,
<br /><br />(Chorus)
<br /><br />(Verse 3)
<br />I made a mistake of giving me to you,
<br />I made a mistake of loving you x4

<br />A time I now remember,
<br />I find a thought simply of you,
<br />Of that one week in September.
<br /><br />Our wandering eyes met,
<br />I fell for your cheeky grin,
<br />And without hesitation,
<br />Babe, you let me in.
<br /><br />For a week we laughed,
<br />You were so different to me,
<br />We became very close,
<br />So unlike the most.
<br /><br />Little did I get to see,
<br />That you had fallen hard,
<br />A couple months earlier,
<br />For a girl that was not me.
<br /><br />You didn't speak her name,
<br />So how was I to know?
<br />Of the hurt I would endure,
<br />Yet I couldn't bare to show.
<br /><br />You promised me we'd meet again,
<br />I waited months for you,
<br />And in the time,
<br />I was just the girl who had no clue.
<br /><br />You hurt me babe,
<br />You broke your promise,
<br />But you are a good guy,
<br />I just miss you
