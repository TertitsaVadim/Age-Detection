<br /><br />The largest branch of the Heilong River, Songhua River is 1,840 km long and has a drainage area of 540,000 sq km. The Songhua River valley is densely covered by mountains and virgin forests adl is the largest forest region in China. The Songhua River basin's fertile land makes it abundant in beans, corn, Chinese sorghum, wheat, and other agricultural products. In addition, the Songhua River is rich in mineral resources and has one of northeast China's major freshwater fish farms. The Songhua River is cold in winter and is frozen for five months out of the year. But the stretch at the Fengman Hydro- electric Power Station is an exception. Because water exiting the station is higher in temperature, steam rising from the river forms clusters of ice flowers on the tree branches and leaves along the river. For 10 km, there is a world of beautiful ice creations. The Songhua River is famous for its scenery of frost- covered plants.

In the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 A.D.), people started to build temples in mountainous areas of today's Wutai County. There are now a total of 76 temples on the mountain, ranking first in China. Temple construction has not stopped dirking the past 1,900 years. Some call it the Temple Village. Missing one or two temples is to be expected, even after visiting them one by one.

<br /><br />The Yellow River, the second longest river in China, originates at Mount Yagradagze in the far west of the country, winding from north to south and flowing east for 5,464 km until it reaches the sea. Lying in approximate latitudes to the states of Virginia, Kansas, and Nevada in America, and countries like Greece and Turkey in the West, the Yellow River drains a basin of 745,000 sq km, nourishing 120 million people. Chinese civilization emerged in the Yellow River basin and Chinese people often call the basin the &quot;cradle of Chinese civilization.&quot; Named after the muddiness of its water, the Yellow River is the most heavily silt-laden river in the world.
<br /><br />Divided into three stages, the Yellow River has both interesting geography and history. In the upper reaches, the river runs through a large but thinly populated mountainous area; in the middle reaches, the river passes through the Loess Plateau-the primary source of sediment-and carries the silt downstream.
<br /><br />When passing from mountain regions to the that plain, the river descends from an altitude of 4,575 m above sea level at the source to 1,000 m at Hekouzhen and 400 m at Zhengizhou, the capital city of Henan Province; in the lower reaches, the river channel is much higher than the surrounding land, forming an above-ground river. The Yellow River has been the most difficult river to lame in China. The history of the Yellow River civilization is the history of taming the river. For visitors, the roaring torrent is another attraction of the Yellow River.

<br /><br />The Tarim River in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is the longest continental river in China. From west to east, the river traverses a great desert, with a total length of 2,179 km and a drainage area of 198,000 sq km. nicknamed the &quot;wild horse without reins,&quot; the Tarim River has its source in the meltcd snow from Mount Tianshan and the Kunlun Mountains, combined with its three tributaries, the AkSu, Hotan and Yarkan Rivers. The lower reaches of the Tarim River have run dry for many years because of environmental degradation. The clear water and the green corridor consisting of a vast stretch of poplars are now only memories. Fortunately, some parts of the Tarim River are beginning to ruri again after years&quot; of' efforts in ecological improvement.

		<document id="27ac517d4a07222db1f1717745d3828a" url=""><![CDATA[The Wei, Jin, and Southern & Northern Dynasties (220-589<br/><br/><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184530840_1991831_49834836.jpg" /></span>
<br /><br />After the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty, China was divided for 360 years, apart from temporary reunification by the Western Jin Dynasty (265-317). It was not until 581, when the Sui Dynasty was established, that China became a unified empire again. 
<br /><br />The chronic warfare and calamities of this period caused a general turning to religion. Large numbers of temples were built and extensive grottoes were excavated, and these works gave wide scope to mural painters. The Kizil Grotto in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Mogao Grottoes in Gansu Province are renowned all over the world for their murals painted during the Northern Dynasties period (386-581). They mostly have Buddhist themes, stressing the ideas of transmigration from the &quot;'bitter sea of life,&quot; and putting up with humiliation in this world to become a Buddha in the next poignant indications of the sufferings of the people of the time. 
<br /><br />Although tomb murals remained as popular as they had been in the Han Dynasty, the turmoil in the Central Plains resulted in an exodus of the rich and noble, and so few large tombs were built. The tombs with lavish murals built during the Wei, Jin and Northern Dynasties are found in remote areas of the northwest and northeast, and even in neighboring Korea.
<br /><br />In the course of this prolonged social turbulence the Confucian school lost its grip as the national ideology, and the literati tended to become liberal in their philosophical reasoning. This gave rise to many new trends in the art of painting: There were more art works expressing personal feelings, the styles of expression tended to be diversified and the painting techniques were further developed. Professional painters, art critics and connoisseurs all appeared in this period.
<br /><br />Figure paintings were still the major type of painting, but artists had already begun to pay attention to expressing the inner feelings of the figures. Landscapes and flower-and-bird paintings were in transition from being parts of figure paintings to being independent subjects of paintings themselves.

<br /><br />The Yuan Dynasty was established by the Mongols in the early 13th century, following their conquest of the Western Xia, Jin and the Southern Song powers. In the early stage of the consolidation of the dynasty, the Mongols discriminated against the old Han officials, and many of the latter retired to live in seclusion. The ones who served the new regime, finding few outlets for their talents as administrators, turned their energies to poetry and painting. The &quot;'hermits,&quot; represented by Qian Xuan (1239-1301) and Gong Kai, produced a number of outstanding works of painting, as did the &quot;'officials,&quot; represented by Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), Gao Kegong (1248-1320), Li Kan (1244-1320), and Ren Renfa. Mastering the best artistry of both the Tang and Song dynasties, they pursued a refined style stressing elegance, and applied calligraphic techniques to painting for better expressiveness. 
<br /><br />In the mid- and late Yuan Dynasty, there were four important and equally outstanding painters -- Huang Gongwang (1269-1354), Wu Zhen (1280-1354), Ni Zan (1301-1374) and Wang Meng (? - 1385). 
<br /><br />Meanwhile, bird-and-flower painting developed from the over-elaborated style of the Song Dynasty to a natural, simple and graceful mode of depiction. Freestyle ink-wash and ink monochrome became the major form of expression in this field. 
<br /><br />The Yuan rulers believed in Tibetan Buddhism, so a large number of temple murals were painted by monk artists. The well preserved Yuan Dynasty murals in the four halls of the Yougle Palace in Ruicheng, Shanxi Province, were painted by folk artists.
<br /><br />The Yuan Dynasty is particularly noted for its outstanding portraits. Wang Yi ( 1333- <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> was well-known in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas for his lifelike portraits which reflected the true personalities of his subjects. 
<br /><br />In the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) folk artists were enlisted to paint portraits of emperors and murals in both palace and temples. In the mid-Ming Dynasty it became fashionable for emperors and other members of the imperial family to take up the paintbrush, and so imperial paintings were in vogue for a time. Leading court painters at this time were Shang Xi,Shi Rui, Li Zai, Bian Jingzhao, among others. Meanwhile, professional painters unconnected with the palace were also productive. Among these, Dai Jin (1388-1462) and Wu Wei(1459-1508) formed the Zhe and Jiangxia schools of painting, respectively.  
<br /><br />The literati tended to refrain from painting in early Ming Dynasty, preferring to take advantage of theist restoration to power and influence following the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. It did not become popular again till the mid-Ming, when a group of literati in Suzhou carried on the Yuan literati tradition, and, combining it with the Zhe School, established the Wumen (ancient name of Suzhou) School. Shen Zhou (1427-1509), Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), Tang Yin (1470-1523) and Qiu Ying were known as the 'Four Painters of the Wumen School.&quot; The Wumen School remained influential well into the Qing Dynasty. 
<br /><br />In the later part of the Ming Dynasty, the Huating School, led by Dong Qichang (1555-1636), advocated that painters should learn from the ancients and nature, while cultivating the sentiments of the literati. Moreover, Dong's proposal that the techniques of calligraphy should also be applied to painting had a strong impact on the artistic world. 
<br /><br />The last feudal dynasty in China, the Qing Dynasty, was founded by the Manchu ethnic group. As in the earlier period when the Mongols came to power in China, scholars and people connected with the imperial family preferred to live in obscurity to serving &quot;barbarians&quot; .Some became monks or nuns, or retired as hermits in the mountains. Many consoled themselves with painting.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184530840_1296939_49834886.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />The number of court painters gradually increased during the mid-Qing Dynasty. Besides doing landscapes, bird-and-flower paintings and portraits of emperors and empresses, they were also ordered to create scenes depicting important historical events and activities such as imperial expeditions, inspection tours and ceremonies. By that time, some Western painters also served at the court, and created a new trend of painting in a combination of Eastern and Western styles. In this period too, in Yangzhou, a new commercial city on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a galaxy of painters gathered. Among them there were the &quot;Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou&quot; and some well known painters of scenes of buildings.
<br /><br />In the late Qing Dynasty, painters swarmed to Shanghai as it emerged as the commercial center of China. The &quot;'Shanghai School&quot; of painting took the lead, creating a new style catering to both refined and popular tastes.

<br /><br />Traditional Chinese painting is basically the unification of rationality and irrationality; representation and presentation: the concrete and the abstract. It embodies the thousands-of-years-old bipolar thinking of Chinese philosophy with the Taoist theory of the Way as the key. This gives Chinese painting a value which will last forever. It is the theory that man is an integral part of nature, implied in landscape painting, that has made me devote myself to it.

<br /><br />The Temple of Heaven, located in the south of Beijing, is where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties used to offer sacrifices to the gods and pray for rich harvests. The emperors, who called themselves &quot;Sons of Heaven,&quot; regarded it as a solemn duty to offer sacrifices every year to both heaven and earth. The Temple of Heaven is the most outstanding of the numerous sacrificial buildings in China.

<br /><br />The Great Wall, as reconstructed in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), is located in north China, starting from the Yalu River on the border with Korea. It then extends westward through the municipalities of Tianjin and Beijing, Hebei Province, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu Province, finally reaching the Jiayu Pass, with a total length of over 5,000 km. The history of its construction covers more than 20 centuries, dating back to the spring and autumn and Warring States periods (770-221BC), and continuing through the Qin, Han, Northern Wei, Eastern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui, Liao, Jin and Ming dynasties to the 17th century. If the Great Wall were dismantled, a road 10 m wide and 35 cm thick could be built to circle the earth twice. The various difficulties of the terrain - mountain ridges, deserts, grasslands, sheer cliffs and rivers - that the builders of the Great Wall had to overcome make it one of the wonders of ancient construction feats. The Great Wall, mainly used as a defense bulwark in ancient China, is pierced with loopholes for archers, and there are watchtowers at close intervals, as well as beacon towers. Due to its great influence for a period of over 2,000 years on China's politics, military struggles and diplomatic contacts, there are many historical records as well as legends and folk tales about the Great Wall. In 221 BC, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty unified China and ordered that all the defensive walls in the north of all the previously warring states be joined and extended.

<br /><br />The Summer Palace, located in the northwestern suburbs of Beijing, was originally a resort for the emperors of the Qing Dynasty to escape the capital's summer heat. The Qingyi Garden was built in the 15th year of the reign of Emperor Qianlong (1750) by skilled craftsmen from the country at an enormous cost. Destroyed by the British and French allied forces in the 14th year of the reign of Emperor Xianfeng (1860), it was rebuilt by Empress Dowager Cixi in the 14th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1888), and its name was changed to Summer Palace.
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184530840_14665852_49927764.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />With an area of approximately 2.9 million sq m, the Summer Palace is mainly composed of the palace region, Longevity Hill and Kunming Lake, characterized by both the natural beauty of lakes and mountains and meticulously laid-out flower gardens. There are over 3,000 buildings in various styles in the park. With the Western Hills and the Jade Spring Hill as the background, the buildings merge harmoniously with the landscape, and so the Summer Palace is rated as a model of Chinese landscape art. 
<br /><br /><span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> <img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184530840_8150866_49927778.jpg" /></span> 
<br /><br />Its close connection with Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu bound the Summer Palace inseparably with the modern history of China. II was opened to the public as a park in 1924.
