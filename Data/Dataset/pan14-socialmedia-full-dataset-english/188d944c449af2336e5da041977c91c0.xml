However, instead of changing fuel sources, some automotive companies have been using a new type of transmission to improve fuel economy, lower emissions, and actually make vehicles faster without adding to the sticker price.<br /><br />These companies are using a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and instead of having set gear ratios (or gears), it constantly varies the gear ratios, as well as engine performance, so that they both operate at their most efficient level in any driving scenario.<br /><br />Because these key components of the power train are at their peak performance at all times, fuel economy is improved by 6-8% and carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 10%.<br /><br />Although these figures may not sound impressive, the gas savings increase the highway mileage of most vehicles by 4 to 6 mpg, which adds up pretty quickly at $3/gallon.<br /><br />The CVT's potential for reducing emissions is also significant.  As Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan Motor Company, said, achieving his goal of selling one million CVT equipped vehicles by the end of 2007 will have &quot;the same effect in terms of reducing CO2 emissions as selling 200,000 hybrid electric vehicles.&quot;<br /><br />Since there is no shifting between fixed gears, there is no 'shift shock' or jerking sensation, which makes them exceptionally smooth to drive.  CVTs also do well in hilly terrain since there is no 'gear hunting' or bogging down on a hill, followed by a loud, violent downshift, which also contributes to its superior acceleration.<br /><br />You may be wondering why this isn't in every car if it is so great.
