<br />&gt; 2. Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than

<br />&gt; 3. It ain't the jeans that make your butt look fat.
<br />&gt; 4. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity.

<br />&gt; 14. Junk is something you've kept for years and throw away three

<br /><br />It's that time of year to take our annual senior citizen test.
<br />Exercise of the brain is as important as exercise of the muscles. As we 
<br />grow 
<br />older, it's important to keep mentally alert. If you don't use it, you 
<br />lose 
<br />it! Below is a very private way to gauge your loss or non-loss of 
<br />intelligence.
<br />Take the test presented here to determine if you're losing it or not. 
<br />The 
<br />spaces below are so you don't see the answers until you've made your 
<br />answer.
<br />OK, relax, clear your mind and begin.
<br /><br />1. What do you put in a toaster?
<br /><br />Answer: &quot;bread.&quot; If you said &quot;toast,&quot; give up now and do something 
<br />else.
<br />Try not to hurt yourself. If you said, bread, go to Question 2.
<br /><br />2. Say &quot;silk&quot; five times. ?Now spell &quot;silk.&quot; What do cows drink?
<br /><br />Answer: Cows drink water. If you said &quot;milk,&quot; don't
<br />attempt the next question. Your brain is over-stressed and may even 
<br />overheat. Content yourself with reading a more appropriate literature 
<br />such 
<br />as Auto World. However, if you said &quot;water&quot;, proceed to question 3.
<br /><br />3. If a red house is made from red bricks and a blue house is made from 
<br />blue 
<br />bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is 
<br />made 
<br />from black bricks, what is a green house made from?
<br /><br />Answer: Greenhouses are made from glass. If you said &quot;green bricks,&quot; 
<br />why the 
<br />hell are you still reading these???
<br />If you said &quot;glass,&quot; go on to Question 4.
<br /><br />4. It's twenty years ago, and a plane is ?flying at 20,000 feet over 
<br />Germany 
<br />(If you will recall, Germany at the time was politically divided into 
<br />West Germany and East Germany.) Anyway, during the flight, TWO engines fail. 
<br />The 
<br />pilot, realizing that the last remaining engine is also failing, 
<br />decides on 
<br />a crash landing procedure. Unfortunately the engine
<br />fails before he can do so and the plane fatally crashes smack in the 
<br />middle 
<br />of &quot;no man's land&quot; between East Germany and West Germany. Where would 
<br />you 
<br />bury the survivors? East Germany, West Germany, or no man's
<br />land&quot;?
<br /><br />Answer: You don't bury survivors.
<br />If you said ANYTHING else, you're a dunce and you must stop. If you 
<br />said, 
<br />&quot;You don't bury survivors&quot;, proceed to the next question.
<br /><br />5. Without using a calculator - You are driving a bus from London to 
<br />Milford 
<br />Haven in Wales. In London, 17 people get on the bus; In Reading, six 
<br />people 
<br />get off the bus and nine people get on. In  Swindon, two people get off 
<br />and 
<br />four get on. In Cardiff , 11 people get off and 16 people get on. In 
<br />Swansea, three people get off and five people get on In Carmathen, six 
<br />people get off and three get on. You then arrive at Milford Haven.
<br />What was the name of the bus driver?
<br /><br />Answer: Oh, for crying out loud!
<br />Don't you remember your own name? It was YOU!!
<br /><br />Now pass this along to all your friends and pray they do better than 
<br />you.
<br />PS: 95% of people fail most of the questions!!

<br /><br />TO ALL THE KIDS
<br />WHO SURVIVED the
<br />1930's 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's !!
<br /><br />First, we survived being born to mothers who smoked and/or drank while 
<br />they 
<br />were pregnant.
<br />They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and 
<br />didn't get 
<br />tested for diabetes.
<br /><br />Then after that trauma, we were put to sleep on our tummies in baby 
<br />cribs 
<br />covered with bright colored lead-based paints.
<br /><br />We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and 
<br />when we
<br />rode our bikes, we had no helmets, not to mention, the risks we took 
<br />hitchhiking.
<br />As infants &amp; children, we would ride in cars with no car seats, booster 
<br />seats, seat belts or air bags.
<br /><br />Riding in the back of a pick up on a warm day was always a special 
<br />treat.
<br /><br />We drank water from the garden hose and NOT from a bottle.
<br /><br />We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and
<br /><br />NO ONE actually died from this.
<br /><br />We ate cupcakes, white bread and real butter and drank koolade made 
<br />with 
<br />sugar, but we weren't overweight because .
<br /><br />WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING !
<br /><br />We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were 
<br />back 
<br />when the streetlights came on.
<br /><br />No one was able to reach us all day.
<br /><br />And we were O.K.
<br /><br />We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride 
<br />down
<br />the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the 
<br />bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.
<br /><br />We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at 
<br />all, no 
<br />150 channels on cable, no video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or 
<br />CD's, 
<br />no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet or chat rooms.......
<br />WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found them!
<br /><br />We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no
<br />lawsuits from these accidents.
<br /><br />We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in 
<br />us 
<br />forever.
<br /><br />We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays,
<br /><br />made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, although we were told 
<br />it 
<br />would happen, we did not put out very many eyes.
<br /><br />We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or 
<br />rang
<br />the bell, or just walked in and talked to them!
<br /><br />Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who 
<br />didn't 
<br />had to learn to deal with disappointment. Imagine that!!
<br /><br />The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of.
<br /><br />They actually sided with the law!
<br /><br />These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers, problem 
<br />solvers and inventors ever!
<br /><br />The past 50 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas.
<br /><br />We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned
<br /><br />HOW TO
<br /><br />DEAL WITH IT ALL!
<br /><br />If YOU are one of them . . . CONGRATULATIONS!
<br /><br />You might want to share this with others who have had the luck to grow 
<br />up as
<br />kids, before the lawyers and the government regulated so much of our 
<br />lives
<br /><br />for our own good
<br /><br />And while you are at it, forward it to your kids so they will know how 
<br />brave 
<br />(and lucky) their parents were.
<br /><br />Kind of makes you want to run through the house with scissors, doesn't 
<br />it?!
<br /><br />The quote of the month is by Jay Leno:
<br /><br />&quot;With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, 
<br />severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, 
<br />and 
<br />with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks,&quot;Are we sure this is 
<br />a 
<br />good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?&quot;
<br /><br />For those that prefer to think that God is not watching over us....go 
<br />ahead 
<br />and delete this.
<br />For the rest of us.....pass this on.

<br /><br />Many females use a date rape drug on the market called &quot;Beer.&quot; 
<br /><br />The drug is found in liquid form and is available anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans, or from taps and in large &quot;kegs&quot;. Beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home and sleep with them. A woman needs only to get a guy to consume a few units of Beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex. 
<br /><br />Men are rendered helpless against this 
<br /><br />approach. After several beers, men will often succumb to the desires to sleep with horrific looking women whom they would never normally be attracted. 
<br /><br />After drinking beer, men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that &quot;something bad&quot; occurred. 
<br /><br />At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings, in 
<br /><br />a familiar scam known as &quot;a relationship.&quot;
<br /><br />In extreme cases, the female may even be shrewd enough to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer term form of servitude and punishment  referred to as &quot;marriage.&quot; Men are much more susceptible to this scam  after beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory females. 
<br /><br />Please! Forward this warning to every male you know.  
<br /><br />If you fall victim to this &quot;Beer&quot; scam and the women administering it,  there are male support groups where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter with similarly victimized men.  For the support group nearest you, just look up Golf Courses&quot; in the phone book.

<br />beautiful, enticing, female Poodle.
<br /><br />The three male dogs fall all over themselves in an effort to be the one 
<br />to 
<br />reach her first, but end up arriving in front of her at the same time.
<br /><br />The males are speechless before her beauty, slobbering on themselves 
<br />and 
<br />hoping for just a glance from her in return.
<br /><br />Aware of her charms and her obvious effect on the three suitors, she 
<br />decides 
<br />to be kind and tells them, &quot;The first one who can use the words 'liver' 
<br />and 
<br />'cheese' together in an imaginative, intelligent sentence can go out 
<br />with 
<br />me.&quot;
<br /><br />The sturdy, muscular black Lab speaks up quickly and says, &quot;I love 
<br />liver and 
<br />cheese.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, how childish,&quot; said the Poodle. &quot;That shows no imagination or 
<br />intelligence whatsoever.&quot;
<br /><br />She turns to the tall, shiny Golden Retriever and says &quot;How well can 
<br />you 
<br />do?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Um. I HATE liver and cheese,&quot; blurts the Golden Retriever.
<br /><br />&quot;My, my,&quot; said the Poodle. &quot;I guess it's hopeless. That's just as dumb 
<br />as 
<br />the Lab's sentence.&quot;
<br /><br />She then turns to the last of the three dogs and says, &quot;How about you, 
<br />little guy?&quot;
<br /><br />The last of the three, tiny in stature but big in fame and finesse, is 
<br />the 
<br />Taco Bell Chihuahua.
<br /><br />He gives her a smile, a sly wink, turns to the Golden Retriever and the 
<br />Lab 
<br />and says .
<br /><br />&quot;Liver alone. Cheese mine.&quot;

<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;Will I live to be 80?
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;I recently picked a new primary care doctor.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;After two visits and exhaustive lab tests, he said I was doing &quot;fairly
<br />&gt;well&quot; for my age.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;A little concerned about that comment, I couldn't resist asking him,
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;&quot;Do you think I'll live to be 80?&quot;
<br />&gt;He asked, &quot;Do you smoke tobacco, or drink beer or wine?&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;&quot;Oh no,&quot; I replied. &quot;I'm not doing drugs, either.&quot;
<br />&gt;Then he asked, &quot;Do you eat rib-eye steaks and barbecued ribs?&quot;
<br />&gt;I said, &quot;No, my former doctor said that all red meat is very 
<br />unhealthy!&quot;
<br />&gt;&quot;Do you spend a lot of time in the sun, like playing golf, sailing,
<br />&gt;hiking or bicycling?&quot;
<br />&gt;&quot;No, I don't,&quot; I said.
<br />&gt;He asked, &quot;Do you gamble, drive fast cars, or have a lot of sex?&quot;
<br />&gt;&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;I don't do any of those things.&quot;
<br />&gt;He looked at me and said, &quot;Then, why do you give a shit?&quot;

<br /><br />SUMMARY OF MY LAST YEAR OF EMAILS
<br /><br />I must send my thanks to whoever sent me the one about
<br />rat poop in the glue on envelopes because I now have
<br />to use a wet towel with every envelope that  needs sealing. 
<br /><br />Also, now I have to scrub the top of every can I open
<br />for the same reason.
<br /><br />I no longer have any savings because I gave it to a
<br />sick girl (Penny Brown) who is about to die in the
<br />hospital for the 1,387,258th time. 
<br /><br />I no longer have any money at all, but that will
<br />change once I receive the $15,000 that Bill
<br />Gates/Microsoft and AOL are sending me for 
<br />participating in their special e-mail program.
<br /><br />I no longer worry about my soul because I have 363,214
<br />angels looking out for me, and St. Theresa's novena
<br />has granted my every wish.
<br /><br />I no longer eat at KFC because their chickens are
<br />actually horrible mutant freaks with no eyes or feathers.
<br /><br />I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though
<br />I smell like a water buffalo on a hot day.
<br /><br />Thanks to you, I have learned that my prayers only get
<br />answered if I forward an e-mail to seven of my friends
<br />and make a wish within five minutes.
<br /><br />Because of your concern, I no longer drink Coca Cola
<br />because it can remove toilet stains.
<br /><br />I no longer can buy gasoline without taking a man
<br />along to watch the car so a serial killer won't crawl
<br />in my back seat when I'm pumping gas.
<br /><br />I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr. Pepper since the people
<br />who make these products are atheists who refuse to put
<br />&quot;Under God&quot; on their cans.
<br /><br />I no longer use Saran wrap in the microwave because it
<br />causes cancer.
<br /><br />And thanks for letting me know I can't boil a cup
<br />water in the microwave anymore because it will blow up
<br />in my face....disfiguring me for life.
<br /><br />I no longer check the coin return on pay phones
<br />because I could be pricked with a needle infected 
<br />with AIDS.
<br /><br />I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will
<br />drug me with a perfume sample and rob me.
<br /><br />I no longer shop at Target since they are French and
<br />don't support our American troops or the Salvation Army.
<br /><br />I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask
<br />me to dial a number for which I will get a phone bill
<br />with calls to Jamaica , Uganda , Singapore and
<br />Uzbekistan 
<br /><br />I no longer have any sneakers -- but that will change
<br />once I receive my free replacement pair from Nike.
<br /><br />I no longer buy expensive cookies from Neiman Marcus
<br />since I now have their recipe.
<br /><br />Thanks to you, I can't use anyone's toilet but mine
<br />because a big brown African spider is lurking under
<br />the seat to cause me instant death when it bites my butt.
<br /><br />And thanks to your great advice, I can't ever pick up
<br />the $5.00 I found dropped in the parking lot because
<br />it probably was placed there by a sex molester waiting 
<br />underneath my car to grab my leg.
<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget this one either! 
<br />I can no longer drive my car 
<br />because I can't buy gas from certain gas companies!
<br /><br />Happy 2007........ !!
<br />Here's to another great year of e-mailing!!!

<br /><br />Mrs. Parks, the 6th grade science teacher, asked her class, 
<br />  &quot;Which human body part increases to 10 times its size when stimulated 
<br />?&quot; 
<br /><br />No one answered until little Molly stood up, angry, and said, &quot;You 
<br />  should 
<br />  not be asking 6th graders a question like that! I'm going to tell my 
<br />  parents, and they will go and tell the principal, and you'll get 
<br />fired!&quot; 
<br /><br />She then sat back down. 
<br /><br />Mrs. Parks ignored her, and asked the question again, &quot;Which body 
<br />part 
<br />  increases to 10 times its size when stimulated?&quot; 
<br /><br />Little Molly's mouth fell open, and she said to those around her, 
<br />&quot;Boy, 
<br />  is 
<br />  she gonna get in big trouble!&quot; 
<br /><br />The teacher continued to ignore her and said to the class, &quot;Anybody 
<br />?&quot; 
<br /><br />Finally, Jimmy stood up, looked around nervously, and said, &quot;The body 
<br />  part 
<br />  that increases to 10 times its size when stimulated is the pupil of 
<br />the 
<br />  eye. 
<br /><br />Mrs. Parks said, &quot;Very good, Jimmy.&quot; 
<br /><br />She then turned to Molly and continued, &quot;As for you, young lady, I 
<br />have 
<br />  three things to say: 
<br /><br />First, you have a dirty mind. 
<br />  Second, you didn't read your homework. 
<br />  And third, one day you are going to be VERY, VERY disappointed.

<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />&gt;&gt; The family wheeled Grandma out on the lawn, in her 
<br />&gt;&gt; wheelchair, where the activities for her 100th 
<br />&gt;&gt; birthday were taking place. 
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />&gt;&gt; Grandma couldn't speak very well, but she could 
<br />&gt;&gt; write notes when she needed to communicate. After a 
<br />&gt;&gt; short time out on the lawn, Grandma started leaning 
<br />&gt;&gt; off to the right, so some family members grabbed her 
<br />&gt;&gt; straightened her up, and stuffed pillows on her 
<br />&gt;&gt; right. A short time later, she started leaning off 
<br />&gt;&gt; to her left, so again the family grabbed her and 
<br />&gt;&gt; stuffed pillows on her left. 
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />&gt;&gt; Soon she started leaning forward, so the family 
<br />&gt;&gt; members again grabbed her then tied a pillowcase 
<br />&gt;&gt; around her waist to hold her up. A grandson, who 
<br />&gt;&gt; arrived late, came up to Grandma and said, &quot;Hi, 
<br />&gt;&gt; Grandma, you're looking good! How are they treating 
<br />&gt;&gt; you?&quot; 
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />&gt;&gt; Grandma took out her little notepad and slowly wrote 
<br />&gt;&gt; a note to the grandson...&quot;They won't let me fart.&quot;

<br />&gt; stranger turned to her and said, &quot;Let's talk. I've heard that flights go
<br />&gt; quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger.&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The little girl, who had just opened her book, closed it slowly and said
<br />&gt; to
<br />&gt; the stranger, &quot;What would you like to talk about?&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Oh, I don't know&quot;, said the stranger. &quot;How about nuclear power?&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; &quot;OK,&quot; she said. &quot;That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you
<br />&gt; a
<br />&gt; question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass, the same
<br />&gt; stuff.
<br />&gt; Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty,
<br />&gt; and
<br />&gt; a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The stranger thinks about it and says, &quot;Hmmm, I have no idea,&quot;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; To which the little girl replies, &quot;Do you really feel qualified to
<br />&gt; discuss
<br />&gt; nuclear power when you don't know shit?

<br />A big city lawyer went duck hunting in rural 
<br />North Dakota. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field 
<br />on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence,
<br />an 
<br />elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. 
<br />The litigator responded, &quot;I shot a duck and it fell in this field,and now 
<br />I'm going to retrieve it.&quot; 
<br />&quot;The old farmer replied, &quot;This is my 
<br />property, and you are not coming over here.&quot; The indignant lawyer 
<br />said, &quot;I am one of the best trial attorneys in the United States and, if 
<br />you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you 
<br />own.
<br />&quot; The old farmer smiled and said, &quot;Apparently, you don't know how 
<br />we settle disputes in North Dakota. We settle small disagreements like this; 
<br />with the 'Three Kick Rule. '&quot; The lawyer asked, &quot;What is the 'Three 
<br />Kick Rule'? &quot; The Farmer replied, &quot;Well, because the dispute occurs on
<br />my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times 
<br />and so on back and forth until someone gives up.&quot; 
<br />The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that 
<br />he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local
<br />custom. 
<br />The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. 
<br />His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin 
<br />and dropped him to his knees! His second kick to the midriff sent the
<br />lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. The lawyer was on all
<br />fours 
<br />when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a 
<br />fresh cow pie. 
<br />The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to 
<br />get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said,
<br />&quot;Okay, you old fart.Now it's my turn.&quot; 
<br />(I love this part) 
<br />The old farmer smiled and said, &quot;Nah, I give up. You can have the duck.&quot;
