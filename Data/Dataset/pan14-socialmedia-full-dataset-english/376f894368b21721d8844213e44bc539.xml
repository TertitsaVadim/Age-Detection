They are celebrating some occasion know as &quot;Adat Bercukur Anak&quot;. This occasion normally when a young baby girl or male born and then are celebrate him/her welcoming in a religion way. This occasion also one of Malay culture style on welcoming new born baby. At there, I was invited to have some meal and also some chances to shave the baby head as symbol of gratitude to our God. It was great chance to try it and I'm having a great time there with my brother and his friends.
<br /><br />After going to the Kenduri, my brother friends ask me to join them to see the football match between China &amp; Malaysia. Even though we only started watching the game almost half-hour break, I was disappointed to hear that, our team was defeated by 2 goals. What the heck there are they doing?...all of us continue watching the game until its finish with high hopes that our team will win even though the game are seems not in our team side. Sadly, in the end, our team Malaysia admit total defeat to China scorer 5 to 1 goals. What a shame but what can we do. I suggest that our player need to play hard and concentrate in the game more rather than chasing the ball without any team work. Work it till its perfect and run some more aggressive training. We, as the Malaysia supporter don't want to see more defeat towards this upcoming games.
<br /><br />After watching and hang out at the Dataran Senawang Mamak Stall, we headed back to home and get some shut eyes. Sleep with a disappointed feeling and also full stomach with roti cannai plus teh tarik...hehehe!!!

I'm sort of tired from some work and seems today, I rather on bed sleeping than staring my computer for hours and hours. No mood to do anything and my mouth keep yawning and yawning. What the hell happen to me...I really don't know...
<br /><br />Wake up after a long break sleeping on my bed, surf the net for some info and digging some ideas for my brothers presentation slides template. Just found some new cool software known as Unstoppable Copier. It makes a simple data transfer from any of your CD or DVD that happen to be scratch or damage. As we know if any of those happen to be damage, the data inside normally cannot be read or copy. With this software, you can copy piece by pieces of the file inside the damage CD/DVD into your hard drive. I know its along shot, what the heck! Just try right. Hope this idea gives you some help.
<br /><br />My plan for today is to watch the new Movie &quot;Harry Porter &amp; The Order of the Phoenix&quot;. I chat with my friend last night about it, he says that the movie was great and he gives 4/5 stars for the ranking. Also best sound effect and visual effect inside the movie makes you fascinate to see them. After Transformer The Movie 2007 and came Harry Porter. Before that, Ocean 13 was also one of the best movie for this year. For me, they'll show was great. Can't wait other more movies came on this year.

I was left alone at home because my brother had to attend his Midterm Exam for this 2 days of his weekend. Real suck rite!.. Like in our campus, there will be no exam conducted during Sunday and maybe some of them are held on Saturday. Maybe the schedule is so tight with other faculty exam.
<br /><br />Relax and laying down on my floor bed inside my room doing nothing and surfing around to get some entertainment. Why does the PC Fair doesn't held on this week?..it much easier for me to go and also no need to waste my time grounded at my room. Huh!...I really want to have my new headphone rite away. Miss my mp3 player bass sound dribbling on my ears. Uwaaa!!!....Bored!!!
<br /><br />Yesterday I surf around the NFSUnlimited homepage, seems I was neglected something important about the new coming game of Need for Speed Pro Street. A cool and nice game combining all kind of NFS previous game like circuit race, drift arena and also some fast track street race. I can't wait to see it been released on this October 2007 &amp; weel known, to play it like hell. Well done again Electronics Art &amp; also EA Games. I support both of this company all the way in making new games. Click here for info.
<br /><br />For all my friends that so crazy about anime especially Bleach and Naruto, last week episode is Bleach 135 &amp; Naruto 21 is already on the torrent site. Make sure you all download as fast as you can. For another reminder, the will be no Bleach 136 episode because they say the staff is taken one week vacation from work.

We took the last shows at 11.10pm. The movie was so great and the first part is already make you want laugh like hell. But my brother said, the story line is just not enough and seems too short. But for me, to see one movie that can cheer me up and make me want to forget all my worries, this movie really hit the spot. Hehe...Nice One!
<br /><br />The next day, Tuesday, I really slept well last nite because of the cool weather and raining started at 3am, or something like that. Who else are care when the time the rain comes?...the matter is we can sleep well and having a good dream. Wake up in the morning having my head feels pain because of overslept, having a back pain just because I slept very roughly. Overjoyed watching Simpson's...HeHe!!!....
<br /><br />Like always, I'm so lazy doing anything and I don't even touch any of my assignment yet. Still waiting for my laptop to be repaired and hopefully I can get it back soon. I miss my laptop so much!!!...
<br />Just few days from the PC fair event and my body is not doing so well. Maybe because of the weather and the rains. I think I'm getting a fever next morning because my body seems so cool and dizzy. Don't want to be sick and lonely. HuHu...sigh!.. Need someone that can cheer me up like before....anyone volunteer?...just kidding, no one really cares about me.....
<br /><br />So, I'll better end up laying down on my bed and stare up my cheek on the shilling above. Maybe a beautiful face will come up on my dream and cheer me up again. Again, I end up wishing something that I can't have....hmmm.....sigh!

Its really crowded and many of the bargain are all eyes catching. There are so many new toys, gadgets, new cool stuff, new tech computer and also the main thing is, more low price which will make you crazy to have all of those gadgets.
<br /><br />My plan to get a new pair of ear plug inMotion Altec Lansing and unfortunately, the model IM716 is not really sold in Malaysia. Maybe they are coming soon, which it will be sell at Malaysia. So sad, I really want it so much. But, my luck on my side, I finally search around the corner and found one cool ear plug brand Somic. Not much on the interface and looks, but the bass boost and also the balance sound synchronize with my Sansa MP3 player, sure will make me to have them. My brother also buy them for his handset Nokia 3250 with Mp3 Express Music.
<br /><br />We also walk around again and again at the PC fair to find other cool stuff. There are so many cool gadgets with low price especially Desktop PC, Laptops, Printers, accessories, DVD/CD and also connection parts like routers and ADSL Dialers. One wireless router catch my eyes that sell only for RM99 and give a good performance. What can you bargain so much more with this price on a ADSL router and not just that, it is a wireless connection plus 4 port LAN. Damn!...I wish I had more budget that day....
<br /><br />After having much fun at PC Fair, both of us so tired and both our legs are cramp from walking. Relax a bitat KL Sentral food court while having some meals. AT 7pm, we head back. So happy that I get my new ear plug and so happy that I do not miss this 2nd PC fair of this year...

For couple of weeks I been busy with my assignments and also some of my projects that meet the dateline. So, I haven't have any time to look for ideas and something to write inside my blog. Most of them dry out on my assignments. 
<br /><br />Finish all my date lines, currently I have some time to write something on my blog. My new assignments is already announce on the net, so I need to get it done by early of September around 10 or 12. So, if I'm busy with my work and no time to write my blog, I again apologize to all my friends. 
<br /><br />My brother is busy with his coming exam on this Friday till Sunday which is gonna be a big issues if I wanna ask him to watch some movies at the TGV. I been miss out lately with all the joy of watching movies. I haven't yet seeing the Rush Hour 3. So shame of me to miss out such cool movie staring by Jackie Chan. I'm a big fan of his movies and actions. Even his Chinese movies like Police Story and also some of his Drunken Master old time actions. I need to see it before I miss something so much fun.
<br /><br />I haven't touch or take a peek on my new assignments which is getting more and more near to its dateline. What the hell happen to me?...Lazy?....Nah!...just bit boring doing something everyday and spend so much time staring at my laptop and my desktop which making my eyes wearing out.  I need a new hobby that doesn't involve computers or techno gadgets. I'm so done with all of them. Ya right!...like hell that will gonna be...HeHeHe!!!.
<br />A student of computer engineering and IT are bored with something about techno, its the worst case scenarios. I not bored about it, just wanna take a time out from it. 
<br /><br />Have any of you hear about the new iMac Desktop PC with have been release by the Apple company for computer user to buy. I have seen it in the websites and also at his Apple Shop at KL lately. I though it was like a mini pc mirror of the Mac Mini. My thought was wrong after all. iMac is one of the newest computer desktop with have decrease it size of his CPU and also combine with a 19' to 22' monitor built in within the CPU. As we can say the monitor and the CPU are in one casing. The only external peripherals was the I/O ports, keyboard and mice. Which like the motto says, It's nothing that thinner than this. Finally, a pc desktop which you can move around without carrying a CPU but just carrying a monitor plus CPU, keyboard and a mice. It's already built in wireless card which you can use outside Wi-Fi. If you haven't seen it, just go to the apple website or the nearest apple computer center. I think there is only a few of them in the KL city which have it on display. 
<br /><br />That all for this week blog post. I try my best to updated as recent as possible and if I have permission from my leader to post my latest assignment review, I will let you know. Hope you guys are ready for the coming final exam which is one month from now. Congratulations for all my friends that having their graduations events and hoping there all are in great shape and happy always. To all Malaysians, Happy 50th Anniversary Kemerdekaan of Malaysia on 31 of August 2007. See you all k!...WhozSha!!!

<br />I wonder of your dream will be fulfilled.

<br />I silently look at your back,
<br />I want to tell you,
<br />Good Luck!...
<br /><br />&quot;Guys, the girl who’s holding onto you is PERFECT in her own special way.

<br /><br />Its quite fascinating with the system interaction within the website which is you can upload any video or music like multiply website (if u have one), but FaceBox is much more  stable and fast to upload any music and video. You doesn't have to gone through any hard ship in html or java script programming or maybe using YouTube to upload any of your video file. In FaceBox also you can share any thing from pictures to video or maybe from anything you like. Simple and easy to use mechanism.
<br /><br />Today, seems for me is quite a very busy day. I got lots of work to be done and in the same time, I got too much of classes to be attend. My Final year project seems going well and my body is creeping me out of it. Not enough rest for this week, and somebody, please help me find a girlfriend. So that, she can give me some company and help me with my work. Please....I'm begging here....
<br /><br />See you guys later, got business to attend.
<br />Take care!

Most of us maybe at home, &quot;guling-guling&quot; around with their siblings and enjoying their free time. Some of us, takes this opportunity having a good time with their own couple, dating. Seems everyone enjoying their time.
<br /><br />Even so, for me, still is the same. Through out this week, busy with studies and work, seems I forgot everything about my worries. Forgot about how miserable I'm, forgot how lonely I'm, forgot about how much wimp is I'm, forgot how much time I wasted just to get a person to like me, and forgot how hell is my life. Seems it's all just a short break amnesia from all the worries that I have. Not to mention, the busiest week of my life is this week. Damn tired!... 
<br /><br />But when it comes to Saturday, all the worries come back and hunted me for two more days and maybe for the rest of my weekend life. Its just like a clock, every time it reach 12, it will goes again and again until its battery weaken to death. Just same as me...
<br /><br />Today, my roommate seems to be nice to me, ask me to join him for lunch and also take me for a shopping at Alamanda. He is sure a very nice guy, and even the person always helps me with my life. Maybe he knows from the look of my face, how miserable I'm, just being nice to cheer me up. Thanks a lot!, my buddy, you are the best roommate ever that I have..
<br /><br />But seems, even he's hard work to cheer me up are not really working, I just show my happy &amp; smiling face so that he may not be worried. Deep inside, still its an empty soul, cracking bit by bit. 
<br /><br />Finish going out until 4pm, back again to my small cage, trap my self at my room, pretending that I nerd, always studying, pretending to be happy, even so its a fake smile, pretend to laugh loud like crazy over anime, still deep inside are shallow with nothing. 
<br /><br />Conclude that, it just my normal ways of spending time over my weekend. It just how a person who am I spending his life during his weekend. And that is how it goes every week, every month, every year and maybe every decade of my future life.
<br /><br />Still is me that you all knows...
