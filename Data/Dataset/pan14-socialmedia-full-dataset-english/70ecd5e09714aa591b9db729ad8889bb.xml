I think it has possibilities So if you are able get a soldier and keep him/or her in your heart - let him/her know you appreciate what he/she does for all of us.Let him/her know by emails ,packages, whatever it takes to support him or her .Give them a reason to come home.And pray for them.Just 3 seconds to God asking to hold them safely in His hands. It isn't alot to ask -just do it . I also encourage you to create a relationship with them offer your support take the time to appreciate what they do for you and yours and me and mine,morale is a big part of it . Aw they're big boys and girls I know but everyone needs to know that they matter.It adds a SPARK to life. So once again take the time to show you care .They are very special people -remember FREEDOM ISN'T FREE. The cost is high -Hold em safely God-Bring em back home -It MATTERS-Peace and Love Dawn

Aw guys I am not trying to make you feel that way . I just want to express how proud I am of what you do and respect the fact that you do it . My daddy did it and know all the things you and your families have to go thru . I know how it feels to try to not associate an airport with sorrow and fear. I know how it feels to wonder what dad is doing on christmas -I know what its like to pray everday that God protects someone I love in a war zone.I also know what it like to see them call you a hero after you are gone.My father left and I have memories, a flag and 21 spent ammo cartridges. He was my hero and I failed to tell him as much as I should have . I loved that soldier with all my heart .He made me so proud to be an American . As do you each and everyone of you so just in case someone forgets to tell you or thinks they have all the time in the world to do it-thank you-you are my heros .I am just me noone special -but because of you I am able to be that girl whoever I wanna be .You gave me that freedom and even now you are there insuring that right remains mine. I have a soft spot for Soldiers -Yeah I do -How could I be truely American and not.God Bless you guys I love You -Rock and Roll -Lock and Load - and thanks from my American Just Me Heart-Dawn

It was awful to hear the hurt and anger thru his words over a keyboard. AW the eagle is shedding a tear here in Kansas. I said a prayer for my friend that God gives him the strength to do what he has to and go on.That he knows we here back at home are thinking of him and his friend and they are both in our prayers.All these guys are .Take a minute respect this man and his friend who gave so much for us .You are thought of you know who you are .God give you peace hun do what you gotta do and know it wasn't all for nothing . I admire the strength you have to be what you are and do what you do. I know there are no words to ease the pain of your situation but know that some of us recognize the sacrifice made by others in the name of freedom and know we do have you in our prayers .Come home safe -Peace Dawn

<br />Have you stopped to thank a veteran today? For the price of freedom they had to pay? Did you gaze into those distant eyes? Did you see the ghosts he can't deny? Did you think a soldier's heart was made of steel? Because he was trained to kill, he couldn't feel? Did you see the guilt written on his face, For the loss of life he can't replace? Did you know he mourns the lives he couldn't save, And walks with comrades in their grave? Did you remember the boy with innocence lost? Do you really know war's ultimate cost? Have you felt the blast of artillery fire? Do you have the courage it would require? Have you stood in trenches consumed with fear? Felt the enemies breath so very near? Have you walked with God on a battleground? Seen your brothers dead or dying all around? Have you stopped to thank a vet today, Or did you just turn and walk away? From the pain he'll carry for the rest of his life, Did you consider his family, his children, his wife? That watch him suffer in silence each and every day, As he's haunted by memories that don't go away? Did you care that the soldier is still pulling guard? That his heart, mind, and soul will forever be scarred? Do you know how he suffers from ptsd? Or that our precious freedom is never free? Do you care that he still hears the blood curdling screams? Or that he returns to the war each night in his dreams? Have you felt the sorrow of a combat vet? Or would you rather just forget? That war has pierced his hardened heart, And torn this soldier all apart? Would you rather our heroes just fade away? Or will you stop to thank a vet today?... 
<br /><br />AS My daddy was a vet -i know how they feel -this was taken from a friend of mine on myspace hope he doesn't mind just wanted to spread the word lol and say thanks to a vet !!! I know what they go thru I loved one -dawn 
<br /><br />Aw hell i love em all they are my family LOL -Peace

<br />sobriety, misery, and confusion. He is sly as a fox, has the nerve
<br />of a dope addict, the stories of an old sailor, the sincerity of a
<br />politician, and the subtlty of Mt. Saint Helen. He is extremely
<br />irresistible, totally irrational and completely indestructible.
<br /><br />A Marine is a Marine all his life. He is a magical creature. You
<br />can kick him out of your house but not out of your heart. You can take him off your mailing list but not off your mind. Marines are found everywhere... in love...in battle... in lust... in trouble...in
<br />debt...in bars and ... behind them. No one can write so seldom and yet think so much of you. No one else can get so much enjoyment out of a letter or clean clothes or a six pack.
<br /><br />A Marine is a genius with a deck of cards. A millionaire without a
<br />cent and brave without a grain of sense. He is the PROTECTOR OF
<br />AMERICA, When he wants something it's usually 30 days leave, music that hurts the ears, a five dollar bill...or a woman he can count on.
<br /><br />Girls love them, mothers tolerate them, fathers brag about them,
<br />the government pays them, the police watch out for them and somehow they all work together.
<br />This is sooo true.......
<br /><br />You can beat their bodies but not their minds. You can tame their hearts but not their souls.
<br /><br />He likes girls, females, women, ladies.
<br /><br />He dislikes small checks, working weekends, answering letters, eating chow, waking up, maintaining a uniform, and the day before payday.
<br /><br />You may as well give in. He is your long distance lover...he is
<br />your steel eyed, warm smiling, blank minded, hyperactive, over reacting, curious, passive, talented spontaneous, physically fit, good for nothing bundle of worry.....
<br /><br />And will always be there for you regardless of how long its been since you've last talked.
<br /><br />If you are a Marine or just support them, Repost this
