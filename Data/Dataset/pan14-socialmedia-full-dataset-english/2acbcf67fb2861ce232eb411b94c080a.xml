<br />First came out my mom's wound. The first thing
<br />I remember was giving the eye to my dad
<br />2 years passed I was home like any other day,
<br />Daddy came home from work, and when he opened 
<br />The door I was running to hug daddy. He lift 
<br />Me up and gave me a kiss on the forhead
<br />Years passed and was the samething I would 
<br />Do &amp; Daddy would do, when I seen him 
<br />Coming from work. Then I turned 
<br />13 and my life and my parents life changed
<br />I wasn't the little gurl dad saw, I wasn't daddy's 
<br />Little gurl or his Princess. All i was to daddy was
<br />A pain. I made my mom suffer alot just the 
<br />Way my brother's did to them, I was following 
<br />My older brother's steps. But from other people's thinking &amp;
<br />Speaking I was the worst child they could ever,
<br />Had. I was alwayz in trouble in skool, home &amp; 
<br />Streets. I was never home, and in skool and to 
<br />Make it worst I would rarely came home to sleep.
<br />The Streets were my life, my house, my family.
<br />I remember the day my mom she'd a tear 
<br />For me when she saw my hands bloody
<br />She thought the worst things about me and 
<br />I don't blame her. But from all that she hugged
<br />Me and kissed me in the cheek and she told me
<br />&quot;Mija, estas bien&quot; All I remember saying was:
<br />&quot;Fuck!!!, Mom, Do you see me falling or what?
<br />Move out of my way!!&quot; I looked back and 
<br />Saw her crying in my dad's shoulder 
<br />I didn't care seeing her cry like that
<br />The years passed I had gotten worst my 
<br />Parents couldn't control me. Until one day
<br />I was sitting in the corner of my bed and 
<br />Thinking to myself in how I
<br />Made my two people i loved and that matter in my life
<br />Suffer alot twice as all my brothers ever did. But I 
<br />Thought I was to late to change in everything and 
<br />Recover all the faults I ever did to them
<br />But I was wrong, Now that I'm a Lady I know
<br />That is never late to change when you 
<br />Love the people you made suffer. But all the things
<br />I went trough my parents never left 
<br />Me, by myself. But were there for me in the
<br />Good and bad times and that they still are
<br />But now I got a little brother to take care 
<br />Of and not commit the same faults I did
<br />I know my parents are getting old, 
<br />I'm still Daddy's little gurl and his little princess in his eyes
<br />But the thing i would never forget is 
<br />That they still loved me when I was bad and that 
<br />They love me till' this day. &quot;Dad, Mom 
<br />Los quiero mucho, y perdonenme por todas 
<br />Cosas que les he hecho en la vida, yo no se
<br />Como les voy a pagar todo lo que hicieron por mi
<br />I love you Jefe y Jefa.

BUT I WAS WRONG. WE BOTH GOT HURT SO BADLY I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOVE YOU ALL MY LIFE, THAT YOU WERE THE ONE I WAS GOING TO MARRY. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE YOUR BABIES MOMMA. BUT ALL THOSE LIES WE SAID TO EACH OTHER REALLY HURT US.  WHO EVER THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA END UP LIKE THIS. WE ONLY FOOLED OURSELFS AND THE PEOPLE WE LOVED. WE MADE THINK THAT WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. I CANT BELIEVE IT!! THAT WE ENDED UP GETTING ENGAGE WHAT FOR???? WE BOTH KNEW THIS WAS ONLY A GAME, AT LEAST I THOUGHT IT WAS. I SWORE ON MYSELF NOT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU, BUT MY HEART WAS STRONGER THAN MY MIND. I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU, THAT WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER DID IN MY LIFE.I TRY NOT TO SHOW YOU. BUT I COULDN'T ALL THOSE &quot;I LOVE YOU'S&quot; DIDNT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU, ALL THOSE NIGHTS YOU NEVER CALLED ME STARTED TO GET AT ME, AND IT WAS HURTING ME. I TRIED NOT TO CRY, BUT I COULDNT HELP IT I WOULD TELL MYSELF &quot;DONT CRY, DONT CRY HE'S JUST A GAME&quot; BUT MY HEART WILL ALWAYZ TAKE OVER. I WOULD CRY, MY MIND STARTED GOING KRAZY. IT WAS DAYZ THAT I DIDNT SEE YOU. BUT I DIDNT MIND EVENTHOUGH INSIDE OF ME WAS KILLING ME. YOU WOULD ALWAYZ MAKE ME LAUGH WITH YOUR JOKES. BUT AFTER THAT ALL YOU BROUGHT ME WAS TEARS IN MY EYES. BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING FROM YOU IS TO NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH A &quot;PLAYER&quot; AND &quot;NEVER GET ATTATCH WITH SOMEONE WHO DONT DESERVE YOU&quot; I JUST HOPE THAT AFTER I LET U GO YOU FOUND SOMEONE THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE AND NOT PLAY AROUND WITH HER HEART LIKE YOU DID TO MINE. JUST REMEMBER &quot;WHAT COMES AROUND, GOES AROUND&quot; HOPES THAT YOUR HAPPY NOW THAT YOU FOUND YOUR NEW LOVE AND I WISH YOU BOTH THE BEST, HAPPINESS, AND GOODNESS IN YOUR LIFES. BUT KNOW THAT I'LL ALWAYZ LOVE YOU, EVEN IF WE WEREN'T MEAN FOR EACH OTHER.

IM TIRED OF ALL THE PEOPLE TELLING ME WHAT AND NOT WHAT TO DO ALL I WANT IS TO LIVE MY OWN LIFE YOU PEOPLE SHOULDN’T CARE ABOUT THE LIFE IM LIVING, WORRY ABOUT YOURS. I PICKED THE GANGSTER LIFE IM STICKING TO IT TILL THE DAY I DIE. BUT ILL ALWAYZ STAND UP WITH MY HEAD HELD UP HIGH. MY MIND IS GOING KRAZY I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD. I HEAR MY PARENTS TELLING ME THAT THEY LOVE ME. I SEE MY CARNALITO GIVING ME A HUG. I SEE MY CARNALA LAUGHING AT THE SHTI WE USE TO DO. THEN AFTER ALL THOSE FLASHBACKS I SEE MYSELF IN THE MIRROR WITH A GUN TO MY HEAD. AND I SEE TEARS IN MY EYEZ I SAY TO MYSELF “THIS IS IT”. 1 BULLET OUT OF THIS GUN AND EVERYTHING IS GONE. THAT’S IT. THE GURL THAT ONCE EXISTED IN THIS FUCKED UP WORLD IS GONE AT A SNAP OF A FINGER. “HAHAHA” YEAH I TAKE MY LAST LAUGH. BECAUSE EVENTHOUGH I WAS IN THIS BITCH WORLD NOBODY SAW ME FALL LIKE THIS. NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY HIT ME AND NOWW IM MAKING MYSELF FALL LIKE THIS??? FUCK I CANT BELIEVE IT. AFTER ALL THE SHIT IVE BEEN THROUGH IM THE ONE ENDING MY LIFE. I ASK MYSELF. WHY NOW??? WHY KILL MYSELF NOW??? HOW COME I DIDN’T DO IT WHEN I WAS GOING TO MY ROUGH TIMES??? BUT I DON’T GET ANSWERZ “GOD PLEASE ANSWER ME!!!! SHOULD I STAY??? OR SHOULD I PULL THIS TRIGGER”?? MY HANDS ARE SWEATING TEARS STILL KEEP FALLING OFF MY EYEZ. WHEN IM ABOUT PULL THE TRIGGER. I HEAR A KNOCK … I DON’T PAY ATTENTION. I HEAR IT AGAIN. AND I HEAR A VOICE FROM THE DOOR “SISTER DON’T DO IT, PLEASE I LOVE YOU” YEAH THAT VOICE I HEAR IS MY CARNALITOS VOICE THAT KEEPS ME ALIVE EVERYDAY HE MAKES ME SNAPP BACK TO REALITY. I DROPPED THE GUN. WHEN THE GUN HIT’S THE FLOOR I SEE THE DOOR OPEN AND THE SUN SHOOTS THE BULLET. WHEN I TURN AROUND I FEEL IT GO THROUGH MY HEAD. I SEE MYSELF FALL BACK AND LAND ON MY CARNALITOS ARMS ALL I SAY BEFORE MY LAST BREATH WAS “IM SORRY AND I LUV YOU CARNAL” HE HOLDS MY HAND. IT FALLS TO THE GROUND. FUCK!!! I SEE MYSELF LAYING THERE WITH A BULLET IN MY HEAD. I SEE MY CARNAL CRYING AND SCREAMING AS I SEE THE COPZ PULLING HIM AWAY FROM MY BODY. I HEAR HIM SCREAMING “NO” THE COPS PULL A BLANKET OVER MY HEAD. BUT FOR SOME REASON I SCREAM “NO!!!! IM STILL ALIVE CANT YOU SEE. I STILL WANNA LIVE. I KNOW I CAN CHANGE I KNOW I CAN. GOD HEAR ME OUT, IM ON MY KNEES GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK PLEASE GOD!!!!” AS I FADE AWAY FROM THIS WORLD. I WAKE UP SWEATING AND CRYING AND SAYING “OHH SHIT!!! IT WAS A DREAM”
<br /><br />SO TO ALL PEOPLE OUT THERE THINKING OF KILLING THEMSELVES THINK ABOUT IT TWICE. BECAUSE YOU DONG KNOW HOW MUCH YOU FAMILY IS GOING TO BE SUFFERING YOU THINK LEAVING THIS WORLD EVERYTHING WILL FADE AWAY. YEAH MAYBE TO YOU BUT TO YOUR FAMILY , IT WOULD LEAVE THEM A BURDEN AND A BROKEN HEART. SO KEEP YOUR HEAD UP HELD HIGH!!! AND DON’T MAKE YOURSELF FALL DOWN LIKE THIS … KEEP WALKING YOULL FIND YOUR SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEMZ.

<br /><br />Heavenly Father, please hear me tonight
<br />I need so much guidance to live
<br />My life right. Sometimes the pressure
<br />Is so hard to bear. I often wonder if
<br />Anyone cares. How can I wake up and
<br />Face a new day, knowing I must live
<br />My life this krazy way? Heavenly Father, 
<br />Forgive all my sins.
<br /><br />Give me strenght to resist then
<br />Wild life I desire, help me escape temptation
<br />And the fire. Please help my family
<br />Whose eyes silently plead for me not to
<br />Do wrong and they pray for me. God
<br />Bless our mothers who cry every night
<br />Worrying, we'll be killed by someone in a 
<br />Fight.
<br /><br />Heavenly Father, please answer my prayers
<br />Please let me know that you're listening
<br />Up there. When will it end? What's 
<br />It all for? To prove to my homies I'm
<br />Down; I'm hardcore? Sometimes I wonder
<br />How I will die ... ... By a bullet wound
<br />Or a knife in my side? Heavenly Father,
<br />Please hear me tonight.
<br /><br />Show me the way, Lord; Show me the light
<br />Give my heart peace, So I won't have 
<br />To fight. Thank you for your forgiveness,
<br />And for still being there. Most of all, thank
<br />You for hearing my prayer. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
