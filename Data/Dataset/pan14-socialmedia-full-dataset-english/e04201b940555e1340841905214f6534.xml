Templates can save you big money and time. It is common knowledge that “design houses” like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids </a>charge a minimum of 1k for a complete website filled with images and text. Again, this is the minimum geeks on steroids would charge and I would estimate that the average price of a website you will pay is approximately 2-3k. Why are you paying this much for a website?  Most of it is because you can’t build one yourself so the cost skyrockets for convenience.  Is there anything you can do to reduce this skyrocket effect? Yes you can! Website templates often get connected to cheap or bad design, but the point is somewhat valid since there are tons of low quality templates and what’s worse is that it’s being sold on many template websites.<br /><br />Don’t Give Away Your Bank Account<br /><br />How many times have you seen the same templates on different websites? Probably a lot so the solution is to find QUALITY templates from a company that keeps their products in-house, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids. </a> can build your own and unique website. There is such a thing as affordable quality website templates, really there is. We define quality as a template with excellent interface design, navigation, color theory, and overall impact power.<br /><br />The Power of Flash<br /><br />A powerful website template should make a powerful positive statement.  Flash really makes an amazing impact in this process because it can encompass sound and animations. Flash can give you the wow factor that static html can supply. Corporate websites such as Adidas and Mercedes uses a fair amount of flash to deliver the message across. These guys know the power of Flash, so we should probably take a look into the reasoning of this, flash has positive things and negative ones, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids </a> works with it only when the customer uses it as a requirement.<br /><br />High Impact Design<br /><br />So the question, where can you find affordable website templates? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids</a> is the ticket if you’re looking for something that can create a high-impact impression and not break your bank account. Website templates also have the ability to be modified to your liking, so after you change out the graphics, color scheme or move around the navigation you essentially have your own creation.<br /><br />Custom Design Vs Templates<br /><br />There is absolutely room for both in this vast universe we call the web, and both options have its strengths and weakness. The bottom line is cost. Do you have a few grand to spend on a website? If you don’t, a quality template will probably be your best bet.  For approximately $100, you can purchase a very nice template and spend the rest on marketing and promotion.  With the vast amount of money you will be saving, you can hire somebody to modify your template the way you want it for perhaps $300. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids</a> don’t believe in cheap recycled templates, but geeks on steroids do recommends looking into high quality templates that can present you the way you should be presented. You truly have one shot to make a great impression,  don’t  ruin it with a cheap overproduced template.<br /><br />The Choice Is Yours, Be Wise about It<br /><br />The real reason for this article is a recent beef with several “design houses” over charging the average person looking for a nice website. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids</a> know people have to make money running a business, but there is something wrong about producing a bill that is thousands over what a website is worth. There will be talk about what a website is truly worth but I have been in the design business for several years and have worked in a corporate environment. I have personally seen where we would charge 10 times what a website is truly cost as far as manpower hours, and it made me sick to see that.<br /><br />So <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank">geeks on steroids</a> was invented to bridge that gap between quality and cost. geeks on steroidsThink that they´re not only bridged that gap, we overlapped and paved a new road for better internet.

It is common knowledge that â??design housesâ?? like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> charge at the least 1k for a complete website packed with images and text. Again, this is a minimum geeks on steroids would charge and I might estimate that the average price of an website you will pay is around 2-3k. Why are you paying close to this much for a website? Most of it is because you canâ??t build one yourself so the cost skyrockets for convenience. Is there anything that you can do to reduce this skyrocket effect? Yes it is possible to! Website templates often get connected to cheap or bad design, but and ofcourse somewhat valid since there are a lot of low quality templates and whatâ??s worse is that itâ??s being sold on many template websites.<br /><br />Donâ??t Give Away Your money<br /><br />How many times have you seen the identical templates on different websites? Probably considerably so the solution is to find QUALITY templates from your company that keeps their products in-house, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids. </a> can build your and unique website. There is a really thing as affordable quality website desing templates, really there is. We define quality for a template with excellent interface design, selection, color theory, and overall impact power.<br /><br />The Power of Flash<br /><br />A powerful website template should generate a powerful positive statement. Flash really makes an exceptional impact in this process because it could actually encompass sound and animations. Flash can supply you with the wow factor that static html might supply. Corporate websites such as Adidas and Mercedes relies on a fair amount of flash to deliver the message across. These guys know the strength of Flash, so we should probably take a look into the reasoning of this, thumb has positive things and negative versions, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> works with it as long as the customer uses it as a requirement.<br /><br />High Impact Design<br /><br />So this question, where can you find affordable web page templates? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> is the ticket if youâ??re in need of something that can create a high-impact impression and not break your money. Website templates also have the capacity be modified to your liking, so as soon as you change out the graphics, color scheme or move around the navigation you essentially have ones own creation.<br /><br />Custom Design Vs Templates<br /><br />There's absolutely room for both in this vast universe we call the online market place, and both options have its strengths and weakness. The bottom line is actually cost. Do you have a few grand to spend on a website? If you donâ??t, a quality template is going to be your best bet. For approximately $100, you can purchase a very nice template and spend the others on marketing and promotion. With the vast amount of money you will be saving, you can hire somebody to modify your template profession want it for perhaps $300. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> donâ??t rely on cheap recycled templates, but geeks on steroids do recommends looking into top quality templates that can present you how you should be presented. You truly have one shot to generate a great impression, donâ??t ruin it with a cheap overproduced template.<br /><br />The Choice Is actually Yours, Be Wise about It<br /><br />The real reason for this article can be a recent beef with several â??design housesâ?? over charging the average person looking for a nice website. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> know people have to make money running a business, but there is something wrong about producing a bill that is thousands over such a website is worth. There will be talk about such a website is truly worth but I have been in the design business for several years and have worked in a corporate environment. I have personally seen where we'd charge 10 times what a website is truly cost as much as manpower hours, and it made me sick to see that.<br /><br />So <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vZ2Vla3NvbnN0ZXJvaWRz" target="_blank"> geeks on steroids </a> was invented to bridge that gap involving quality and cost. geeks on steroidsThink that theyÂ´re but not only bridged that gap, we overlapped and paved a new road for better internet.
