<br />The teenager pulled together in grey short bcbg dresses..
<br />Guided by an unknown female companion pointing out the sites, the pair seemed to be enjoying their tour of the Tuscan city. 
<br /> A guided tour: The mother and daughter were joined by an unknown female companion who appeared to be showing them the sights
<br />   They were seen last week soaking in the sights of Croatia. 
<br />And now Teri Hatcher and her statuesque daughter Emerson have continued their European getaway - with a jaunt to Florence, Italy over the weekend.
<br />The actress and her stunning 14-year-old were seen taking to the streets near the famous Ponte Vecchio bridge over the Arno River, snapping photos of the picturesque scene.
<br /> Blending into the crowd: Teri Hatcher strolls through Florence, Italy on Sunday with her daughter Emerson
<br />The Desperate Housewives star, 47, was dressed down for the casual Sunday outing, wearing a white linen halter bcbg dress(Read more:<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bcbgdressescanada.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.bcbgdressescanada.com</a>) with floral detail and slip-on sandals.
<br />Emerson, clearly taking after her mother, was a natural young beauty, her honey blonde locks whipping back with a gust of wind as they walked over a bridge.
<br /><br />So much to see! Teri, 47, and Emerson, 14, strolled near the famous Ponte Vecchio bridge over the Arno River
<br /> Like mother, like daughter: Next to each other, Emerson clearly takes after the actress
<br /> Making memories: Teri goes behind the lens for once and takes some images of the scenic view 
<br />Mother and daughter were seen just last Wednesday lapping up the sun and letting their hair down for a rafting excursion in Omis, Croatia.
<br />Emerson looked like she was enjoying her summer off, wearing a pink fringed bikini for the trip, although the pair eventually put on wet suits, life jackets and helmets for their trip down the Cetina River.
<br />Bobbing in the water, Teri's face seemed to express shock at the cold temperature before they were escorted into their rafts and paddled off.
<br /> Her girl: The actress snapped a picture of Emerson posing over the bridge 
<br /> Strolling along: The pair passed by dozens of handbags for sale walking through the narrow streets
<br />   Breathtaking: Teri seems enamoured by the view as Emerson flashes a smile on the latest leg of their trip
<br />The actress appeared in four episodes of the ABC Family series Jane by Design after wrapping Housewives; and shortly before jetting off with Emerson, Teri was in Mexico City to film new movie, I Brake for Gringos. 
<br />The coming-of-age comedy centers around two young high school students caught up in crazy adventures when they travel to Puerto Vallarta for the most memorable spring break of their lives.
<br /><br />Working up an appetite: Teri and Emerson stopped into a local cafe for a snack
<br /> What's up there? Teri takes another picture of a captivating sight - but her daughter's body language seems to indicate she's disinterested
<br />While they threw themselves into activity for the day, Teri and Emerson have spent most of their vacation relaxing as they enjoy time away from the States.
<br />The holiday is undoubtedly a welcome departure from the actress' busy work schedule. 
<br />Teri recently concluded her role as Susan Mayer, a sexy stay-at-home mother, on TV hit Desperate Housewives; but she has been steadily working since the series finale in May.

<br />  She's gone from London-based soap opera EastEnders to the leading role in a Hollywood TV show Bionic Woman.
<br />As Michelle Ryan marked her latest foray in movies in the newest 'Brit flick' The Man Inside, the actress made a nod to old Hollywood with a bcbg dress.
<br />The North Londoner, 28, went for retro glamour in a white bcbg dress and beehive as she joined her co-stars at the London premiere of the boxing drama.
<br />Scroll down to watch a trailer
<br /><br />Old school Hollywood: Actress Michelle Ryan looks summery in a white bcbg dress(About the dress,you can get more information from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bcbgdressescanada.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcbgdressescanada.com</a> at the London premiere of The Man Inside
<br />Joining her at the Vue Leicester Square were co-stars Ashley Thomas, Peter Mullan, Theo Barklem-Biggs and Ray Panthaki - who also starred in EastEnders.
<br />Also on the red carpet was current EastEnders stars and real-life couple Jacqueline Jossa and Tony Discipline.
<br />The Man Inside stars Thomas as a boxer, Clayton Murdoch, trying to distance himself from his gangster father (David Harwood).
<br /><br />Celebrate: Michelle joins her co-stars Ashley Thomas and Peter Mullan on the red carpet
<br />Michelle plays recovering drug addict Alexia, who grows close to the young boxer as he is being trained by her father Gordon Sinclair (Mullan).
<br />Meanwhile, the actress recently laughed off speculation she would return to EastEnders.
<br />Her character Zoe's on-screen mother Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) returned to Walford in 2010 after a five-year absence.
<br />But Michelle is adamant she won't be reprising her role again after she left the soap in 2005.
<br /> Soap love birds: Current EastEnders stars and real-life couple Jacqueline Jossa and Tony Discipline
<br />She said: 'It's like I wouldn't go back to school. I just believe that sometimes in life you're like a shark - you have to keep moving through water otherwise you'll die.
<br />'For me, once I've worked on something and it's finished, it's like an ex-boyfriend: you don't go back to them. I've done it with my heart and soul, so I wouldn't go back because it's not part of my make-up to do so. I think it's important to do different things.'
<br />Instead, Michelle is focused on training for the West End production of Cabaret, which sees her play Liza Minnelli's character Sally Bowles.

<br />The 39-year-old actress Kate Beckinsale was spotted out in Los Angeles wearing a Bcbg Yellow Olesya Draped Evening Gown Dress(For more information about the bcbg gown from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bcbgdressescanada.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcbgdressescanada.com</a>) earlier today and this mom — can pull.it.off!
<br />She looks absolutely flawless from her hair down to her amazing shoes (swoon) and everything about this white bcbg  dress I just adore.
<br />If she ever comes out with an exercise routine or a hair care product line, you can count me in at the first of the line because I am dying to know this woman’s secrets!
<br />  Pop singer Katy Perry is usually all about brightly colored hairstyles, fun girly outfits, and an all-around bold style, but she traded that persona in for a more dressed-down, casual look. Perry went to a &quot;The xx&quot; concert Monday night, July 23, 2012, wearing a beautiful long, sheer, white bcbg dress with a large floral pattern all over it. The outfit was definitely indie-inspired since she wore comfortable black ankle boots, a low-slung belt, and a large black sun hat to complete the look. For jewelry, she wore layered necklaces and a large silver bangle to give her bcbg red dress some edge.
<br /><br />Although she was seen with long purple locks a few weeks back, the singer traded that hairstyle for a simple, short black bob that reached her neck. Her makeup for the event was also subdued, with sheer beige eyeshadow dusted on her eyelids and a matte foundation that kept her face from looking shiny. On her lips was a somewhat natural shade of rose-red that was reminiscent of the 1920s that matched the red floral pattern. While at the concert, Katy Perry took to Twitter and tweeted the phrase, &quot;I always love seeing one single piece of confetti fall at an indie show.&quot;

<br />One of the girls! Una Healy's baby daughter Aoife Belle has become the sixth member of their band as they continue their trip to Los Angeles
<br />Earlier today (Wednesday) the pretty youngster was brought along to join the girls as they dined at a restaurant in Robertson Boulevard as they continue filming their new reality show.
<br />And Aoife was flavour of the day as all of the girls couldn't wait for it to be their turn to dote on her.
<br />As the five-piece sat around the wooden table in the eatery Aoife was first handed to newly married singer Rochelle Wiseman.
<br /><br />Here come the girls! The Saturdays are in America filming their new reality show and this time have had an extra member join them for the excursion as Una continues getting used to motherhood
<br />Centre of attention: The tot was doted on by all of the singers as they filmed scenes in a diner on Robertson Boulevard
<br />  Frankie also showed off her figure in a black frock with a thin tan belt and matching wedges and Vanessa also went for a black ensemble.
<br />Holding on tight: Even Aoife looked stylish in her blue and green frock as Healy protectively carried her along
<br />Time for a rest: After being carried around all day Aoife Belle was put down in her pram as the girls went on their way
<br />Hanging around: The girls chatted amongst themselves until they decided what next to do with their day
<br />Una kept hers simple with shorts and a printed vest top.
<br />And Aoife even managed to fit in with the girls yet again with her stylish blue and green get-up.
<br />The group only touched down in Los Angeles last week to invade the US with their pop offerings and film their brand new reality TV show.
<br /><br />Dressed to impress: The girls made an impact as they strutted through the sunny city
<br />Showing Aoife their style: If the girls' fashion is anything to go by Una's baby will grow up to be one stylish girl
<br />Mollie's coming to get you! Blonde beauty King was also smitten as she doted on Aoife across the table
<br />They've made an extra special effort this trip to ensure they look their best seem as they're constantly being caught on camera.
<br />Mollie stepped out in a white shirt done up to her neck with a mini-skirt to show off her enviable legs, while Rochelle opted for an olive green bodycon <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.designerdressesmall.com%2Fwhite-la-femme-16933-single-shoulder-short-party-dress-sale-p-135.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerdressesmall.com/white-la-femme-16933-single-shoulder-short-party-dress-sale-p-135.html</a>  with collar detailing.
<br /><br />They've all been on overseas trips before filming various music videos and shoots.
<br />But The Saturdays' latest trip to Los Angeles was always going to be a different one, thanks to the addition of a new extra special girl - bandmate Una Healy's baby daughter Aoife Belle.
<br />Although it seems like the adorable tot is fitting right in as a sixth member of the girl group during the trip.
<br /><br />Stepping up their style: The girls, including Frankie Sandford and Una Healy, have upped their fashion stakes as they set about making an impact Stateside
<br />She looked delighted as the youngster sat on her lap while mum Una held her hands and pulled faces at her.
<br />Wiseman grinned widely as she bounced her up and down, all in full view of the cameramen filming their every move for the new U.S. show.
<br />Ensuring she wasn't left out, next it was Frankie Sandford's turn to take care of pretty Aoife as Una took a break from mummy duties.
<br /><br />My turn! Frankie Sandford also ensured she got to spend time with Aoife as she sat on her lap while Vanessa White entertained her
<br />Enjoying her trip: Aoife Belle is carried by mum Una in the sunshine in between breaks from filming
<br />Frankie sat with her on her lap at the table while Vanessa White took it upon herself to entertain the baby while Mollie King looked lovingly on.
<br />The singers were later seen walking along the street in the sunshine.
<br />And again Aoife Belle became one of the girls as Healy carried her while stepping in unison with her friends.

<br />Tenderly placing her hand on her tummy, the platinum blonde was the picture of glowing pregnancy health.
<br />Surrounded by multiple pastel-coloured animal accessories, Holly also posed for the camera with one of her own pet pooches. 
<br /><br />Dream in cream: The former Girls Of The Playboy Mansion star displayed her growing baby bump off in a La Femme 16503 White Tuck-Sculpted Homecoming Dresses from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fcheap-la-femme-16503-white-tucksculpted-homecoming-dresses-p-109.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/cheap-la-femme-16503-white-tucksculpted-homecoming-dresses-p-109.html</a>  for the occasion

<br />On the website for the new line, Holly describes her new products.
<br />'Lucky Pet Products was inspired by my work with shelter &amp; rescue animals, animals who were “lucky” enough to have landed in a place where they were safe from harm while waiting for new homes,' she writes.
<br />Meanwhile, it was announced today that Holly will part ways with her topless Las Vegas burlesque show, Peepshow, on October 21 in preparation for her new arrival.
<br />The announcement comes as Holly had previously said she would be finishing with the show in December.
<br /><br />She is pregnant with her first child, but Holly Madison is showing no signs of slowing down.

<br />'We will be announcing our casting change quite soon.'
<br />Zieger said that Holly's Little Bo Peep role will be replaced by 'other personalities and celebrities', but has already ruled out Carmen Electra and Jenny McCarthy, who were both rumoured to be stepping into Holly's shoes, as replacements.
<br />'This will all happen very fast,' Zeiger said of the upcoming auditions. 'We’re having auditions and meetings, even today.'

<br />She told Us Weekly magazine: 'I've been lucky. No morning sickness but I do get a little nauseous.
<br />'I told Pasquale no food craving runs in the middle of the night. No chocolate cake! I don't want to let myself go then have a tough time getting back in shape.
<br />'I try to eat healthy for the baby, I love vegetables and fruit smoothies but my downfall is French fries. My excuse is they settle my stomach.'

<br />Holly and her party promoter boyfriend Pasquale Rotella will welcome their first child into the world early next year.

<br />She said: 'I texted him from the doctor's office, I knew he'd be so happy. We want six kids.'
<br />But in worrying news for the couple, Rotella is facing up to 13 years in prison on charges of bribery and embezzlement.

<br />Next she started dating Nick Farmer, 29, and the happy couple moved in together, booked their wedding and reception and even sent out all the invitations.

<br />France is set to ban the words 'mother' and 'father' from all official documents under controversial plans to legalise gay marriage
<br />I apologise for my gay marriage 'bigot' slur, says Clegg as he tries to limit fallout caused by remark
<br />But her world was turned upside down when her chief bridesmaid Sarah Woodford, 33, plucked up the courage to confess her love for her - just six weeks before the big day.
<br />Incredibly, Kerry suddenly realised why she had never been able to settle down with Mr Right - because she had been looking for Mrs Right.
<br />Kerry ditched Nick, but delayed explaining the real reason - afraid of hurting his feelings.
<br />Instead she moved in with her secret admirer and six months later brave Sarah proposed to Kerry, who said yes.
<br />Relieved friends have now finally seen Kerry make it down the aisle at the couple’s no-expense-spared bash - held at the same venue where she had planned to marry a man.
<br />The happy bride said that finally getting married had been the happiest day of her life.
<br /><br />A runaway bride who jilted three men has finally tied the knot - with her maid of homour.
<br />Kerry De’ath, 29, first ran out on her fiance Craig Smith, 32, just months before they were set to jet to Florida for the dream wedding they spent years saving for.
<br />The bolting bride then settled down with a second love, Dave Futter, 29, for two and a half years - but left him when he popped the question.
<br /><br />Here comes the bride: Kerry who liked the La Femme 17263 Lavender Strapless Sequin Short Homecoming Dress 2012 from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fla-femme-17263-lavender-strapless-sequin-short-homecoming-dress-2012-p-13.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/la-femme-17263-lavender-strapless-sequin-short-homecoming-dress-2012-p-13.html</a> finally makes it down the aisle at the couple's no-expense-spared bash - held at the same venue where she had planned to marry a man
<br />After a heart to heart chat with Sarah, Kerry suddenly realised why she had never been able to settle down with Mr Right - because she had been looking for Mrs Right
<br />She said: 'I know it sounds like something out of a film, but you can’t help who you fall in love with.
<br />'I always thought I was meant to be with a man. I suppose I just wanted to be ‘normal’.
<br />'I settled down with men but every time they started talking about marriage something just didn’t feel right and I panicked.
<br />'I think the thought of marriage made me question whether I truly wanted to be with them for the rest of my life. And every time it was ‘no’, but I never knew why.
<br />'When I was making arrangements to marry Nick, Sarah sat me down on her bed and said ‘I love you’.
<br />'I couldn’t believe it. Then she said ‘don’t marry him’.
<br />'I had no idea how she felt. But as she said the words I started it started to feel right.
<br />'I’d spent all that time worrying about marrying a man - when it was a woman I was looking for.
<br />'Nick was pretty shocked when he found out, but he is alright about it now.
<br />'My family have been great and really supportive, which was a relief because they are quite old fashioned so I was really worried.
<br />'Despite everything, everyone just wanted to see me finally married.
<br /><br />Worth the wait: Sarah, right, had secretly been in love with Kerry for two years before finding the courage to tell her
<br />'My brother even threatened to drag me down the aisle if I didn’t show up.
<br />'Luckily I did and now I’m finally married and it’s amazing.'
<br />Kerry from from Southend, Essex, grew up always believing she would settle down with a man and have a family.
<br />After she met her first would-be husband, cable installer Craig Smith, the couple settled down together for 11 years and had children Ellie, 10, and George, four.
<br />But only months before they were due to get on a plane and fly to Florida, USA, to marry at Cypres Gardens theme park, Kerry backed out.
<br />She moved out and became romantically involved with school pal Dave Futter, a shop assistant, who she believed was ‘the one’.
<br />But after two-and-a-half-years together Dave started talking about marriage and Kerry dumped him.
<br /><br />Kerry who thinks the La Femme 17263 Navy Sequin Strapless Homecoming Dress 2012 from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fla-femme-17263-navy-sequin-strapless-homecoming-dress-2012-p-14.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/la-femme-17263-navy-sequin-strapless-homecoming-dress-2012-p-14.html</a> are not bad says the pair clicked and instantly knew they wanted to be together for the rest of their lives - a feeling of certainty she had never had with a man
<br />Still believing she was meant for a man, Kerry fell for Nick Farmer, a musician, who she agreed to marry after they had been together for two years.
<br />The pair had set a date to marry at Langtons House registry office, in Hornchurch, Essex, and more than 100 invitations.
<br />But six weeks before the wedding day Sarah asked Kerry to have an important talk with her.
<br />Her maid of honour then dropped the bombshell she was smitten with her and begged her not to marry Nick.
<br />Kerry says the pair clicked and instantly knew they wanted to be together for the rest of their lives - a feeling of certainty she had never had with a man.
<br />After three failed attempts the runaway bride finally married on September 15 at Langtons House registry office in Hornchurch, Essex, watched by 140 guests.

<br />Sarah, who was secretly in love with Kerry for two years before finding the courage to tell her, said: 'I never thought I would get the reaction I did. But now I am so glad I stopped the wedding.'

<br />That's how to make an entrance! Bra-less Kim Kardashian struts to her Miami hotel in a Bcbg Mariana Tiered A-Line Cocktail Dress from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fdiscount-bcbg-mariana-tiered-aline-cocktail-dress-p-162.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/discount-bcbg-mariana-tiered-aline-cocktail-dress-p-162.html</a> 
<br />Kanye West sets Twitter tongues wagging as he mysteriously abandons his page... but says he will 'be back soon'
<br />The clip goes alongside a feature spread she has inside the British publication, showing her getting ready for a photoshoot.
<br />The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star answered some other quirky questions such as what her last meal would be if she was on Death Row.
<br /><br />Read the full interview in the November issue of Tatler magazine, out now
<br />After having a number of high-profile relationships in recent years with the likes of Reggie Bush, Miles Austin and her basketball player ex-husband Kris Humphries , Kim admitted she is a 'hopeless romantic' and believes every boyfriend she's ever had has been 'the one'.
<br /><br />She explained: 'When I look back at interviews I gave [about previous boyfriends] saying, “We’re talking about marriage, etc.” It’s embarrassing. And I really believed it at the time! 
<br />'I’m such a hopeless romantic that I’ll always believe the next one is the one.'
<br />Posing in what appeared to be a white wedding dress with ruffle detail, the brunette beauty also hit back at claims her brief 72-day marriage to second husband Kris Humphries was a publicity stunt for Keeping Up with the Kardashians, explaining the failure of the short union was 'embarrassing'.
<br />'I mean, that is just not the person I am. Who would honestly get married for ratings? It’s not like the ratings had dropped and we needed a boost,' Kim added in the Tatler interview. 
<br /><br />No chance: In the behind-the-scenes clip she revealed she is disgusted by bad hygiene and big ears
<br />Despite the wealthy star probably having sampled some of the finest food in the world, she said: ‘Cheese pizza, Oreo cookie ice-cream and maybe a vanilla cup cake.’
<br />On Sunday she demonstrated another example of herself being rather low-key. She tweeted a picture of herself still wearing pyjamas despite it nearing the afternoon.
<br />Perhaps she had spent the morning reliving her youth with some children’s television.

<br /><br />Poking fun: Kim showed off her tongue on Twitter as she entered the bathroom
<br /><br />Kim shared in her Tatler video that her favourite cartoon growing up was Rainbow Brite.
<br />In the main piece, Kardashian has opened up about her romance with Kanye West, admitting she can't imagine being with anyone apart from the rapper for the rest of her life. 
<br /><br />Posing in a white bridal-style gown in a stunning new shoot, the socialite explained her beau is her 'best friend' and their relationship is entirely different from anything she has ever been through before.
<br /><br />Looking forward: Kim Kardashian opened up about her relationship with Kanye West in a revealing new shoot, admitting she 'can't imagine being with anyone else'
<br />'Embarrassing': Kim admitted she cringes when she looks back on interviews she gave with ex-boyfriends, claiming they were 'the one'
<br />She said: 'It’s so nice to have a best friend in this game who understands everything you’re going through. Being with someone I’ve known for so many years is comforting. 
<br />'He’s been there through so many different stages of my life and before I was famous, so this relationship is a different thing entirely. It’s good to be aware that he definitely doesn’t want anything from me too, because he understands the business. 
<br />'I can’t even think about being with anyone else than the man I’m with.’
<br />'Best friend': Kim, pictured with boyfriend Kanye West, explained if she gets married for a third time it will be a quiet affair in front of just her friends and family on a secluded island
<br /><br />She has dated many men in the entertainment industry and has endured two marriages that didn’t work out.
<br />And now fans could be one step closer to finding out what it is that is a deal breaker for Kim Kardashian as far as her romances go.
<br />The 31-year-old spoke about her biggest turn offs in a behind-the-scenes video for Tatler magazine.
<br />She is rather particular when it comes to her men, making sure the guy she is dating it is always impeccably fresh. She also admitted that size does matter.

<br />As she left the West London restaurant with friends, the Coco Mademoiselle ambassador was seen looked a little worse for wear, no doubt looking forward to getting home after what was a very cold and wet night.
<br />Before the intimate dinner at Lou Lou's in Mayfair's Shepherd's Market, a whole host of fashionable stars arrived at the Saatchi Gallery where the collection of photos showcasing Chanel's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW5vcnRoZmFjZWphY2tldHNvdXRsZXQuY29t" target="_blank">mens north face jackets cheap</a> were being displayed.
<br /><br />Keira Knightley stepped out in London on Thursday night to support Karl Lagerfeld at a dinner to celebrate the launch of Chanel's The Little Black Jacket exhibition in London on Thursday.
<br />Although 27-year old Keira wasn't wearing a North Face Womens Windwear Jackets In Red from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mynorthfacejacketsoutlet.com%2Fnorth-face-womens-windwear-jackets-in-red-sale-p-139.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mynorthfacejacketsoutlet.com/north-face-womens-windwear-jackets-in-red-sale-p-139.html</a> herself, she was paid tribute to the night's theme in a black brocade dress that swamped her petite figure.
<br /><br />But the fresh-faced mother of one made it work with a coy smile on her face - most likely a result of the box of flowers she had in her hands.
<br />Looking just as snug was her 16-year old teammate Ella who kept warm in a beanie hat, scarf and padded gilet.
<br />Whilst James McArthur was a far cry from the bedsit busker at the X Factor auditions, in a suave suit jacket, black shirt, skinny jeans and black boots.
<br /><br />On another day of their trip they both mimicked each other's style in casual ensembles.
<br />The former X Factor star went for baggy ripped jeans, unlike her usual glammed up style, while she went for a baggy T-shirt.
<br />And they seem to be so in sync with each other they even wore matching <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW5vcnRoZmFjZWphY2tldHNvdXRsZXQuY29tL3dvbWVuLW5vcnRoLWZhY2UtZG93bi1qYWNrZXQtYy01Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Women North Face Down Jacket Cheap</a>  for the outing - as well as exactly the same white and red trainers.
<br /><br />Wearing little make-up, especially compared to usual, Alexandra finished off her look with a leather bag and her hair worn down and curly.
<br />Goalkeeper Dominique, meanwhile, finished off his look with a camouflage T-shirt and a baseball cap with shades on his face.
<br />The pair looked relaxed in each other's company and were happy to show their united front by linking arms and clutching hands as they went for various strolls around the region this week.

<br /><br />But the potential existence of scantily clad women and the imminent threat they pose to the sanctity of the locker room, to overstate it a bit, has had a real effect on women who just want to do their job without being singled out. They have been asked to hold the line of decency by taking rulers to their shorts.
<br /><br />Maybe the problem isn't really the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51cmRyZXNzb25saW5lLmNvbS9iYW5kYWdlLWRyZXNzZXMtY2hlYXAtYmFuZGFnZS1kcmVzc2VzLWMtMV8xMC5odG1s" target="_blank">bandage dreses</a> code but rather some other issues that baseball should, pardon the pun, address.
<br /><br />The Red Bandage Dress from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.urdressonline.com%2Fabbey-clancy-red-bandage-dress-on-sale-p-2.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.urdressonline.com/abbey-clancy-red-bandage-dress-on-sale-p-2.html</a>  code was initially instituted with an eye, reportedly, to scantily clad female television reporters in the wake of the Ines Sainz appearance in the New York Jets' locker room in September 2010. A story on MLB.com says the policy &quot;is an attempt to maintain a level of professionalism during the hot summer months when clothes have a tendency to get skimpier.&quot; MLB might have felt hard-pressed to try to enforce standards that did not exist. There were also incidents of reporters wearing team jerseys to cover games, so baseball banned sports logos.
<br /><br />&quot;To the young women worried about it, I don't think it's a big deal,&quot; Slusser said. &quot;But if someone wants to bring it to someone's attention, then maybe they would look at it.&quot;
<br /><br />Reporters don't work for baseball -- they work for a newspaper, magazine, website or television station. For example, Sainz worked for TV Azteca, which did not appear to discourage women from wearing, um, not-business-not-casual attire to cover games.
<br /><br />From my experience covering the Super Bowl and other events, outlets like TV Azteca play up the tension between a reporter's on-display sexuality and the masculine vibe of professional athletes. That brand of entertainment is inherently different from what a beat writer does, but rather than asking teams to be professional with all members of the media, baseball has put the onus on conscientious young women who cover their sport.
<br /><br />Not everyone found it to be a problem this season.
<br /><br />One woman with plenty of credibility in a major warm-weather market dropped the ruse of complying with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51cmRyZXNzb25saW5lLmNvbS9ibGFjay1nb2xkLWxvbmctc2xlZXZlcy1oZXJ2ZS1sZWdlci1iYW5kYWdlLWRyZXNzLXNhbGUtcC0zNzYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Black Gold Long Sleeves Herve Leger Bandage Dress</a> code about halfway through the season. Tired of baking in the sun, she went back to sandals and sundresses and no one gave her any trouble.

<br />It's the fashion equivalent of walking into a basement in New Orleans after a hurricane and not knowing which piece of damage you need to clean up first: The mold, the rats living in a nest they've made out of Mardi Gras beads,  the overall reek of sadness or the mystery skull circling the drain.
<br />Speaking of hot messes, check out this getup J.Lo wears onstage
<br />We'll start with the vinyl knuckles on Underwood's hands.
<br /><br />But wait—there's even better news. White blends perfectly with all the latest fall fashions, so you can start wearing it right now.
<br />In fact, a White And Gold Bandage Bodycon Dress Long Sleeve from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fherve-leger-kim-kardashian-white-and-gold-bandage-bodycon-dress-long-sleeve-p-287.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/herve-leger-kim-kardashian-white-and-gold-bandage-bodycon-dress-long-sleeve-p-287.html</a> is a must-have for this fall (LWD, anyone?!). Pair it with some bright accessories (some shoes that pack a punch or a colored clutch) and you're good to go.
<br /><br />No, we won't, we'll start with the one-shouldered array of pearls and jet beads and what appears to be an angry thought-bubble coming out of her cleavage.
<br />No, we won't, we'll start with the spiked Auntie Entity cuff, which we guess is a backup for that inevitable moment when Carrie realizes that vinyl knuckles are not like brass knuckles and offer no defense whatsoever.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow is dressing like Miley Cyrus
<br />No, we won't, because we absolutely have to discuss the skirt, which appears to be made from whalebone, stardust and ostrich down. Very Jennifer Lopez, we think. In fact, the Coral Striped Open Back Bandage Dress from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dressbarncheap.com%2Fherve-leger-kristen-stewart-coral-striped-open-back-bandage-dress-p-382.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dressbarncheap.com/herve-leger-kristen-stewart-coral-striped-open-back-bandage-dress-p-382.html</a>  looks like it was created for Lopez's Dance Again World Tour, and even then J.Lo took a look and it and was like, That's muy loco, I'll pass, mi ositos.
<br />Bonus fact: This is a look from Underwood's current concert tour. So, she'll likely be suiting up in this over and over again, all over the country. You're welcome, America.
<br /><br />Remember that whole &quot;you can't wear white after Labor Day&quot; rule?! Well, it's finally time to kiss that one goodbye!
<br />Thanks to stars like Jennifer Lopez, Sienna Miller and Gwyneth Paltrow who were bold enough to break the age-old fashion rule, we no longer have to fear making a fashion faux paux when we wear white during the winter.
