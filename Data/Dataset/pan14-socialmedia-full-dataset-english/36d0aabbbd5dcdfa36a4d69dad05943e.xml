Running tubes requires that you run screws through your bead. To prevent stress creep from ripping available your valvestems. 10-12 self tapping S. S. screws equally spaced in the bead on BOTH sides with the wheel should do just fine. Make sure the screws you make use of are long enough to go through the rim but not so long as to puncture the stress. Something around a #12 hex face x 1/2&quot;-3/4&quot; length ought to be good, (make positive you check though). Make sure to have your new wheels and tires professionally well-balanced before hitting the competition track. Self sticking wheel weights work better than the hammer on kind most tire stores use. You might want to take some up and bring them with you when you go to have them mounted. <br /><br />Now that your Mustang has brand-new shoes, its time to air them up. Buy a high quality tire pressure gauge made specifically for drag racing. The old pencil/stick type gauge is just not going to cut the idea anymore! My recommendation is to start on the high side with the pressure range (Do not exceed maximum pressure) together with gradually lower the pressure 1-2 psi at any given time. Keep checking your 60' circumstances, look for the pressure that gives you the quickest period. After that you will vary pressures by 1/2 pound each time to perfect your vehicle. Be wary of the truth that a drag slick using low air pressure can be a hairy ride that takes a little getting used to, be careful! By now you ought to have lowered your ET by several tenth's of an second at least. Keep reading along with me and I'll bring you my best racing tips and techniques to make you the king in the strip! <br /><br />Copyright 2010 by Tommy Gambon <br />.<br />Do you like mountain biking?

If yes, read on this article which offers you a few useful tips on the tires. <br /><br />After experiencing chosen what they feel is the perfect tire, riders often operate the same tire for all conditions. This may not be a bad idea if you are continuously riding on the same terrain. However, once you will ride different conditions, you would like different tread. The best way to discover what works best for your riding or racing conditions is to actually experience riding with different tires. If you get the chance, ride a component of a trail on one type of tire and then move tires and ride which same section. Try a different tire on the front than relating to the rear; it may be your very best selection. <br /><br />Typically, muddy conditions require tread containing small lugs, spaced considerably apart. Wide spacing enables the mud to clear with the tread without building in place, while still getting some traction. (Lugs, for anybody who are not familiar with the jargon, are the knobs in the tires.) Hard-pack conditions, when the dirt can be a little wet or ugly, are best for high-speed using. <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5hdG9tLmNvbS9Qb3N0L0hvdy1jYW4teW91LWdldC10aGUtYmVzdC10aXJlLWRlYWxzLzAzRUZCRkZGRjAyNUI4QTg1MDAwODAxOEM2QkM3" target="_blank">Custom Wheel and Tire Packages</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FiZHVsbGFyYTgyMC5oeXZlcy5ubC9ibG9nLzQ5MjU2NzA4L0N1c3RvbV9XaGVlbF9hbmRfVGlyZV9QYWNrYWdlcy9Da0t0Lz9wYWdlaWQ9QjJGSEFKRDY1TDQ0U09DTzA_" target="_blank">Custom Wheel and Tire Packages</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdWtlYm94YWxpdmUuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2Jsb2dfaWQ9NjYxNjczMw__" target="_blank">Custom Wheel and Tire Packages</a>Tire Coupons are a typical promotional strategy adopted as a result of many tire companies.
