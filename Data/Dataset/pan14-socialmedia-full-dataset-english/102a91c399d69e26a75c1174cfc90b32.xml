Of course, everything is a little tricky when it comes to managing a cat. They’re not much on appreciating your efforts to clean or medicate them, or bathe them; or just basically anything they didn’t ask you for. They prefer you to feed them when they say so, pet them when they say so, and the rest of the time, leave them alone. When your cat gets fleas, then you can say you’ve got a problem!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beyondfleas.com%2Fflea-powder-good-for-your-carpet-not-for-your-pet"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondfleas.com/flea-powder-good-for-your-carpet-not-for-your-pet</a> <br /><br />Seriously, the most important thing to know about cats before any flea treatment is administered, is that you never, ever put anything on the cat that was made for a dog. The active flea killing ingredients are totally different. The chemicals in dog flea products will hurt your cat. <br /><br />They may start screaming because their skin is burning; now you have to give them a bath; or another bath as the case may be. They may break out around their necks, chest and above the tail, and guess what; they will scratch and make sores everywhere and then their hair will fall out. Have you ever seen a bald cat covered in scabs; believe it, you don’t want to!<br /><br />Flea treatments for cats come in powder, spray, shampoo, flea collars and spot treatments. They come in all kinds of varieties and prices. One rule to remember, if it’s cheap, it will not work! So, forget the 99 cent store; waste of 99 cents. <br /><br />The big box and grocery stores have cheaper discount products; don’t bother, waste of $5 or so dollars. These stores along with discount pet stores have more expensive products that can provide some relief, extremely temporary relief. That would be the shampoos (lot of fun there), sprays and spot treatments. <br /><br />Totally disregard flea collars; they don’t work and most cats are allergic (more rash, more scabs). Whoever invented that flea powder must have been insane; does a cat look like a baby’s butt that needs powdering? NO! The powders do not work, but go ahead and use one if you’re really bored; it’ll give you something to do later. <br /><br />You can run all over vacuuming while you watch the cat sneeze and gag and puke; then guess what? You get to clean it up. The cat does not care, and at this point, is probably not, liking you very much anymore. Trust me, that cat is sitting over there in the corner thinking about getting even!<br /><br />The only reasonable options are top quality spray (fun!) and/or shampoo (more fun!) and spot treatments.  Purchase these items from the veterinarian or the local farm supply (they have the same product as the vet). Not cheap, but believe me, you want it to work the first time.  Next, if you don’t know, you need to know now; the cat is going to have a fit! The only thing they despise worse than a spray bottle is, guess what, a bath. <br /><br />If you have never bathed a cat, you are in for a treat! One helpful hint for bathing a cat is, use a harness, not a collar on them. The harness will allow you to hold them by the part of the harness that is on their back, and hopefully keep you from getting bitten or scratched too badly. You have no idea how a cat can contort its body, but you are about to find out. <br /><br />You can skip all of this, if you just go and pick up one of those $30 pills that you force down their throat once a month and call it a job well done, fleas bites cat, flea dies.

A few years ago, well maybe more than a few, there was one flea solution for dogs that was commonly used. It was a nasty solution, literally. Dip, what can you say about the dip? What the ingredients were is anybody’s guess. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beyondfleas.com%2Fcat-flea-treatment"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondfleas.com/cat-flea-treatment</a> <br /><br />The stuff had the nastiest chemical smell; loud enough that you had to wonder if it would kill you if it got on you. Forget the poor dog. The dogs lived through it, as amazing as that sounds; and believe it, there is no such thing as a flea that can survive the dip! It’s doubtful if anyone is using that product anymore, it’s probably classified as an environmental hazard now.<br /><br />In the modern world, there are a lot of options some really good, some good, some not so good and some that are really not so good.<br /><br />How about the really not so good first? If it came from the local 99 cent store, don’t bother, it won’t work. They actually have flea collars, shampoo and spray. Forget it! They won’t work and your dog will not thank you.<br /><br />Now for the just, not so good; products in the pet aisle at the grocery or big box store. The reasonably priced and discount products are not very much better than the ones at the 99 cent store. The shampoo or spray may kill the fleas or just make them jump off the dog, but they have no power to keep them off (on the label it says they will continue to work for x number of days-don’t you believe it!); the fleas will be back on the dog in an hour or less. <br /><br />And the flea collars or spot treatments in this price range? Forget it. You will never know you even bothered to put it on the dog; so once again, no thanks will be forthcoming from said dog. <br /><br />Some of the good options you might try are also found at the big box, grocery or discount pet store. These products are beginning to get a little expensive for what you get, however they do work, to a certain extent. The shampoos and spray work well, and if used in conjunction with the spot treatments, will kill the fleas and might keep them off for a week, if your dog is lucky. <br /><br />The flea collars; they’re a no. This can get expensive really quick. If you have tried all these things in your fight against fleas, then one has to wonder; have you succeeded in your dedicated quest to poison that dog yet? If not, then we have another option.<br /><br />The really good option, is naturally, not cheap; the veterinarian, or the farm and feed store. They have quality products that really work. Professional grade shampoos, sprays and spot treatments. They even work for a while, you can’t really say they will work as long as the label implies, but they’ll get pretty close to working as they advertise. According to most people the absolute best option is a pill. <br /><br />This is a once a month pill; when the fleas get on the dog and bite, the flea dies before it can lay eggs on the dog. Flea free dog; that’s what you get and this time that dog just might thank you (not while you’re cramming that pill down his throat, by the way, but maybe after). Now this option is a pill a month for about $30 a month; not cheap, but it is effective.
