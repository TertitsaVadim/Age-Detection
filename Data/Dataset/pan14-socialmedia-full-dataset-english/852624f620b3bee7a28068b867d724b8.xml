<br />I read this and I feel this is very important to everyone in everyday life.
<br /><br />So, I summarized the 10 points as below :
<br /><br />1.Not eating enough protein, especially early in the day. 
<br /><br />2.Skipping breakfast.
<br /><br />3.Skipping other meals because you didn't think ahead. 
<br /><br />4.Eating carbohydrates(sugar) only.
<br /><br />5.Thinking in terms of &quot;snacks&quot; packaged in boxes and bags.
<br /><br />6.Consuming cheap, empty-calorie carbohydrates.
<br />(example: Non-diet soda, potato chips, cookies, popcorn, and white bread)
<br /><br />7. Falling for the fat-free gimmick.
<br />(usually non-fat food will still make you fat. How? more sugar it contains!.) 
<br /><br />8.Not &quot;fishing&quot; for healthy protein. 
<br />(Generally speaking, plant fats are healthier than animal fats. But the fats in fish are an exception, especially those from darker fleshed ones like salmon. The omega-3 fatty acids they contain are just what the doctor ordered to keep your ticker ticking. In the meantime, substitute fish for another animal protein several times a week and supplement with omega-3s for good measure.)
<br /><br />9.Not drinking enough water. 
<br /><br />10.Shopping in the center of the supermarket.
<br />(just shopping, grabbing goods from there.--unless you need shampoo, styling cream, or stationery. Eventually tuna is good but canned one already crowded with chemicals and processed.)
<br />(Actually you should also visit green corner, pick some fruits or vegetables and cook it yourself)

<br /><br />Your naturally expansive nature gets a dose of mystery and self-protection in the Month of the Snake. It can be difficult to communicate your true feelings this month. True friends care deeply. They want to hear what you are feeling. Being open and honest helps resolve conflicts and brings peace of mind. Not sharing can leave you lonely and depressed. You have a deeply spiritual side. Snake increases your natural intuition and compassion. Now is time to appreciate the beauty of life. Believe that you are loved and protected. Act on your first impulses. Snake supports your determination and willingness to stick with difficult situations. Pick your battles carefully. Forgive and forget all you can. Get outside as much as possible. It is time to appreciate the beauty of nature. You may want to become more active in efforts to protect and improve your community. You can make a difference.

<br /><br />Birth Date:
<br />January 31, 1981
<br /><br />As an outgoing Aquarius with the Moon in party-animal Sagittarius and charismatic Leo on the Ascendant, it comes as no shock that Justin Timberlake has garnered a reputation as a bad boy. His romantic liaisons – which include past relationships with pop and film divas Britney Spears, Alyssa Milano and Cameron Diaz – are legend, and, with his Leonian good looks, he's very likely to attract a lot more. 
<br /><br />Timberlake began his performing career in 1989's The New Mickey Mouse Club, where he met future band-mate J.C. Chasez. Later, he and Chasez re-entered the spotlight when they formed the pop band 'N Sync, and in 2000 released the smash hit album No Strings Attached. In 2002, Timberlake began work on his first solo album, Justified, which eventually went double platinum. Four years later, his second solo album, Future Sex/Love Sounds, which contained the #1 hit singles &quot;Sexy Back&quot; and &quot;My Love,&quot; debuted at the top of the Billboard charts. He has won no fewer than eleven Grammy awards, and has also appeared in several films, including Black Snake Moan, Alpha Dog and Southland Tales.
<br /><br />Yet with Jupiter and Saturn, the business planets, conjunct in Libra in his financial sector, he does have his serious, business-oriented side. He has opened several restaurants, launched the William Rast clothing line, and started his own record company, JayTee Records. And the caring, altruistic side of Aquarius has not passed him by. In late 2005, Justin’s humanitarian activities in his native Tennessee earned him an award from the Grammy Association. 
<br /><br />And take heart, girls: After his recent split with Cameron Diaz, Justin is unattached! Here is a tip from Justin himself: &quot;A lot of girls have cheated on me in the past, so it's hard for me to trust. But once I fall, I fall hard.&quot; If you can get him to fall for you, with loyal and romantic Leo on the Ascendant, he’ll be yours for life!

<br /><br />Just as you get up to leave because you have to work the next day, one of your friends buys another round -- one of your *unemployed* friends. Here, at level one, you think to yourself, &quot;Oh come on, this is silly, as long as I get seven hours of sleep, I'll be fine.&quot;
<br /><br />LEVEL 2: It's midnight. You've had a few more beers.
<br /><br />You've just spent 20 minutes arguing against the use of artificial turf. You get up to leave again, but at level two, a little devil appears on your shoulder. And now you're thinking, &quot;Hey! I'm out with my friends! What am I working for anyway? These are the good times! Besides, as long as I get five hours of sleep, I'm cool.&quot;
<br /><br />LEVEL 3: 1am. You've abandoned beer for tequila.
<br /><br />You've just spent 20 minutes arguing FOR the use of artificial turf. And now you're thinking, &quot;Our waitress is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen!&quot;
<br /><br />At level three, you love the world. On the way to the bathroom, you buy a drink for the stranger at the end of the bar just because you like his face. You get drinking fantasies (like, &quot;Hey fellas, if we bought our own bar, we could live together forever. We could do it. Tommy, you could cook.&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />. But at level three, that devil is a little bit bigger... and he's buying. And you're thinking, &quot;Oh, come on, come on now. As long as I get three hours of sleep... and a complete change of blood, I'm cool.&quot;
<br /><br />LEVEL 4: 2am. And the devil is bartending.
<br /><br />For last call, you ordered a bottle of rum and a Coke. You ARE artificial turf!
<br /><br />This time, on your way to the bathroom, you punch the stranger at the end of the bar just because you don't like his face! And now you're thinking, &quot;Our busboy is the best looking man I've ever seen.&quot; You and your friends decide to leave, right after you get thrown out, and one of you knows an afterhours bar.
<br /><br />Here, at level four, you actually think to yourself, &quot;Well... as long as I'm only going to get a few hours sleep anyway, I may as well stay up all night! Yeah! That'd be good for me. I don't mind going to that board meeting looking like Keith Richards. Yeah, I'll turn that around, make it work for me. And besides, as long as I get 31 hours sleep tomorrow, I'm cool.&quot;
<br /><br />LEVEL 5: 5am. 
<br /><br />After unsuccessfully trying to get your money back at the tattoo parlor (&quot;But I don't even know anybody named Simon!&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />, you and your friends wind up across the state line in a bar with guys who have been in prison as recently as... that morning. It's the kind of place where even the devil is saying, &quot;Uh, I gotta turn in. I gotta be in Hell by nine.&quot;
<br /><br />At this point, you're all drinking some kind of thick blue liquor, like something from a Klingon wedding. A waitress with fresh stitches comes over, and you think to yourself, &quot;Someday I'm gonna marry that girl!&quot; One of your friends stands up and screams, &quot;WE'RE DRIVIN' TO VEGAS, BABY!!!!!&quot; -- and passes out.
<br /><br />You crawl outside for air, and then you hit the worst part of level 5 -- the sun. You weren't expecting that were you? You never do. You walk out of a bar in daylight, and you see people on their way to work or worse, jogging. And they look at you and they know. And they say, &quot;Who's Simon?&quot; Let's be honest, if you're 19 and you stay up all night, it's like a victory -- you've beat the night. But if you're over 30, then that sun is like God's flashlight.
<br /><br />We all say the same prayer and then, &quot;I swear, I will never do this again as long as I live!&quot; And some of us have that little addition, &quot;and this time, I mean it!&quot;
<br /><br />Enjoy it!
<br />thanks to MP!
