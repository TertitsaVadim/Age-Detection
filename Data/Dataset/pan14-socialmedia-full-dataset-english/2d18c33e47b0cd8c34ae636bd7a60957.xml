<br />Guy: No, this is fun.
<br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary!
<br />Guy: Then tell me you love me.
<br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down!
<br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
<br />Girl : *hugs him*
<br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me.
<br />Girl: Alright, now slow down
<br />Guy: I love you babe
<br /><br />(in the paper the next day):
<br />A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived.
<br /><br />The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.

What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would be 10 moments of sadness? What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life. I look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you. Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you. Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will. Remember, everyone needs a friend. dont ever leave the one u love for the one u like, because the one u like will leave u for the one they love.
<br />If you wake up in a red room with no windows and doors, DON'T panic.. you're just in my heart!!! Send this to all the friends you want to keep forever... Only if you want to send it though.

Kiss on the neck I want you  4. Kiss on the lips I love you  5. Kiss on the ears I am just playing  6. Kiss anywhere else lets not get carried away  7. Look in your eyes kiss me  8.Playing with your hair I can't live without you  9. Hand on your waist I love you to much to let you go   Article 2: The Three Steps 1. Girls: If any guys gets fresh with you, slap him.   2. Guys: If any girl slaps you, her intentions are still good.   3. Guys &amp; Girls: Close your eyes when kissing, it is rude to stare.   Article 3:The Commandments 1. Thou shall not squeeze too hard.  2. Thou shall not ask for a kiss, but take one.  3. Thou shall kiss at every opportunity.   * Remember *A peach is a peachA plum is a plum,A kiss isn't a kissWithout some tongue.So open up your mouthclose your eyes,and give your tonguesome exercise!!!   Here are a few reasons why guys like girls:   1. They will always smell good even if its just shampoo 2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder 3. How cute they look when they sleep 4. The ease in which they fit into our arms 5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in theworld 6. How cute they are when they eat 7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it makes it allworth while 8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside 9. The way they look good no matter what they wear 10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that youthink she's the most beautiful thing on this earth 11. How cute they are when they argue 12. The way her hand always finds yours 13. The way they smile 14. The way you feel when you see their name on the caller ID after you justhad a big fight 15. The way she says &quot;lets not fight anymore&quot; even though you know that anhour later.... 16. The way they kiss when you do something nice for them 17. The way they kiss you when you say &quot;I love you&quot; 18. Actually ... just the way they kiss you... 19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry 20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly 21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt 22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt. (even though we don'tadmit it)! 23. The way they say &quot;I miss you&quot; 24. The way you miss them 25.The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn'thurt her anymore..... Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish theywould die or know that you would die without them... it matters not. Becauseonce in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything toyou. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their soulsand you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that yourown life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her veryheart.We love them for a million reasons, No paper would do it justice. Itis a thing not of the mind but of the heart. A feeling. Only felt.

<br />girls who think they don't look good... It hurts... because it's
<br />our fault, guys I mean. We make girls feel like they have
<br />to be perfect. You know what I mean, flat stomach, big boobs,
<br />round booty, long legs, sexy lips, and on top of all that,
<br />they have to dress like a whore, and be one as well... nobody can
<br />measure up to that... and it's not fair... because nobody should
<br />have to. The little imperfections are what make people special.
<br />If everyone was perfect the world would be so boring, variety is
<br />what makes life interesting. So guys, stop making girls have to
<br />live up to your, I'm sorry, our... deluded fantasy visions of
<br />perfection. Stop acting like boys and start being men... realize
<br />that women don't exist to fulfill our sexual desires. Stop talking
<br />to them solely to get with them, be nice to them because you want
<br />to be their friend, not because you want to hook up with them. Say
<br />nice things about them not to flatter them in hopes that you'll
<br />get some, but because you know they like to hear them. In short...
<br />we need to grow up and stop acting like freaking retarded little
<br />boys.
<br />- - - - - -
<br />girls who agree repost. and to the few guys who have balls
<br />and agree also repost it

<br />This is to all of the girls in the world who can't accept the nice guys for who they are:
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I was raised with respect;
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That my body's not ripped enough
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />that I open your car door,
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I'm not cute enough
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot;
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am actually nice;
<br />not an asshole
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I don't have a huge bank account
<br />to buy you expensive things
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />When your all alone
<br />and i am the only one to comfort you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />I would rather make love to you then just f**k you
<br />like some random guy.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to,
<br />but never good enough to date
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car,
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere,
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That I don't understand that he cheats on you but you take him back;
<br />but I'm not good enough to understand that he loves you
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I start not being there, and being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new asshole comes around
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you think i dont care any more
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If I don't answer my phone when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work
<br /><br />I'm sorry that you can't realize.I've been the only one there all along.
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this
<br />but don't care
<br />But most of all
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />For not being sorry anymore
<br /><br />I'm sorry
<br />That you can't accept me
<br />for who I am
<br /><br />Ladies always bitch and bitch to their friends that there is never any good guys out there anymore, and they always end up with assholes who treat them bad. Well ladies next time your bitching, maybe look up to see who your bitching too, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word like usual, screaming in his head &quot;why don't you give me a try?&quot;
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.
<br /><br />If you're a guy and you agree with this letter, repost as &quot;I'm sorry&quot; and add a little if I forgot something
<br /><br />If You're one of the few girls with enough balls to repost, and you would never make your guy feel this way, repost as &quot;I appreciate the nice guys
