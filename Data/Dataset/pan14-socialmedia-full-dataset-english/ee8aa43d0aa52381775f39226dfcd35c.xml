<br />A drop of  tear to weep
<br />Reminds me of you.
<br />A long side a sigh
<br />A long side of cry
<br /><br />A soft summer rain, a smile that hides a pain
<br />Why should you be a shamed
<br />Cause in every life.
<br />A little rain must fall
<br />And u r my friend
<br />Charmingly sentimental brain
<br /><br />There’s truth behind a cry
<br />And there’s a cry behind a lie
<br />On every words that come out strong
<br />Just let them go and lets get a long
<br /><br />On every grudge and every fight
<br />I miss u all day and night
<br />Have you had ur  time off  today
<br />To bring a cup of tea and smile away
<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder
<br />Will i ever c u
<br />Without all ur game plan
<br />When all u hv is
<br />Nothing but a pure bliss
<br /><br />I will wait that day
<br />When you can find your way
<br />Out of this maze of love
<br />And u can  laugh
<br />To see cries and lies
<br />Cz u know better than me
<br />Only the truth will set u free
<br /><br />I know u know, u know i know
<br /><br />On every thought that come out  wrong
<br />Just learn from it and please stay strong
<br />There’s a hope on every fright
<br />There’s a light on every night</span>

<br />The father was kind  of scared so he asked his little daughter,
<br />'Sweetheart, please  hold my hand so that you don't fall into the river.'
<br />The little  girl said, 'No, Dad. You hold my hand.'
<br />'What's the  difference?' Asked the puzzled father.
<br />'There's a big  difference,' replied the little girl.
<br /><br />'If  I hold your hand and something happens to me,
<br />chances are that  I may let your hand go.
<br />But if you hold my hand, I know for  sure that no matter what happens,
<br />you will never let my hand  go.'
<br /><br />In  any relationship, the essence of trust is not in its bind, but in  its bond.
<br /><br />So  hold the hand of the person who loves you rather than expecting  them to hold yours...
<br />This message is too short......but  carries a lot of Feelings.

<br />'This, - he said - isn't any ordinary package.'
<br />He unwrapped the box n stared at both the silk paper n the box.
<br />'She got this the first time we went to New York, 8 or 9 years ago. She has never put it on, was saving it for a special occasion'.
<br />Well, I guess this is it.
<br />He got near the bed n placed the gift box next to the other clothing he was taking to the funeral house, his wife had just died.
<br />He turned to me and said: 'Never save something for a special occasion. Every day in ur life is a special occasion'.
<br />I still think those words changed my life. Now I read more n clean less.
<br />I sit on the porch without worrying about anything. I spend more time with my family n less at work.
<br />I understood that life should be a source of experience to be lived up to, not survived through.
<br />I no longer keep anything. I use crystal glasses every day...
<br />I'll wear new clothes to go to the supermarket, if I feel like it.
<br />I don't save my special perfume for special occasions, I use it whenever I want to.
<br />The words 'Someday..' and ' One Day...' are fading away from my dictionary.
<br />If it's worth seeing, listening or doing, I want to see, listen or do it now.....
<br />I don't know what my friend's wife would have done if she knew she wouldn't be there the next morning, this nobody can tell.
<br />I think she might have called her relatives and closest friends.
<br />She might call old friends to make peace over past quarrels.
<br />I'd like to think she would go out for Chinese, her favourite food.
<br />It's these small things that I would regret not doing, if I knew my time had come.
<br />Each day, each hour, each minute, is special.
<br />Live for today, for tomorrow is promised to no-one.</span>

<br />Love is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it eludes you.  But if you just let it fly, it will come to you when you least expect it.  Love can make you happy but often it hurts, but love's only special when you give it to someone who is really worth it. So take your time and choose the best.
<br /><br />To My Friends Who Are........... <strong>NOT SO SINGLE</strong>
<br />Love isn't about becoming somebody else's &quot;perfect person.&quot; It's about finding someone who helps you become the best person you can be.
<br /><br />To My Friends Who Are.......... <strong>PLAYBOY/GIRL TYPE</strong>
<br />Never say &quot;I love you&quot; if you don't care. Never talk about feelings if they aren't there. Never touch a life if you mean to break a heart.   Never look in the eye when all you do is lie. The cruelest thing a guy can do to a girl is to let her fall in love when he doesn't intend to catch her fall and it works both ways...
<br /><br />To My Friends who are............. <strong>MARRIED</strong>
<br />Love is not about &quot;it's your fault&quot;, but &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Not &quot;where are you&quot;, but &quot;I'm right here.&quot; Not &quot;how could you&quot;, but &quot;I underst and.&quot; Not &quot;I wish you were&quot;, but &quot;I'm thankful you are.&quot;
<br /><br />To My Friends who are............<strong>ENGAGED</strong>
<br />The true measure of compatibility is not the years spent together but how good you are for each other.
<br /><br />To My Friends Who Are............<strong>HEARTBROKEN</strong>
<br />Heartbreaks last as long as you want and cut as deep as you allow them to go. The challenge is not how to survive heartbreaks but to learn from them.
<br /><br />To My Friends Who Are.........<strong>NAIVE</strong>
<br />How to be in love: Be able but don't stumble, be consistent but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, and get hurt but never keep the pain.
<br /><br />To My Friends Who Are............<strong>POSSESSIVE</strong>
<br />It breaks your heart to see the one you love happy with someone else but it's more painful to know that the one you love is unhappy with you.
<br /><br />To My Friends who are…….<strong>AFRAID TO CONFESS</strong>
<br />Love hurts when you break up with someone. It hurts even more when someone breaks up with you. But love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel.
<br /><br />To My Friends who are............<strong>STILL HOLDING ON</strong>
<br />A sad t hing about life is when you meet someone and fall in love, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and that you have wasted years on someone who wasn't worth it. If he isn't worth it now he's not going to be worth it a year or 10 years from now. Let go.....
<br /><br /><strong>TO ALL MY FRIENDS.......</strong>
<br />My wish for you is a man/woman whose love is honest, strong, mature, never-changing, uplifting, protective, encouraging, rewarding and unselfish.</span>

<br />It's ok to let a fool kiss you,
<br />but never ever let a kiss fool you....
<br /><br />It's still best to wait for the one you want
<br />than settle for the one available.
<br />Best to wait for the one you love
<br />than settle for one who's around.
<br />Best to wait for the right one.
<br />Life is short to waste on the wrong person....
<br /><br />It is better to meet the person who will truly love you later,
<br />than meet someone now who promises to love
<br />you but sooner or later leave you forever.....
<br /><br />Never try to impress someone to make him/her fall in love with you
<br />If you do, you will be expected to keep the standard for the rest of your life...
<br /><br />Fate determines who comes into our lives. The heart determines who stays...</span>
