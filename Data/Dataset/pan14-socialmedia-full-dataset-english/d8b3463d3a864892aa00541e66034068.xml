<br /><br />In loving memory of Mark Bevis 
<br /><br />Mark was a great  friend and collegue and he passed away on saturday morning 29.11.08.
<br />he will be sorly missed by many as he was a really funny person always making people laugh and always smiling.
<br /><br />He was type of guy that when every one else was panicing  he would be joking around calling people sausage and saying he works with penguins or ferrets.
<br /><br />i have known him 11+ years and he was a good friend to me and looked after me and always was there to support me when i needed facilities.
<br /><br />his life was going well until he developed a  brain tumor that he got rid of through kemo but it came back and spread to his back and he also developed balsepalsy which really got him down he hated it but he stayed active coming into work and helping.
<br /><br />but towards the end he got really ill and ended up bed ridden and always sleepy 
<br />he was given 4 weeks to live and told he was going into wheat feilds hospise.
<br />we was told on the thursday that he would not make it till christmas and on the saturday he passed away.
<br /><br />he was 45 yrs old and has left a daughter holly 15yrs old she will miss her dad as they was very close.
<br /><br />he was well loved man  by all that knew him.
<br /><br />God bless those that are in morning of this great guy and to all those that did not know him you missed the chance to talk to a really nice guy.
<br /><br />from your
<br />Loyal friend

<br />but that we are powerful beyond measure.
<br /><br />It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us.
<br />We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant,
<br />gorgeous, handsome, talented and fabulous?
<br /><br />Actually, who are you not to be?
<br />You are a child of God.
<br /><br />Your playing small does not serve the world.
<br />There is nothing enlightened about shrinking
<br />so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
<br /><br />We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us.
<br />It is not just in some; it is in everyone.
<br /><br />And, as we let our own light shine, we consciously give
<br />other people permission to do the same.
<br /><br />As we are liberated from our fear,
<br />our presence automatically liberates others.

<br /><br />This is important information for females of ALL ages.
<br /><br />When this was sent to me, I was told to forward it to my lady friends, but I forwarded it to most everyone in my address book. My men friends have female friends and this information is too important to miss someone.
<br />Please pass it along.
<br /><br />A group of rapists and date rapists in prison were interviewed on what they look for in a potential victim and here are some interesting facts:
<br /><br />1) The first thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle. They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed. They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.
<br /><br />2) The second thing men look for is clothing. They will look for women whose clothing is easy to remove quickly. Many of them carry scissors around specifically to cut clothing.
<br /><br />3) They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their purse, or doing other activities while walking because they are off-guard and can be easily overpowered.
<br /><br />4) Men are most likely to attack &amp; rape in the early morning, between 5:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m.
<br /><br />5) The number one place women are abducted from/attacked is grocery store parking lots. Number two: Are office parking lots/garages. Number three: Are public restrooms.
<br /><br />6) The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to another location where they don't have to worry about getting caught.
<br /><br />7) Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years.
<br /><br />8) If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming.
<br /><br />9) These men said they would not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in their hands.
<br /><br />Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon. So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it.
<br /><br />10) Several defence mechanisms he taught us are: If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general small talk: 'I can't believe it is so cold out here,' 'we're in for a bad winter.' Now you've seen their face and could identify them in a line-up; you lose appeal as a target.
<br /><br />11) If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front of you and yell STOP or STAY BACK! Most of the rapists this man talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back. Again, they are looking for an EASY target.
<br /><br />12) If you carry pepper spray (this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes), yell I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent.
<br /><br />13) If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them. If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker either under the arm (between the elbow and armpit) OR in the upper inner thigh VERY VERY HARD.  One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands - the guy needed stitches.  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it - it hurts.
<br /><br />14) After the initial hit, always GO for the GROIN. I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's parts it is extremely painful. You might think that you'll anger the guy and make him want to hurt you more, but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble.  Start causing trouble and he's out of there.
<br /><br />15) When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using much pressure, and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly.
<br /><br />16) Of course the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of your surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behaviour, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts!!!
<br /><br />You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble.
<br /><br />1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do: The elbow is the strongest point on your body.  If you are close enough to use it, do!
<br /><br />2.  Learned this from a tourist guide in New Orleans. If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM. Toss it away from you....chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and/or purse than you, and he will go for the wallet/purse. RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!
<br /><br />3.  If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy. The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. This has saved lives.
<br /><br />4.  Women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, or making a list, etc.) DON'T DO THIS! The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go.  AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR, LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE.
<br /><br />a. If someone is in the car with a gun to your head DO NOT DRIVE OFF, repeat: DO NOT DRIVE OFF! Instead gun the engine and speed into anything, wrecking the car. Your Air Bag will save you. If the person is in the back seat they will get the worst of it As soon as the car crashes bail out and run. It is better than having them find your body in a remote location.
<br /><br />5. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot or parking garage:
<br /><br />A.) Be aware: look around you, look into your car, at the passenger side floor, and in the back seat.
<br /><br />B.) If you are parked next to a big van, enter your car from the passenger door.  Most serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars.
<br /><br />C.) Look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, and the passenger side. If a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back into the mall, or work, and get a guard/policeman to walk you back out.
<br /><br />IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.)
<br /><br />6. ALWAYS take the elevator instead of the stairs. (Stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot. This is especially true at NIGHT!)
<br /><br />7. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control, ALWAYS RUN! The predator will only hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times.  And even then, it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. RUN, preferably in a zigzag pattern!
<br /><br />8. As women, we are always trying to be sympathetic: STOP! It may get you raped or killed. Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a good-looking, well-educated man, who ALWAYS played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when he abducted his next victim.
<br /><br />9. Another Safety Point: Someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last, and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird. The police told her 'Whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.'
<br /><br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window, and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over. The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' He told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it, but have had several calls by women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night.
<br /><br />Please pass this on and DO NOT open the door for a crying baby ----This should be taken seriously because the Crying Baby theory was mentioned on America's Most Wanted this past Saturday when they profiled the serial killer in Louisiana.
<br /><br />I'd like you to forward this to all the women you know. It may save a life. A candle is not dimmed by lighting another candle. I was going to send this to the ladies only, but guys, if you love your mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, etc., you may want to pass it onto them, as well

<br />i Started to sing one of my favorite Faith songs &quot;Did you here the mountains tremble&quot;
<br />and thinking about a few things one of them was My Pastor he said in one of the Service &quot;god likes to mix things up ,he puts loud people with quiet people and giggles and says work it out&quot;
<br />and the other thing was my friend Frank he had told me about the story of the good Samaritan.
<br />when i suddenly was hit with a revelation
<br /><br />i said  people seem to look at others and not see whats real
<br /><br />i had an image in my mind about a puzzle  there is a circle hole  and a triangle piece,
<br />the man looking a the Triangle piece was not happy as the Triangle does not fit in the circle hole.
<br /><br />Jesus comes to the man and says &quot;my son whats bothering you&quot;
<br /><br />the man annoyed said  &quot;i have this circle hole and other is this Triangle piece they don't go together&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus laughed and put his hands on the mans eyes and says &quot;look through my hands at the hole and the piece tell me what you see&quot;
<br /><br />The man looks with a confused expression on his face and says &quot;oooooh i see a square hole and a square piece that fit perfectly together&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus removed his Hands and said &quot;do you understand&quot;
<br />the Man looks and says with honesty in is heart &quot;Not really can you explain&quot;
<br /><br />Jesus said &quot;think of this puzzle as in two people one thinks he is a circle and he sees another person who he thinks is a triangle.
<br />he wont talk or help the other person as they're different and would not fit in well with them at all.
<br />he is so focused on their differences he cant see that there is a lot of similarities and could work well together in life people put themselves in categories eg rich,poor,man of faith,man who is faithless and so on.
<br />if people would stop categorizing people and start treating each other as equals the world would be so much better place to live&quot; Jesus then adds &quot;My Father loves every one,he does not care about class,race,sinner,saint he loves every one equally all he wants is for people to choose and love him too live a good life following the word of Christ,but he does not ever give up on people but people who turn back on him cant see him and feel his love,He is the Ultimate he has no limits on the blessings he can bestow on his people he is not limited by conventional laws i will give you an example i had a child come to me all upset i stopped and talked to this child and asked whats was wrong she said my  mum is ill and i want God to help her but my friends are all praying for there mother who is Dying and i don't think he will hear me. with out hesitation i looked at her and said Pray for your mum and there mum God as more power then you can ever understand he can make any thing happen he created this earth and the Galaxy and every thing in it he can help both and he works through his children and listens to all your prayers he knows your deepest thoughts and secrets Just call to him if you need him. i then went into the house to see her mother and put my hand on her head i then prayed to god and said please help this woman Father then i left. the girl came to see me two days later saying her mother was all well and she had improved after my visit i said God blessed her that day and loves to help people don't ever be afraid to ask God for help or seek his guidance he is always there he is omnipresence he is every where ,every time,forever&quot;
<br /><br />Below i have included the Parable of the good Samaritan The priest and the levite was been circles
<br />they was to focused on them selves and consider them self men of faith but would not take the time to help the man. but the Samaritan who they consider a triangle showed compassion and helped the man. on that day that samaritan showed my god like quality then the men of faith.
<br />when we look at the world like the Samaritan and we look after each other there is no triangle and circles we are all gods children and you should love and help everyone as God does.
<br /><br />God asks it to love your neighbor and with the world now as open as it is your neighbor is not just the man next door or even in same country as you its  Global your neighbor to all and all are your neighbor.
<br /><br />Luke 10:25-37
<br /><br />The Parable of the Good Samaritan
<br /> 25On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. &quot;Teacher,&quot; he asked, &quot;what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;
<br /><br />26&quot;What is written in the Law?&quot; he replied. &quot;How do you read it?&quot;
<br /><br />27He answered: &quot; 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'[a]; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[b]&quot;
<br /><br />28&quot;You have answered correctly,&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;Do this and you will live.&quot;
<br /><br />29But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot;
<br /><br />30In reply Jesus said: &quot;A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. 35The next day he took out two silver coins<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/coolbox.gif" alt=":)" /> and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'
<br /><br />36&quot;Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?&quot;
<br /><br />37The expert in the law replied, &quot;The one who had mercy on him.&quot;
<br />      Jesus told him, &quot;Go and do likewise.&quot;
<br /><br />SO DON'T BE A TRIANGLE,CIRCLE YOUR BETTER THEN THAT AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL
<br /><br />Yours Faithfully
<br /><br />Marty
