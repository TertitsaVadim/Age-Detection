<br />I have a stretch and shake my sleepy head
<br />I gracefully clamber out of my hand crafted, personalised resting place
<br />I glare into the mirror but i am unable to see my face
<br />Already dressed in my somewhat unusual attire
<br />I glide down the red carpeted steps feeling grand
<br />I add the coal to the hole in the wall and carefully stoke the now fierce burning fire
<br />It is time for breakfast 
<br />It is time to hunt
<br />Will it be as i have planned ?
<br />What shall i have today ?
<br />Maybe a fluffy white rabbit
<br />Maybe a fearless red box
<br />I try to decide as i lurk in the shadows of a glowing red post box
<br />Maybe a growling black dog
<br />Maybe a purring ginger cat
<br />NO !
<br />I have made my choice 
<br />I will opt for that old weak human in his top hat
<br />Today i think i will have a bit of fun and treat myself 
<br />So with my teeth glistening, sharp and poised 
<br />They protrude from my white see through face
<br />I am ready for the kill
<br />I am going to really enjoy the thrill
<br />Of the chase

<br />Staring, just staring,
<br />I am not looking but I am seeing,
<br />I see the white carpet of winter glistening under the bright light in the sky,
<br />I see the bare arms of the trees reaching out for the warmth,
<br /><br />I am standing at my window,
<br />Staring, just staring,
<br />I am not looking but I am seeing,
<br />I see the day passing by and the light fading away taking the only bit of warmth with it,
<br />I see the white carpet become harsh and crisp and the bare arms of the trees shiver and move about silently,
<br /><br />I am standing at my window,
<br />Staring, just staring,
<br />I am not looking but I am seeing,
<br />I see the curtains being drawn across the night sky and little lights appearing to keep us company and feeling safe in the dark,
<br /><br />It is time now to close my window and pull the covers across,
<br />I whisper, “Goodnight, I will come back tomorrow when the light is bright.”

<br />Cuts on my arm
<br />They’re not healing from this pain
<br />Hurt and harm 
<br />Because its history repeating itself again
<br />Left in the cold
<br />Left in the dark
<br />Left broken apart 
<br />No glimmer of hope 
<br />No sparkle of light at the end of the longing
<br />Worshipping tunnel
<br />This feeling of being shut down 
<br />And left alone 
<br />You’re never around
<br />You’re never home 
<br />Weak from hunger
<br />Weak from pain
<br />But nothing can compare 
<br />To being weak from despair
<br />Take the key 
<br />Unlock the door 
<br />Come and save my closing eyes 
<br />Key in the lock
<br />Hand on the knob
<br />Lips upon lips
<br />Is all thats needed 
<br />For my eyes to open once more 
<br />And there is the glimmer of hope 
<br />The sparkle of light at the end of the tunnel 
<br />To a new beautiful life

<br /><br />When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we don’t see the door which has opened for us.
<br /><br />Don’t go for looks...they can deceive. Don’t go for wealth even that can fade away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.
<br /><br />Dream what you want to dream, go were you want to go, be what you want to be, because you only have one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
<br /><br />I hope you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you humble, and enough hope to make you happy.
<br /><br />The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes there way.
<br /><br />The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can’t go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
<br /><br />When you were born you were crying and everyone around you smiling. Live your life so at the end you’re the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.

<br />The power that lifts us up to the sky above,
<br />The power of our love,

<br />Flying through the sky
<br />High above the clouds
<br />Until
<br />The harsh turbulence of cruel life turned our lives upside down
<br />Forcing our worlds apart
<br />Before you had to leave you promised me this, “On Christmas eve I will meet you hear, beneath this statue at 2am. I will come no matter what.”
<br />So here I am on Christmas Eve
<br />Waiting for your arrival
<br />And there you are, before my eyes, I see you materialise,
<br />I run towards you and go to throw my arms around your muscular torso and shower your full lips with a thousand kisses. 
<br />It is only then do I hear you whisper in your deep husky voice, “I told you I would keep my promise, no matter what.”
<br />And then you disappear into the night.
<br />I sit beneath our statue all alone,
<br />The cold air grasping at my exposed skin.
<br />I start to cry as my frozen fingers dial your number, 
<br />To my surprise you answer with a soothing tone.
<br />“Where are you? Where did you go?” I asked, my voice thick with tears.
<br />And your reply warmed my heart, 
<br />Even just a little,
<br />Although we are miles apart.
<br />It was our love, 
<br />Our connection
<br />And the magic statues that made our worlds apart collide for them few moments
<br />And in doing so, 
<br />Let you keep your promise.
<br />I sit there in the dark and cold,
<br />Beneath our statue and sing our favourite song.
