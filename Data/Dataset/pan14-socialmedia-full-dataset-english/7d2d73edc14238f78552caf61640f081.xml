<br />Believe me it is an art, and although a man wants his girl to be a cougar in the bedroom, he doesn’t want her to come across as slutty and cheap, therefore it is essential to learn the skills, but who do you ask, it’s not really something you can ask your best friend.
<br />Talking dirty, like most of the other things carried out in the privacy of two people sharing intimacy is a learned skill, it is not something we are born with and is instinctive; however with a little practice and a good teacher, it becomes more exciting with each time, and should be a positive experience for both, and if something doesn’t work, try something else.
<br />Until you master it, it is pretty much like sex; trial and error.

<br />For most women it is not something which comes naturally and there may be a lot of hesitancy; indeed, intimacy is so called because it is the closes thing to two minds melding as one and to let yourself go completely is not always an easy thing to do.
<br />Fortunately there is a lot easier way of finding out the niceties or how to talk dirty to your man without having to ask your best friend, or indeed consult the oracle, or say something in the arms of your man and find out it wasn’t the best thing to say and completely spoils the moment.
<br />And it doesn’t include asking his previous girlfriend what he liked and didn’t like her saying.
