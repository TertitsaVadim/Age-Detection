<br /><br />In this article, we’re going to talking about <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NiYXJ0aWNsZXpvbmUuYmxvZ3Nwb3QuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Remove Windows Messenger In Windows Xp</a> .
<br /><br />It seems that a lot of people are interested in removing Windows Messenger for some reason, though I strongly recommend against this: In Windows XP, Windows Messenger will be the hub of your connection to the .NET world, and now that this feature is part of Windows, I think we're going to see a lot of .NET Passport-enabled Web sites appearing as well. But if you can't stand the little app, there are a couple of ways to get rid of it, and ensure that it doesn't pop up every time you boot into XP. The best way simply utilizes the previous tip:
<br /><br />If you'd like Windows Messenger to show up in the list of programs you can add and remove from Windows, navigate to C:WINDOWSinf and open sysoc.inf (see the previous tip for more information about this file). You'll see a line that reads:
<br /><br />msmsgs=msgrocm.dll,OcEntry,msmsgs.inf,hide,7
<br /><br />Change this to the following and Windows Messenger will appear in Add or Remove Programs,
<br /><br />then Add/Remove Windows Components, then , and you can remove it for good:
<br /><br />msmsgs=msgrocm.dll,OcEntry,msmsgs.inf,7
<br /><br />Now you’ll be able to Remove Windows Messenger In Windows Xp.

<br /><br />You might be concerned about someone browsing your users? swap files and gathering up little bits of their sensitive data. A remote possibility, to be sure, but it could happen. For that extra measure of security,
<br /><br />go to:

<br /><br />Set the ClearPageFileAtShutdown DWORD to 1. This will make shutdowns take longer, because it overwrites everything in the swap file with zeroes. Don?t turn this feature on unless you have a serious security threat.

<br /><br />Just because Windows XP has the Add/Remove Programs feature it doesn't mean your application will appear in the list. Furthermore, even if it does appear, it's no guarantee that the uninstall feature will work. When you run across one of these situations the items listed below will help in getting rid of the application. Be aware that these steps may not remove everything associated with the application and can impact other applications on the computer. Have a backup or restore point and use caution.
<br /><br />Find the directory for the application and delete all the files in the directory. Delete the directory.
<br /><br />Open regedit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE and find the folder for the
<br /><br />application. Delete the folder.
<br /><br />Open regedit and navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USERSOFTWARE and find the folder for the application. Delete the folder.
