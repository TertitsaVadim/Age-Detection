How can a woman birth babies and be a full fledge JUNKIE,,get busted for &quot;Trafficking Drug's&quot; 3 time's and still collect $$$ from the State of Missouri..OMG...Eveb after all kind's of FACTS and Information was turnd in and farified..she still get's away with EVERYTHING.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />..and here I sit with two little kid's at this stage of my life.I want a MAN!!! I'm not done with being a woman just yet.But what Man in his right mind want's a woman like ME.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />..I'm not dead yet.I still have a lot of good in me that hasn't been brought out yet.I'll survive.And these kid's will grow up with a LIFE..not an exsistance filled with drug's and booze..Not while I still have anything to say about it.So I guess I'll just have to work a little harder and find more time hidden someplace in 24 hours.Heck..I found time to hit these key's tonite.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />..so I think I'm a WINNER in this battle after all.Just not ready to give up on Love..I miss a miss a Man by my side.This game ain't over YET!!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />
