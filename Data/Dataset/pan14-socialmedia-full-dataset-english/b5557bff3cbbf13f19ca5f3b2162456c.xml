On the popular American show &quot;Friends&quot; one of the characters (Ross) tries to impress a cute girl by attempting to play rugby. Sadly, Ross knew almost nothing about rugby and he ends up getting injured. The cute girl then has to tend to Ross while he is in the hospital.<br /><br />The history of rugby is usually a bit muddled, with different historians plus rugby clubs believing different versions belonging to the origination of rugby. Many historians believe that rugby and soccer came and developed down different paths all along. Others assume that rugby came from football. To them, William Webb Ellis started out rugby when he was a student at Rugby University in 1823. During a game of soccer, it is believed that he grabbed the ball and ran with it. Although this was against the rules at the moment, other players saw the appeal also and it became more common while in games. This tale is not really substantiated, but it is widely held to be true. In fact, the rugby world cup is called the &quot;William Webb Ellis Trophy.&quot;<br /><br />Not everyone was thrilled with this addition to football, and official it was voted against at the Freemason's Tavern, in London. This caused a division in teams who were for running with the ball and those that weren't. Two separate sports evolved with this meeting. I found that this website explained this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myentertainmentarticles.com%2F4538%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myentertainmentarticles.com/4538/</a> article.<br /><br />It wasn't until 1845 that rugby got its first number of rules. Three rugby clubs cooperated and created a set of rules that they would follow. Not all clubs chose to abide by these new regulations and rugby remained somewhat informal until 1870. The formality came with the Rugby Basketball Union which cleaned up the game a tad and cut out a few of the overly aggressive moves. A year later, the Rugby Football Union created the 59 Laws belonging to the Game. In 1871, Scottish rugby players stunted the English rugby players to somewhat of a match (with Scotland gradually winning). By 1880 other nations had established rules for rugby clubs.<br /><br />Rugby became a paying sport while in the 1890s. Though rugby players were not supposed to be paid, according to the rules belonging to the Rugby Football Union, one club was paying players who missed work to experience &quot;broken time&quot; wages. The particular club was suspended, including a meeting ensued which took twenty-two clubs to secede the Rugby Football Union. These people formed the Northern Partnership, which would eventually turn into the Rugby League. This new union adjusted the rules and quantity of players to draw more spectators, further separating the Rugby Football Union through the Rugby League.<br /><br />Rugby was first played in the US in 1874. The game was Harvard against McGill University. It remained well-liked in the united states until 1924, when it had been cut from the Olympics. Recently, it has started to turn popular once again (though it's popularity never really waned while in the European countries).

I found that this webpage showed this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myrealestatearticles.net%2F1065%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myrealestatearticles.net/1065/</a> weblog.<br /><br />If you are a runner then you should consider having 2 days off for every 5 days on, and build up your distance covered by an increase of 10% per week.<br /><br />Good quality running shoes are essential so old ones should be replaced with suitable shock absorbing shoes - ideally if you are running 20 miles + per week you should look to replace your shoes every 4 - 8 months.<br /><br />Stretching should also be carried out before and after running - this will help avoid tightness in the calf and hamstring.<br /><br />Stretching the calf muscles helps to reduce the area of concentrated force to your feet. It has been shown that you can reduce pressure at the heel and the ball of the foot by over half with simple stretching of the calf muscle. Other benefits to stretching include increased blood circulation to the foot<br /><br />Calf Stretch - The best stretch to the calf (achilles) is the wall stretch.<br /><br />You can also perform:<br /><br />Hamstring Stretch - To do this you need to straighten one leg with your knee locked in place on a foot stool. You then bend your body back and bring your head towards you leg.<br /><br />Foot Anatomy<br /><br />In order to understand how injuries to the foot can occur it is important to have a bit of knowledge of the anatomy of the foot.<br /><br />The foot essentially acts as the foundation to the whole body, they also act as shock absorbers and produce propulsion for the body.<br /><br />The foot and ankle contain:<br /><br />o	26 bones (One-quarter of the bones in the human body are in the feet.);<br />o	33 joints;<br />o	more than 100 muscles, tendons (fibrous tissues that connect muscles to bones), and ligaments (fibrous tissues that connect bones to other bones); and<br />o	a network of blood vessels, nerves, skin, and soft tissue.

One the most popular sport watch is the Garmin 305.<br /><br />With GPS receiver to monitor speed and distance, heart rate monitor and calorie tracker to monitor workout intensity and other features, Garmin 305 has become one of the best sport watches in the market.<br /><br />By following these steps, you can optimize the Garmin 305 so you can practice better and more effective. I found that this blog showed this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmortgageask.com%2F981%2Fjan-30-year-fixed-mortgage-rates-5-3-bernake-cutting-rates-theyre-6-1%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mortgageask.com/981/jan-30-year-fixed-mortgage-rates-5-3-bernake-cutting-rates-theyre-6-1/</a> website.<br /><br />Step 1 <br />You can monitor your progress in the Training Center By the time you buy a Garmin 305, you'll get a USB cable to integrate easily with the Training Center program installed on your computer. After exercise, connect the Garmin Forerunner 305 to your computer and then transfer your workout data to the computer. There, you will be able to see a graph that compares the heart rate, speed and distance that occur during exercise. With this feature, you can see weaknesses, such as hills or recovery areas, by overlaying the workout data onto maps of the course. You can use this data to plan your next workout so you can improve your performance.<br /><br />Step 2 <br />You can use the 12 data screens to get direct feedback during the workout. The data that you can see on the screen including calories burned, grade and direction, elevation, lap and pace modes, heart rate tracking and distance travelled. You can make adjustment up to three main data screens that are important to your workout. These data will be stored in internal memory that can later be transferred to the Training Center.<br /><br />Step 3 <br />Add foot pod accessory and heart rate monitor for extra performance data. Foot pod allows you to practice indoors to monitor distance, pace and calories burned. Connect Foot Pod to your sport shoe by tying shoe laces through the foot pod. Foot pod is on standby until you install or move it and see the LED light blink three times. After pairing the Foot Pod to the Garmin 305, Garmin 305 will automatically recognize the initiated foot pod. You can calibrate the foot pod to improve accuracy.<br /><br />Just as the Foot Pod, heart rate monitor is on standby, ready to send data to the Garmin 305. Put the heart rate monitor just below the breastbone with the Garmin logo right-side up. Set heart rate monitor to the Garmin 305 by selecting the heart rate function in the data screen. The Garmin 305 will automatically recognize the heart rate monitor after the initial.<br /><br />Step 4 <br />You can compete against virtual partner. Choose the Virtual Partner function to motivate you during the workout. For example, if your goal is running as far as 10 miles at a pace of 6:00 / mile, then you can adjust the Virtual Partner to a 6:00 / mile pace. During the workout, the 305 will monitor your performance as compared with the virtual partner and constantly remind you when you require to improve the pace.<br /><br />Warnings and Tips: <br />- Read the manual before operating. <br />- Consult a medical professional before commencing an exercise program.

This fusion of sports technology and designer fashion was immediately successful, and twenty years on it remains a popular formula. I found that this individual demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ftoastersreviews.com%2F538%2Fhosed%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://toastersreviews.com/538/hosed/</a> weblog.<br /><br />The range of Adidas Y3 trainers available today demonstrates clearly how important this collaboration is and how successful. Whether you're into men's fashion and designer clothing or you're in to footwear designed to enhance performance and provide real benefits to whichever sport you're into, Y3 has much to offer.<br /><br />For those who enjoy wearing fashion clothing the Y3 trainer offers a unique look that's immediately distinctive. Sporting the traditional three stripes which makes up the Adidas logo (which is where the '3' comes from in the Y3 brand, the 'Y' standing for 'Yamamoto') as well as a sleek, streamlined look and an enormous amount of attention to detail, they are one of the most sought after leisure wear items. But unusually these same trainers are much sought after by those at the top of their game in sporting activities as diverse as tennis and boxing, or running and martial arts.<br /><br />Each sport places a unique combination of demands on the feet, whether that be twisting, running, bouncing, cushioning, gripping or support to the leg. Having the right kind of footwear can be crucial, not just in helping to provide comfort and minimise damage or strain, but in offering real advantages. For example, if you think about a fairly simple and straightforward sport such as running, the right kind of trainer can offer two key benefits.<br /><br />As the heal strikes the ground on each stride an enormous force is generated and transferred from the foot all the way up the leg, passing through the ankle joint and the knee joint, as well as imparting a shock wave through the hips, up the back and even as far as the neck. This repetitive shock can cause damage to the joints, muscles and tendons, and so the right kind of footwear for runners offers a cushioning effect at the heal which helps to absorb some of the force, acting almost like a car's shock absorber.<br /><br />Dampening the force from the heal strike can make a huge difference, but that's not the only benefit which Adidas Y3 trainers for runners can offer. Another benefit offered is a springy, bouncy material applied to the front of the foot, around the ball of the foot. This very bouncy material acts like a sort of spring, so that as you push off with the ball of your foot the trainer actually helps enhance that push, literally putting a spring in your step which helps to maximise the power of each stride.<br /><br />This combination of materials and combination of benefits is unique to the needs of a runner, and the full range of Adidas Y3 trainers offer unique combinations of benefits like these across a whole range of different sports and sporting activities. Some sports such as boxing need a great deal of ankle support, and the ability to twist and turn lightly and easily on the ball of your foot. Other sports such as martial arts often require much more grip for stability. Whatever sport you're into, if you're looking for an advantage which will help maximise your performance as well as offering comfort and a look that's unmistakably modern and stylish then Adidas Y3 trainers are definitely work a look.

Remember, you need to vary your workouts to match the intensity of your other training. Cross-training is difficult but vital to your success. The main issue with sport-specific strength and fitness training at any level, but particularly when first starting to train, is overtraining. Overtraining can derail the whole effort. You can run into problems with connective tissue, illness, excess weight loss, and malaise...all related back to overtraining, simply doing too much, too soon, and not in the right balance.<br /><br />That being said, your goal must amazing, it must excite you...the hurdles are immense but not insurmountable, you simply must have a plan.<br /><br />The first part of any sport-specific strength and fitness program is the evaluation. You must have an honest, heart-to-heart with yourself and with your team to access where you are now and where you want to end up, relative to fitness. You also need to establish incremental goals along the way, as well as the ultimate goal. In other words, you need to know where you are and where you are going...where you want to end up! That being said, you must do it the proper manner, progressing in just the right way, and timing it all just so...so you peak at just the right moment.<br /><br />You are about to embark upon the journey of a lifetime and the program, the timing, and the overall coaching is crucial. One component ignored or mishandled will result in a less-that-desired effect. As in business and in life, planning and timing are everything. You are basically embarking upon a launch, a product launch, and you are the product...or will be!<br /><br />So, here's what you do:<br /><br />1) Physical assessment. Know exactly where you stand on a variety of tests, all sport-specific. Test and measure everything, just as in business!<br /><br />2) Have an honest discussion with your trainers after the testing to assess weakness and strengths.<br /><br />3) Develop a plan of attack, and here is the most important aspect, trust your coaches with your <br />development...completely! Even Michael Jordan has a coach. You must turn yourself over to your coach and if he says &quot;S*#t bagels in the parking lot!&quot; You say, &quot;How many and how big!&quot; He'll tell you for how long...until he says stop!<br /><br />4) Get started!<br /><br />5) Assess often but not too often, as that may be counter-productive. Some gains will come fast and others will need constant attention and prodding for you to get ultimate results.<br /><br />Now, how do you work out?<br /><br />Based on the tests, the assessment, the discussion, and keeping the ultimate goal in mind, the training should be varied and should follow an adaptable and forward-thinking plan.<br /><br />1) You need to vary eccentric and concentric (negative-based and positive-based) activities. The negative will allow you to get to muscle fibers and to a degree impossible with a concentric only or a concentric-based routine. But you must vary the attack, one day concentric, two days later eccentric. And so on! Too much of one or the other will lead to minimal gains, no gains or, worse possible scenario...you will go backwards and lose strength and muscle, finally getting sick.<br /><br />Balance in sport-specific training is everything!<br /><br />2) You must have a cross-training, anaerobic/aerobic fitness approach...always pushing the boundaries of what is anaerobic and what is aerobic. As your fitness level increases and improves you will find what was once anaerobic is not aerobic...then you push again!<br /><br />Always push the boundaries!<br /><br />3) The balance between circuit training and conventional weight training is crucial. You need to push the aerobic/anaerobic envelope by increasing the intensity of the circuit, while balancing weights and machines.<br /><br />Once again, the proper balance is everything!<br /><br />Penn State, many years ago (late 70s and early 80s) had an awesome football program, in large measure because of Papa Joe Paterno...but also because of their strength and fitness program. However, as with human beings everywhere, they were looking for 'something better!&quot; Enter Nautilus! Penn State changed over their entire system to accommodate this new fitness machine, all the rage at the time. They almost completely eliminated the free-weight, power aspect of their training in favor of Arthur Jones's new claims that a 30 minute workout was all anyone needed...that...<br /><br />&quot;To do more was like tenderizing hamburger!&quot;<br /><br />Well, Penn State and Papa Joe bit and changed their program. In one year their program tanked! Joe Paterno is no dumby, and he certainly didn't have to be hit over the head to know he'd been wrong, the next year the reintegrated the weights and two years late they were national champions!<br /><br />Enough said!<br /><br />The balance was everything, that and working out in a sport-specific manner.<br /><br />You see, it is not just &quot;muscle-heads&quot; in the gym pumping up for a Friday night date, what I used to call the PPP or pre-party pump. You can't train like a bodybuilder preparing for a bodybuilding contest or powerlifter preparing for a powerlifting competition.<br /><br />The workouts I use for my clients, the ones Penn State uses, and used back them, are sport-specific...in this case football-specific in nature.<br /><br />The right ratio of machine to free weight workout is essential. Significantly, it is also very important which machines are used and which free weight exercises are applied to your sport-specific strength and fitness program.<br /><br />I tell my students, particularly the football athletes I train, because they all thought you just &quot;had&quot; to bench, just like you may believe a certain nutritional supplement is the best, that the first time they put a bench on the 50-yard line I would let them bench. Of course, I used the same analogy for every athlete, in every sport I trained.<br /><br />The message is the same, sport-specific exercises, integrating the proper motions and/or movements is of greater significance than how much one can bench.<br /><br />Interestingly, we have all been taught that you exercise in a certain way, and that certain exercises should be integrated into any workout program. That sort of thinking is, quite simply, wrong!<br /><br />Additionally, machines in and of themselves are just as bad. Again, there must be a balance between machines and free weights in any exercise program.<br /><br />Now, make sure that at least one day a week your exercise program, at least the sport-specific weight training portion is a negative or eccentric workout. The eccentric or negative workout should be a high intensity, heavy, free weight workout.<br /><br />Additionally, one workout should be what I refer to as a &quot;coning&quot; workout, meaning that you work from the heavy to light and finally to complete failure.<br /><br />A third workout, and each one of these workouts should be a same body part workout, should be a &quot;pyramid&quot; workout, and should go from light to heavy.<br /><br />The same body part or combination of body parts are worked 3 times a week.<br /><br />As in:<br /><br />Monday morning: Upper body &quot;coning to failure&quot; (chest, shoulders, triceps, abs, calves, forearms)<br />Monday late afternoon: Upper body &quot;coning to failure&quot; (back and biceps, abs, calves, forearms)<br /><br />Tuesday morning: Legs &quot;coning to failure&quot; (Quads, glutes, abductors and adductors, calves, abs, forearms)<br />Tuesday late afternoon: Legs &quot;coning to failure&quot; (Hamstrings*, calves, abs, forearms)<br /><br />Wednesday morning: Monday morning body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br />Wednesday late afternoon: Monday late afternoon body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br /><br />Thursday morning: Tuesday morning body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br />Thursday later afternoon: Tuesday late afternoon body parts &quot;pyramiding to failure&quot;<br /><br />Friday morning: Monday morning body parts &quot;negative&quot;<br />Friday late afternoon: Monday late afternoon body parts &quot;negative&quot;<br /><br />Saturday morning: Total leg blowout! &quot;negative&quot;<br /><br />Sunday: The Day of Rest from all things!<br /> I found that this blogger described this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskingaboutloans.com%2F1081%2Ffind-unsecured-business-loan-people-bad-credit-uk-staring-business%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askingaboutloans.com/1081/find-unsecured-business-loan-people-bad-credit-uk-staring-business/</a> article.<br />*Hamstrings, leg biceps or biceps femoris, are the muscles at the back of the leg. Significantly, as you may already be aware, it is one of the most neglected muscles in the body. The proper strength ratio, quadraceps to hamstrings, can make a huge difference in your success as an athlete and also may play a big role in whether or not you have a hamstring injury at some point in your training. The hamstrings are also a key component in power and quickness...and well as in explosiveness (related to power) and speed!<br /><br />Every workout, you need to do abdominal work, lower back exercises, obliques, calves, and forearms (alternating exercises and intensity)<br /><br />Every morning your need to be doing very specific neck exercises, most being exercises your trainer can with you with a towel and their hands! Nothing is ever needed beyond that, at least in the early stages, as your neck just isn't that strong...but needs to be!<br /><br />As Woody Hayes once told me, &quot;As the neck goes, so goes the body! Work the neck constantly!&quot;<br /><br />There are a number of exercises I use with my clients that would help but the key is to use the right balance! Additionally, dumbbells OVER barbells, and machines in concert with free weights is key. The free weights offer real world, synergistic benefits machines alone cannot. Dumbbells and single-side exercises are more effective than barbell exercises for sport-specific training...and for competitive results.<br /><br />I have trained athletes at every level, I know this program works, I hope you will incorporate my ideas if you are in need of an edge, they will help you achieve your goals. If not, I still wish you every good thing, and a place on the team to boot!

For those lucky enough to be able to afford waterfront property, this is an opportunity that should not be missed. Even the more affordable houses with views over this magnificent body of water should not be overlooked, as Lake Washington offers those who live near it aspects of beauty you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.<br /><br />The second largest lake in the state after Lake Chelan, Lake Washington has availability for housing developments along its entire shoreline. Because of its long, skinny shape, the shoreline is considerable and is still open for more building opportunities. Save for the areas that are parks, marinas or airports, the rest of the shores are dedicated to homeowners, and giving those people some of the most incredible opportunities around. The waters of this lake are fresh and blue, and are extremely clean after extreme measure were taken to improve the water quality in the 60's. I found that this weblog demonstrated this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Froadbikesreviewed.com%2Fbadly-job-accountant-toronto-october%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://roadbikesreviewed.com/badly-job-accountant-toronto-october/</a>  blog post.<br /><br />Houses built along Lake Washington are built to take in the view. Sweeping windows are common, along with sloping lawns to take advantage of the shoreline. Most houses have docks with the capability to house 1-3 boats, and a smaller percentage of them have covered boat houses. Even those that don't have docks often take advantage of the required buoys just off the shore, and can tie boats off there. Waterfront condos are less common than waterfront houses along Lake Washington, but condos are often built on the hills that rise away from the water, meaning that every floor can enjoy a waterfront view. Great snowy Mount Rainier can be seen from just about anywhere on Lake Washington, as it rises over the southern section of the lake on clear days. Because of the north-south orientation of the lake, and how skinny it is, the vast majority of houses face either due east or due west, which makes for some of the most stunning sunset or sunrise views of the whole state. There is nothing quite like enjoying your morning cup of coffee while the sun rising golden over the forests on the other side, and turning light to liquid fire as it touches the water.<br /><br />Lake Washington is home to an abundance of wildlife. The waters are teeming with fish that are available to fish (when in season) that include salmon, bass, perch, carp, longfin smelt and even sturgeon. Mallard ducks and Canadian geese are common sights over the water, while bald eagles herons make the occasional appearance as well. River otters are a treat, as there is nothing more adorable than two sleek otters play-wrestling in your yard.<br /><br />Living lakeside is an opportunity that should not be passed up. It is the ultimate luxury, and provides a stunning setting to raise a family among nature. With the endless summer entertainment it provides along with an epic seasonal backdrop, Lake Washington is arguably one of the greatest places to live in the world.

Who will take another Academy Award home as winner and who will just spend the night applauding others? As no one knows for sure yet, let's take a look at the list of the Best Picture Nominees and try to come up with some system to make predictions.<br /><br />Best Picture Nominees for the 83rd Academy Awards:<br /><br />Black Swan -- director: Darren Aronofsky; writers: Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz; stars: Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel;<br /><br />The Fighter -- director: David O. Russell; writers: Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Stars: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale and Amy Adams<br /><br />Inception -- Director: Christopher Nolan; Writer: Christopher Nolan; Stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ellen Page<br /><br />The Kids Are All Right -- director: Lisa Cholodenko; writers: Lisa Cholodenko, Stuart Blumberg; stars: Annette Bening, Julianne Moore vand Mark Ruffalo<br /><br />The King's Speech -- director: Tom Hooper; writer: David Seidler; stars: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter<br /><br />127 Hours -- director: Danny Boyle; writers: Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy, stars: James Franco, Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara<br /><br />The Social Network -- director: David Fincher; writers: Aaron Sorkin, Ben Mezrich; stars: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake<br /><br />Toy Story 3 -- director: Lee Unkrich; writers: John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, stars: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack<br /><br />True Grit -- directors: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen; writers: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen; stars: Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld<br /><br />Winter's Bone -- director: Debra Granik; writers: Debra Granik, Anne Rosellini, stars: Jennifer Lawrence, John Hawkes and Garret Dillahunt<br /><br />Hm, now that's a list of some pretty good movies, how are these guys in Academy Awards supposed to decide, who is better? Whom they should give the Oscar statue? Oh the tension... Maybe we can help out by comparing them -- how they were created, how they did in theaters and awards? Maybe we can develop some kind of system for determining the most likely winners...<br /><br />You can see that most of them have really big names in cast and crew. Thought celebrity pressure can come from any of these movies; it's not clear how to evaluate one or another star's influence for popularity of the movie. Also, one should not forget that we all have our favorites, which is not good for making objective predictions. So we have to take some other, measurable and comparable things into account when deciding.<br /><br />First thing we could look at is a) how much was invested in creating these movies <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> how much they earned from them. In short -- were they successful and the effort worth the money?<br /><br />List no. 1: 'Budget size vs. success'<br />Black Swan -- budget: 13,000,000; earnings: 83,250,375; ROI: 5.4<br />The Kids Are All Right -- budget: 4,000,000; earnings: 20,803,237; ROI: 4.2<br />The King's Speech -- budget: 15,000,000; earnings: 57,313,881; ROI: 2.8<br />True Grit -- budget: 38,000,000; earnings: 137,963,519; ROI: 2.6<br />Winter's Bone -- budget: 2,000,000; earnings: 6,271,086; ROI: 2.1<br />The Fighter -- budget: 25,000,000; earnings: 72,680,740; ROI: 1.9<br />The Social Network -- budget: 40,000,000; earnings: 95,408,473; ROI: 1.4<br />Toy Story 3 -- budget: 200,000,000; earnings: 415,004,880; ROI: 1.1<br />Inception -- budget: 160,000,000; earnings: 292,568,851; ROI: 0.8<br />127 Hours -- budget: 18,000,000; earnings: 11,296,805; ROI: -0.4<br /><br />What we get here is a very simple list of the Best Picture nominees according to return on investment [ROI] made in making them. The biggest return taking the first place, when going down to the smallest in the bottom. Basically, it shows how much money oscar nominees made in US from premier till January, divided by their estimated budget ($ numbers from IMDB and boxofficemojo.com). Conclusion - big budget is not everything you need for a blockbuster - &quot;Black Swan&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; budgets were more than 10 times smaller compared to Inception, but they managed to make around 4 - 5 times more from one dollar invested. The biggest loser so far &quot;127 Hours&quot;, which haven't managed to earn enough to cover costs yet. I didn't rank them according to gross earnings, as popular opinion and sales can easily be manipulated by increasing spending on advertising, ROI shows a lot more in this case.<br /><br />Secondly, we could consider how have these movies done in professional competitions?<br /><br />List no. 2: 'What do the pros think?&quot;<br />The Social Network -- nominations: 55; Wins: 49; Oscar nom.:8; Total: 112 <br />The King's Speech -- nominations: 73; Wins: 16; Oscar nom.: 12; Total: 101 <br />Black Swan -- nominations: 71; Wins: 21; Oscar nom.: 5; Total: 97 <br />Inception -- nominations: 57; Wins: 27; Oscar nom.: 8; Total: 92 <br />True Grit -- nominations: 55; Wins: 12; Oscar nom.: 10; Total: 77 <br />127 Hours -- nominations: 55; Wins: 4; Oscar nom.: 6; Total: 65 <br />Winter's Bone -- nominations: 42; Wins: 19; Oscar nom.: 4; Total: 65 <br />The Fighter -- nominations: 32; Wins: 23; Oscar nom.: 7; Total: 62 <br />The Kids Are All Right -- nominations: 51; Wins: 3; Oscar nom.: 4; Total: 58 <br />Toy Story 3 -- nominations: 18; Wins: 18; Oscar nom.: 5; Total: 41<br /><br />Here I added up all nominations with wins to see which movies were noticed the most in different awards. Here &quot;The Social Network&quot; takes lead, with &quot;The King's Speech&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot; still in top three before the big spenders &quot;Inception&quot; and others. Hmm do we see a trend here already?<br /><br />Thirdly, it's very important to compare how viewers and critics evaluate these movies:<br /><br />List no. 3: 'A, B, C... or F?'<br />Toy Story 3 -- IMDB: 8.7; metacritics.com: 92; average: 9.0 <br />The Social Network -- IMDB: 8.2; metacritics.com: 95; average: 8.9 <br />The King's Speech -- IMDB: 8.5; metacritics.com: 88; average: 8.7<br />Winter's Bone -- IMDB: 7.5; metacritics.com: 90; average: 8.3 <br />Black Swan -- IMDB: 8.6; metacritics.com: 79; average: 8.3 <br />127 Hours -- IMDB: 8.2; metacritics.com: 82; average: 8.2 <br />Inception -- IMDB: 9.0; metacritics.com: 74; average: 8.2 <br />True Grit -- IMDB: 8.2; metacritics.com: 80; average: 8.1 <br />The Fighter -- IMDB: 8.2; metacritics.com: 79; average: 8.1 <br />The Kids Are All Right -- IMDB: 7.4; metacritics.com: 86; average: 8.0<br /><br />I ranked these movies according to IMDB and metacritic.com rankings average. &quot;Toy story 3&quot; does very well here, by both viewers in IMDB and critics in metacritic.com. Some of the previous leaders spatter across the list giving an interesting perspective for possible Oscar evening winners.<br /><br />And finally, to get the result we need to sum up all previous scores - from 1 to 10, the smallest score being the best: I found that this site described this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fpromealreplacementshakes.com%2F3240%2Fbodybuilder-vegan%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://promealreplacementshakes.com/3240/bodybuilder-vegan/</a>  post.<br /><br />List no. 4: 'The Grande Finale'<br />The King's Speech 8 <br />Black Swan 9 <br />The Social Network 10 <br />Winter's Bone 16 <br />True Grit 17 <br />Toy Story 3 19 <br />Inception 20 <br />The Kids Are All Right 21 <br />127 Hours 22 <br />The Fighter 23<br /><br />So here you go! Top 3 most possible Oscar winners according to our little calculation are: leader &quot;The King's Speech&quot;, followed by &quot;Black Swan&quot; and &quot;The Social Network&quot;. I guess this not a big surprise as &quot;The King's Speech&quot; already boast 16 wins in such awards as Golden Globes, British Independent Films and others. Let's not forget 12 Oscar nominations, which is a great accomplishment by itself.

This is such a great birthday theme because there are so many things you can do to liven up your party. Stumped as to where to start? Here are some great ideas to help you throw a super dog themed birthday party.<br /><br />You never get a second chance to make a first impression so make sure your first impression is a good one! Your invitation is the first thing people will see and can set the whole tone for your party. Choose from ready-made invitations or go online to auction sites that print personalized invitations for you. I found that this blog demonstrated this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbikereviewshack.com%2F440%2Fmountain-bikes-buy%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bikereviewshack.com/440/mountain-bikes-buy/</a>  blog post.<br /><br />Decorate your space using the dog birthday party supplies. They come in lime green and blue and really feature some cute dogs on them! Make sure you get some paw print balloons and dog bone shaped cups too. These cups can also make a great party favor to give your guests. The parents will thank you for not sending home their child with a bag of candy and useless toys and your party guests will definitely appreciate all the trouble you went to!<br /><br />Keep your birthday party menu simple and stick with foods that you know will appeal to most kids. Chips, hot dogs and pretzels are good staples. But, just in case you may want to keep a bag of chicken nuggets handy for that friend who is a picky eater. You could also serve up some popcorn or other easy snack. Serve drinks in covered cups to avoid cleanup later.<br /><br />Show a dog themed movie at your party to serve as intermission between your birthday activities. During the movie you can serve up some delicious treats like dog bone cookies or even some microwave popcorn. Remember to keep your party finish time in mind before you start the movie and pick a movie that isn't too long. After all, nothing makes a kid crankier than stopping a movie just when it was getting good.<br /><br />As for the birthday cake you may find that cupcakes are easier. Decorate your cupcakes with puppy faces, dog bones or dog houses. If you do decide to bake a traditional birthday cake, do something different. Make a dog bowl cake and use breakfast cereal for the kibble. Use your imagination, it is your best tool!

Another year has gone by and your child wants a birthday party... again. If you are like us, we've had a party for our kids every year. At first it was more of a get together of our friends because our boys were too young to even know what was happening. Then it became our friends that had children, but now our kids are old enough to have their own friends and we have to plan the event... Panic!<br /><br />We have 2 kids, and we have learned through the years and parties, by trial and error, how to do it pretty well. Not to mention that owning a gymnastics and fitness program that offers gymnastics birthday parties in Madison lets us have a little more experience than the average parent.<br /><br />Birthdays and party planning have evolved. Back in the 1950's mothers would get flour and sugar and make a cake and the party was held at home. In the 1970's moms bought a box mix and the party was still held at home. In the 1990's parties moved to destinations, zoos, pools, and parks and such became frequent choices for mom to take the birthday party to. Nowadays, moms are looking for an experience for the birthday party. That is part of why a party service is so popular. This is the current trend and of course I am grateful, but that doesn't mean you can't go it alone. Whether you choose to handle it at home, or have a gymnastics birthday party; I will try to help.<br /><br />I have learned that having your child's birthday party seems complicated but is actually pretty easy. If you are the type of parent who would use a service then your stress level drops infinitesimally. But if, like my mom, you do it all yourself, then you might need a little guidance. Planning a party is all about the details and keeping in mind that kids just want to have fun. Unfortunately, much of the planning is often based around the adults attending, or trying to please the parents of the children at the party. This is a lot of unnecessary stress. Stay focused on the kids.<br /><br />Let's start from the beginning. Whether using a service or flying solo, start planning at least a month in advance. You won't believe how many people call us on Friday for a Saturday Party. You should really give your guests a little heads up to plan for the date or buy a gift online if they would like to, (though I usually stop at a store on the way to a party that my sons are going to. Shh, don't tell). You will also need time to get your decorations, order a cake and recruit friends to help on the day of the event.<br /><br />Pick your theme, if you want one. You should have a theme; it will help unify the party and can help in planning activities. Sometimes it's as easy as just incorporating a few of your child's favorite things: Princesses, fairy tales, or in my family's case, legos and dragons. Use your theme to plan decorations, games, cake decorations, and even the invitations. Putting your theme into the invite allows guests to go for a gift that will fit the theme. I have also seen parties that ask for toys to donate, books to share, or coats to donate in the winter. I love these themes and they incorporate a good lesson for a child that parallels the celebration.<br /><br />Detail reminder: Kids will remember the fun they had more than the spotless house you have. They will remember the games over the color of plates and paper goods, if themes are sweatin' you it's ok to go generic.<br /><br />Now, when should we have this party? If the children at the party will be older than the age that needs naps then between 1 and 4 are the best times, parties should last about 2 hours unless you're doing several activities and planning a whole day. If that is the case remember to budget the psychotherapy for yourself the day after. If the party is for younger children (nappers) then between 10 and noon is best. This feeds right into their afternoon nap and their own mom and dad will thank you. For parties on weekends, remember that many families have church obligations and Sunday AMs might conflict.<br /><br />How many and who to invite: I have heard a formula that states your child's age plus one is the number of guests you should invite. I have also seen many parents invite whole classes, up to 25+ kids. The right answer is, invite how many you can handle. If you are using an outside facility then you pay more for more kids. Consider your budget. Also consider your chaos tolerance. If you can handle the chaos that having many kids will bring then &quot;Party On!&quot; If you like a little more control, than limit your invites. Remember that it's your child's party and don't feel pressured to add in siblings of friends and/or kids your child only sort of knows. Parties are more fun when everyone is already friends before the party starts. Many schools have a policy that if you invite one in school that you should invite everyone. Ask your child's teacher for contact e mails for the families you want to invite, or try to get phone numbers. Do a little pre-invitation inviting and ask parents if they would be interested. Tell them why you are contacting them out of school.<br /><br />The dilemma of the goodie bag. It has been a trend that parents feel obligated to provide some toys/candy/ meaningless stuff soon to be found in the trash to each guest as a thank you for coming. It was originally intended to satisfy the children attending that gave gifts and felt ripped off because they didn't get anything back. (Can you feel my position on goodie bags before I come right out and say it<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> I suggest downplaying the gifts in the first place, but it is traditional, so if gifts are a part of the plan, then maybe coming up with other activities immediately following the opening of gifts will alleviate the jealousy that kids naturally feel when the birthday child opens gifts and immediately starts playing with them. Setting boundaries for your child beforehand works wonders, explain that they will have the toys after everyone goes home and can play then, and the party is the time to play with friends. Then be sure to have things to do. If you decide to do goodie bags, consider that each child should get different colors of similar toys; this avoids ownership disputes but also alleviates kids feeling that they want what someone else has. As a health-minded professional may I suggest leaving the candy out? It's not novel, it's not healthy and they don't need it. As I mentioned earlier, kids will remember what fun they had, not what they take home in a little bag. The best idea I've seen, other than no goodie bag, is to take home something they made at the party. Two birds-one stone: activity for the party and instant goodie bag.<br /><br />Games or activities: This is simple; make sure that everyone gets a chance to win. Play cooperative games where if some get's &quot;out&quot; or loses that it's temporary and that they can work their way back in. Think &quot;Duck, Duck, Goose&quot; like games, where someone might be out, or in this case in the center, but then they come back to the circle. Stay away from games like &quot;Musical Chairs&quot; where at the end one child wins and everyone else is sidelined and bored. Google &quot;cooperative games&quot; or even &quot;everyone wins games&quot; online for ideas. I found that this webpage demonstrated this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskdatingexperts.com%2F2292%2Fsong-love-games-season-2-punch-drunk-natalie-kissing-taylor%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askdatingexperts.com/2292/song-love-games-season-2-punch-drunk-natalie-kissing-taylor/</a>  web post.<br /><br />If you have boxed games or activities be sure that you have them out and ready to play so if they want to do that game, they don't have to wait while you look for it in the game closet. Being prepared is 90% of the success of a party.<br /><br />If you wish to use a service like a gymnastics, pool, playground or other type of party check out things other than price. What activities will the children do? For how long? And most importantly, who will be supervising them? Many of the local bounce houses employ peppy little teens who have no sense of responsibility and are easily distracted by shiny objects like cell phones. Be sure your party leader is having fun with your party, pays attention to the children and takes it seriously. They are, after all, the temporary host of the party; can you trust them to make it great? Using a birthday party service like a gym or a pool can be great, but be cautious. Make sure they actually have party program and aren't just doing it on whim to make quick cash. Being in that industry, I have seen many programs, local and outside this area, that add birthday parties for kids to their service intending for the easy income but not realizing or not caring about the importance of the party to the family and especially the birthday child. Talk to your friends and neighbors, what have they heard? Check reviews online. An hour of research can prevent many hours of disappointment with the wrong place.<br /><br />Lastly, at some point during the day; and it can be well after the guests have gone home, take a moment to forget the stress and chaos. Look into your child's face and remember why this day is important in the first place. Whether their 3, 7, 16 or 21 years old; this is their day, appreciate that for them. Give them a little hug and tell them that dispite what they just put you through, you still love them.

The Loop is a 600km circuit that starts and finishes in Chiang Mai taking you through the Mae Hong Son province via Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son town and Pai. Its the best route to take to cover the province and recommended for nature lovers, trekkers, motorcyclists, off-road adventures and in those wanting to delve deeper into Northern Thailand to experience a traditional and authentic area.<br /><br />The legs for the loop and driving distances are as follows:<br /><br />Chiang Mai - Pai 128km <br />&lt;br&gt;Pai - Mae Hong Son 109km <br />&lt;br&gt;Mae Hong Son -Mae Sariang 164km <br />&lt;br&gt;Mae Sai - Chiang Mai 190km<br /><br />The route above assumes doing the loop in an anti-clockwise direction, but it can also be done the opposite way stopping at Mae Sariang first. Overnight stops are recommended at each of the major towns (Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son, Pai) and from here you can take a 1 day or more excursion before continuing back on the loop. There are numerous tour operators in each of the towns offering a variety of sights and activities such as visits to hilltribe villages, white water rafting, elephant riding, waterfalls and trekking. Being more remote and less touristic the area is known to have more authentic treks than the ones offered in Chiang Mai and so is popular amongst real trekking enthusiasts. I found that this weblog demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NlbGxwaG9uZXJldmlld3Nwb3QuY29tL2JsYWNrYmVycnktYm9sZC12b2RhZm9uZS1wbGFuLXN3aXRjaC1uZXR3b3JrLWJvbGQv" target="_blank">Robbin Klingman</a> post.<br /><br />The loop needs a minimum of 4 days to cover but you could easily spend a week taking your time to explore villages and remote areas off the main route. On the last part of the loop from Mae Sariang to Chiang Mai you can even take the slightly scenic route via Doi Inthanon Mountain and National Park, the highest point in Thailand.<br /><br />The loop can be done by bus with several buses departing daily from each of the towns. Otherwise hiring a car or motorbike are other options, which would also be needed to explore the outlying areas unless you sign up for a tour.<br /><br />If driving yourself make sure you feel comfortable driving mountainous roads with steep uphill and down hairpin turns. For an extra 500bt a day you can &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thailandhilltribeholidays.com%2FThailand-Tour-Guide.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thailandhilltribeholidays.com/Thailand-Tour-Guide.html</a>]hire a driver[/url] <br />&lt;br&gt;to let you sit back and enjoy the scenery along the way. For an extra 800bt a day you can enjoy the services of a guide to explain to you exactly what you are seeing along the way and offer invaluable local information.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Facts about Mae Hong Son&lt;/u&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;-	Is the most mountainous and forested province in Thailand<br />&lt;br&gt;-	Is the least densely populated province in Thailand<br />&lt;br&gt;-	Is called the 'Land of 3 mists' due to the year round mist - mist from forest fires in the summer, a dewy mist in rainy season and foggy mist in the winter<br />&lt;br&gt;-	Was once known as the 'Siberia of Thailand' due to its isolated location<br />&lt;br&gt;-	Historically elephants were sent to be trained here where the rugged terrain is an ideal condition for this

There are specific colored lights on a PS3 including red, green and yellow. Each light and its prescribed blinking status and the particular model can indicate different issues with the Playstation 3. Sounds confusing doesn't it? You have to wonder if the lights and their meanings are not meant to be a deterrent to fixing your PS3 at home.<br /><br />The PS3 blinking red light generally indicates a heat issue. Inside of the unit is getting too hot and as a safety measure, the unit will shut off and begin flashing a red light. Of course, a red blinking light can also be a weak connection inside the system, which occurs because heat has melted the solder holding them in place.<br /><br />You have two choices at this point, you can send your game system to Sony for repairs, and pay the extra charges, if you are outside the warranty or you can attempt to fix the unit yourself. Many people prefer to try the latter because either they cannot afford the Sony tech charges or they are not sure that they will receive their system back. This is especially true for owners of the very few models that were backwards compatible with the PS2. If you have one of these game systems, you are unlucky indeed, as they are no longer making them compatible. I found that this web page explained this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2luc3VyYW5jZWFza2luZy5jb20vNjA2L2ZyZWUtYXV0by1pbnN1cmFuY2UtcXVvdGVzLXdlYnNpdGUv" target="_blank">Ruben Lazzari</a> weblog.<br /><br />If you think, you are incapable of working on and fixing your PS3 blinking red light problem you should know that a middle-aged mom with little technical ability fixed her game system in just a few hours. This is not rocket science my friend, but it does require a little practical understanding.

After all, how can you really go wrong with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in a western? But it turns out I was wrong. It wasn't good. It was brilliant!<br /><br />In fact, it is one of the best movies I have seen in years -- I'd say it's the best movie I have been to see since Master &amp;amp; Commander, another Russell Crowe movie that I dearly loved. Russell Crowe is just excellent as outlaw Ben Wade, providing him with charisma, menace and charm. Christian Bale, of course, is his usual incredible, intense self and they both have that crackling sparkly energy that Crowe had with Guy Pearce in L.A. Confidential. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent, especially Ben Foster playing Wade's second in command, Charlie Prince. Foster virtually steals every scene he's in. I found that this website showed this nicely on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jlc3R3aXJlbGVzc3N1cnJvdW5kc291bmRzeXN0ZW0uY29tLzM1OS83LTEtc3Vycm91bmQtc291bmQtc3lzdGVtLWhhcHBlbi1tb3ZpZS01LTEv" target="_blank">Leigh Lebish</a> website.<br /><br />Russell Crowe needs to play the charming, menacing bad guy a lot more often because he is perfect -- especially since they have him dashingly dressed almost entirely in black with black leather gloves, a jaunty cap, perfect facial hair, perfect smirk, a black horse even!  The second time I went to see the movie, I paid more attention to the visuals just to see how they present Ben Wade and it turns out I was correct in my previous recollection -- he is the only character dressed entirely in black in the entire movie. Visually, it makes him stand out significantly because both the scenery and the clothing worn by other characters are drab and neutral in color and tone.<br /><br />One of the other great things about this movie is that it is serious, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. There's lots of great one liners and really satisfyingly vicious murders. Midway through the movie, the pacing can be a bit slow here and there, but overall the film proceeds with a deft elegance.  There aren't a lot of westerns I find myself able to watch over and over again, but 3:10 to Yuma is going on my &quot;buy&quot; list as soon as it hits DVD.

They love to see stylish and cute looking cars speeding over the race tracks. Children, especially boys, are fascinated with race cars and their drivers. Race car drivers are often idolised by the kids. So, how about gifting them a race car on their birthday? No, we are not talking about the real race cars here. These are the small race cars, like electronic toys. The small toy cars are miniature versions of big cars. There are bigger versions of race cars too. Children can actually sit in those cars and drive them too. There is a wide variety of race cars available in the market. These are good looking and safe for kids <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyZWFkbWlsbGV2b2x1dGlvbi5jb20vMjEvZGlmZmVyZW5jZS10cmVhZG1pbGwtcnVubmluZy8_" target="_blank">reputation</a>.<br /><br />The race cars are available in varieties of materials, shapes and sizes. The features of the car decide its cost. If you go in a toy shop, you will find a variety of race cars. These are generally the 'pull back and release' cars. The advanced version of the toy race cars is the remote controlled one. The sensor in these cars is operated with a remote. The race cars run according to the remote command. Some of the more advanced versions operate on voice command. Kids can store their voice pattern in the cars. Later on, the car runs on similar voice command.<br /><br />The larger 'sit-in' versions of race cars are truly unique. You can see such cars at Kart racing. These race cars, also known as go- karts are provided with 2 or 4 stroke engines. The engine generates power of about 4 to 7 hp. The engines can be anything between 100 cc, 125 cc and 250 cc. The larger capacity engines are generally not put in the cars for kids below 15 years. You can choose the engine capacity as per the kid's age. The engines transmit power to the rear wheels. Such cars are available in a variety of models. Some of the cars possess the chassis like a motocross race car. The body is made up of iron rods or fibre. Whatever may be the type, kid's safety is the first priority in these cars.<br /><br />There are institutes which offer professional race car learning courses for the kids. Kids can enrol their names into the institute and learn how to drive a car. Kids are given safety helmets before sitting in the car. Seat belts are also provided. They are taught how to shift gears and accelerate the cars. Kids soon get to know about how to control the steering wheel. These cars normally produce low power. The gear box is provided without clutch. Brakes are hydraulic. The race cars are petrol driven. Some of the cars may require electric energy.<br /><br />If you don't want to give as a present a car that has an engine, then you can always gift a paddled race car. The pedals are fit inside the car body. A kid sits inside and drives the car by peddling it like a bicycle. This is rather the safest race car.
