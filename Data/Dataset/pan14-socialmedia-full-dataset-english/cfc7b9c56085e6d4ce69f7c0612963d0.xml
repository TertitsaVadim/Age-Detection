<br />When you open it, he collapses.
<br />When he sees you reading it, he faints.
<br />When he sees you living it, he flees.
<br />And just when you're about to re-post this, he will try and discourage you.
<br />I just defeated him, so can u.

<br /> teenage girl about 17yrs, had gone to visit
<br /> some friends one evening and time passed
<br /> quickly as each shared their various
<br /> experiences of
<br /> the past year. She ended up staying longer
<br /> than planned, and had to walk home alone.
<br /> She wasn’t afraid because it was a small town
<br /> and she lived only a few blocks away. As she
<br /> walked along under the tall elm trees, Diane
<br /> asked God to keep her safe ...from harm and
<br /> danger. When she reached the alley, which
<br /> was a short cut to her house, she decided to
<br /> take it. However, halfway down the alley she
<br /> noticed a man standing at the end as though
<br /> he was waiting for her. She became uneasy
<br /> and began to pray, asking for God’s
<br /> protection. Instantly a comforting feeling of
<br /> quietness and security wrapped round her,
<br /> she felt as though someone was walking
<br /> with her. When she reached the end of the
<br /> alley, she walked right past the man and
<br /> arrived home safely. The following day, she
<br /> read in the newspaper that a young girl had
<br /> been raped in the same alley just twenty
<br /> minutes after she had been there. Feeling
<br /> overwhelmed by this tragedy and the fact
<br /> that it could have been her, she began to
<br /> weep. Thanking the Lord for her safety and
<br /> to help this young woman, she decided to go
<br /> to the police station. She felt she could
<br /> recognize the man, so she told them her
<br /> story. The police asked her if she would be
<br /> willing to look at a lineup to see if she could
<br /> identify him. She agreed and immediately
<br /> pointed out the man she had seen in the alley
<br />the night before. When the man was told he
<br /> had been identified, he immediately broke
<br /> down and confessed. The officer thanked
<br /> Diane for her bravery and asked if there was
<br /> anything they could do for her. She asked if
<br /> they would ask the man one question. Diane
<br /> was curious as to why he had not attacked
<br /> her. When the policeman asked him, he
<br /> answered, “Because she wasn’t alone. She
<br /> had two tall men walking on either side of
<br /> her.” Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br /> you’re never alone. Did you know that 98%
<br /> of teenagers will not stand up for God?
<br /> Repost this as Love vs. Sex if you truly
<br /> believe in God. PS: God is always there in
<br /> your heart and loves you no matter what and if you stand up for him he will stand up for you. I bet 93% of the people that read this wont repost it. I read this and reposted it. Well I bet you read this note because of the title, didn’t you. *GOD IS MOVING!* <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> *Share it to evtaying longer than planned, and had to walk home alone.

<br />&quot;I don't understand,&quot; he said. His Mom just hugged him and said, &quot;And you never will.&quot;
<br />Later the little boy asked his father, &quot;Why
<br />does mother seem to cry for no reason?&quot;
<br />&quot;All women cry for no reason,&quot; was all his dad could say.
<br />The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering why women cry. 
<br />Finally he put in a call to God. When God got on the phone, he asked, &quot;God, why do women cry so easily?&quot;
<br />God said: &quot;When I made the woman she had to be special.
<br />I made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet gentle enough to give comfort.
<br />I gave her an inner strength to endure
<br />childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children.
<br />I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining.
<br />I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances, even when her child has hurt her very badly.
<br />I gave her strength to carry her husband
<br />through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart.
<br />I gave her wisdom to know that a good
<br />husband never hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly.
<br />And finally, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers exclusively to use whenever it is
<br />needed.&quot;
<br />&quot;You see my son,&quot; said God, &quot;the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she combs her hair.
<br />The beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because that is the doorway to her heart - the place where love resides.&quot;
