<br />And tell me your lies
<br />I can't escape you
<br />Nor can I deny
<br />Each day I wonder
<br />Such simple things
<br />What happened to me?
<br />Just hate the thought
<br />Of what it brings
<br /><br />Breathe tomorrow
<br />Or not at all
<br />I drown each time
<br />You utter these words
<br />If you only lie to me
<br />Why speak at all.

<br />Her parents kept her
<br />Locked in an attic
<br /><br />Her only friend
<br />was a little toy bear
<br />It was old and worn out
<br />And had patches of hair
<br /><br />She always talked to it
<br />When no one's around
<br />She lays there and hugs it
<br />Not a peep of sound
<br /><br />Until her parents
<br />unlock the door
<br />Some more and more pain
<br />She'll have to endore
<br /><br />A bruise on her leg
<br />A scar on her face
<br />Why would she be
<br />In such a horrible place?
<br /><br />But she grabs her bear
<br />And softly crys
<br />She loves her parents
<br />But they want her to die
<br /><br />She sits in the corner
<br />Quiet but thinking,
<br />&quot;Please God, why is
<br />My life always sinking? &quot;
<br /><br />Such a bad life
<br />For a sad little kid
<br />She'd get beaten and beaten
<br />For anything she did
<br /><br />Then one night
<br />Her mom came home high
<br />And the poor child was beaten
<br />As hours went by
<br /><br />Then her mom suddenly
<br />Grabbed for a blade
<br />It was sharp and pointy
<br />One that she made
<br /><br />She thrusted the blade
<br />Right in her chest,
<br />&quot;You deserve to die
<br />You worthless peice of shit!
<br /><br />The mom walked out
<br />Leaving the girl slowly dieing
<br />She grabbed her bear
<br />And again started crying
<br /><br />Police showed up
<br />At the small little house
<br />Then quickly barged in
<br />Everything quiet as a mouse
<br /><br />One officer slowly
<br />Opened a door
<br />To find the little girl
<br />Liing dead on the floor
<br /><br />It must have been bad
<br />To go through so much harm
<br />But at least she died
<br />With her best friend in her arms
<br /><br />A child dies every day from child abuse.
<br />And if you have an ounce of pity in you for Auroura (the little girl),
<br />and you hate child abuse with a passion,
<br />you will repost this and help out those abused children,
<br />and let them know that someone cares for them.
<br />It doesn't take that long only about 10 seconds
<br />so please just do it.
<br /><br />:
<br />she was only 5 and never loved ...
<br />if you dont repost this your a lazy, cold hearted person
<br />repost this saying: she was ONLY fucking 5

<br /><br />Nervous. This isn't quite like journal. I've spent hours coming back to this window - but my attension has been elsewhere. Friends with problems needing advice and support. The story of my life. Some say I should be a counsellor rather than an editor. Spend so much time working out problems. But friends are friends and they would (and have) done the same for me. 
<br /><br />*sighs* 
<br /><br />I'm back at my parent's for a couple of weeks. A short escape from the insanity that Sydney causes. Although, in a way, I miss it. 
<br />Here is good for some things and not others. It makes it easier - money wise, etc. But does little for my state of mind and emotions. Its funny, when im here I want to be in Sydney but when I'm in Sydney I want to be here. I think it's mainly the seperation that bothers me, yet nothing can be done about it. 
<br /><br />There are still shadows of my former self and they linger here.

<br />A day of dreams 
<br />Of coming magic 
<br />For all the children. 
<br />A night of loneliness 
<br />A night of sadness 
<br />There was only one dream left. 
<br />One has lost the magic 
<br />I'm too old now 
<br />My dream was broken 
<br />Upon waking 
<br />Presents yes 
<br />But no joy 
<br />Only tears. 
<br />Tears of sorrow, of love 
<br />Of the loss of hope, of desperation. 
<br />No one should be alone 
<br />This is not how christmas should be 
<br />A day for family ruined 
<br />How could they do that to you? 
<br />Before it was all sweet. 
<br /><br />The lights are off 
<br />The tinsel and tree pulled down 
<br />Everyone has gone 
<br />What a lie... 
<br />Each year is worse 
<br />Than the one before 
<br />We lie, it will be better 
<br />We try to live in hope. 
<br />There is no hope left. 
<br /><br />I give up on christmas. 
<br />I give up on relationships. 
<br />I give up on life. 
<br /><br />What kind of world 
<br />Kills its children? 
<br />What kind of world 
<br />Sends them to be killed? 
<br />And these people want to believe there is a God 
<br />And a heaven. 
<br />Why would God slaughter his children? 
<br />No, i think not. 
<br /><br />There is an angel 
<br />Who has saved me 
<br />From myself 
<br />I would save him 
<br />I would sell my soul for his happiness 
<br />Even though the world is determined to take him away 
<br />Like everyone else. 
<br />It fills me with anger 
<br />Sorrow 
<br />That neverending helplessness. 
<br />I will meet him at the Gates 
<br />If there is nothing else 
<br />The first dance is his 
<br />And that's all that matters.

<br />Why did you make it this way
<br />I feel so numb and empty
<br />Out of control
<br />I'm lost inside myself
<br />With no hope of escaping
<br /><br />Why do i still see you
<br />When this is all you do
<br />If i am damned to be away
<br />Then stop haunting me
<br />It would be easier with peace
<br />But then, its not really you is it
<br />You're not here
<br />You rarely speak
<br />I make you do it all
<br />You talk to me when i'm inside
<br /><br />I dont even have to close my eyes
<br />I know your there
<br />I know i do it to myself
<br />I make you hurt me
<br />Maybe because i feel bad
<br />You always said it wasnt my fault
<br />But there was always doubt on my behalf
<br /><br />I say i dont care
<br />But parts of me do
<br />There was a feeling once
<br />It went away 
<br />Just before you left me
<br />I miss it
<br /><br />I cant help it
<br />There is something i just keep on thinking
<br />Out of everyone (and i mean everyone)
<br />You are the only one who makes me jealous...

<br /><br />A Dedication...
<br /><br />Why are you crying?
<br />It wasn't supposed to be like this
<br />I'm being stupid and selfish
<br />Yet I still want to
<br /><br />Its been so long
<br />None of it was ever real
<br />So many regrets
<br />Nothing I can change
<br /><br />I shouldn't be doing this
<br />Reliving things long gone
<br />Thinking of you 
<br /><br />You're so close
<br />Yet we're further apart
<br />Than we've ever been
<br /><br />I want to step closer
<br />But that starts something
<br />I can't finish
<br /><br />I promised I wouldn't
<br />And I never will
<br />I'm better than that
<br /><br />Sometimes I just want 
<br />To see you 
<br />The way you really are
<br />With no camera to filter 
<br />The reality out
<br /><br />* Sorry I can't help it
<br />You're still beautiful *
<br /><br />~What counts as sexy?
<br />You. 
<br />You always have been~
<br /><br />You haunt me
<br />Almost five years on
<br />Stuck in my head
<br />Is a picture of you
<br /><br />WIll I ever
<br />Be able to walk away
<br />Without
<br />Clinging to your memory

<br />And hold out your hand
<br />No one will ever know
<br />Or try to understand
<br /><br />Another dream passed by
<br />Unseen or neglected
<br />Swallowed by the darkness
<br />Left by my soul
<br /><br />One hand reaches for help
<br />While the other holds me down
<br />People pass me by
<br />They don't realise
<br />They're watching me drown
<br /><br />Smiles can only hide so much
<br />One day people will see
<br />They pushed the darkness in
<br />And just let me be.

<br />Enter left and get lost
<br />End of Days – can’t you see I’m like you
<br />I guess I never will be
<br />The things I see inside
<br />While I sit here
<br />Out of my mind
<br /><br />Sometimes I think he sees
<br />Through the smile
<br />Sometimes I think he knows I want
<br />To talk
<br />But can’t quite manage to
<br />Say the words trapped inside
<br />He isn’t forward enough to ask
<br />I guess he figures I’d say fine
<br />Which is probably true
<br /><br />This place makes me numb
<br />It makes me want to feel
<br />And that is bad
<br />There were marks on my palms
<br />I see me in the middle, arms out
<br />It running, dripping on the floor
<br />A look of horror
<br />Then I blink and it falls away
<br />I just want to feel.

<br />Should I cut my heart out? 
<br />I have nothing else to give 
<br />Every thing else has been taken away 
<br />I don’t care any more 
<br />I can’t take the pain 
<br />I hate you all for what you’ve done to me 
<br />Can’t you just pretend to love me? 
<br />Tell me what I want to hear 
<br />I don’t care 
<br />You don’t want me 
<br />No one ever wants me 
<br />Not for long 
<br />I’m only good while it’s a game 
<br />Shame I never saw it that way 
<br />But that’s all i am wanted for 
<br />So it doesn’t last long 
<br />And you can stop when you get sick of it 
<br />Why do you do this to me? 
<br />I’m sick of feeling like this. 
<br />I’m sick of being caught in this endless cycle 
<br />Am I really that bad 
<br />That you all can’t stand being with me 
<br />For any length of time? 
<br />It hurts so very much 
<br />Knowing that it was all 
<br />A lie 
<br />A game 
<br />It’s real for me 
<br />It’s my life you’re playing with 
<br />Don’t you understand that? 
<br />Should I cut my heart out 
<br />And give it to you? 
<br />Would that make it real? 
<br />But real isn’t what you want 
<br />It never was 
<br />I was just convenient 
<br />And I hate you for it 
<br />I wish I could walk away 
<br />Speak to me tomorrow 
<br />And I’ll love you again. 
<br />So you can play your games 
<br />It doesn’t matter 
<br />A week from now I’ll hate you again 
<br />For this hopeless feeling 
<br />Of being used and unloved. 
<br />Unwanted. 
<br />One day you’ll leave me 
<br />Someone else will come

<br />They will only hurt you again

<br /><br />Since I’ve sat alone in the semi-darkness
<br />And let the thoughts run through me
<br />Its been even longer
<br />Since I’ve stayed outside long enough
<br />To let my thoughts carry me away
<br />An artist, yes, that’s what it was about
<br />An artist who saw the things I see
<br />His form borrowed from outside reality
<br />But it is an older thought
<br /><br />I always said my work could be divine
<br />If I could just find an artist who saw things like I do
<br />The full moon above the mist covered plain
<br />The girl standing in front of it all
<br /><br />The star lit sky all around
<br /><br />Its been awhile
<br /><br />Since I’ve sat in front of the computer
<br />And wrote what ever came to mind
<br /><br />Its been even longer
<br />Since I’ve had anything to say
<br /><br />There have always been dreams 
<br />That are beyond my words
<br /><br />It is what inspires me
<br />All I want is to show you all what I see
<br /><br />It wouldn’t be the same if I was the only one who knew
<br />Why the girl was here, standing alone in the mist
<br />With only the heavens to guide her
<br /><br />It wouldn’t be right if I never shared the feelings
<br />That were trapped when I heard about Dwayne
<br /><br />How could I ever bring meaning to the endless dreams
<br />If I never wrote them down
<br />How could I make sense of what she did
<br />If I never relived it over and over again
<br />How could I ever accept how he is
<br />If I never looked deep inside the picture
<br />To see how things are in the realm of fantasy
<br /><br />That’s right
<br /><br />An artist
<br /><br />A picture speaks a thousand words
<br />A writer sees the picture and tries to find the right thousand words
<br /><br />To show it to every one
<br /><br />I once found my artist, he may not have known it
<br />But the life inside the picture was a brilliant place
<br /><br />Sadly, as much art does, it faded away
<br />It remains buried back in someone’s mind
<br /><br />Waiting to be rediscovered
<br /><br />Until then, there are only the dreams
<br /><br />It is an interesting experience
<br /><br />Watching someone dream
<br /><br />To see their eyes move beneath the skin and know
<br /><br />Their subconscious mind is speaking right before you
<br /><br />Yet you cannot, and most likely will not, ever see what they saw
<br /><br />To know that what they see feels real when you know it’s not
<br /><br />Each dream has its own story
<br />Whether created via emotion or influenced by imitations of life
<br />Something can always be made of it
<br />There is so much I see, so much that sparks that feeling
<br />The urge to pour out these thoughts
<br /><br />There are so many images that pass through my head
<br /><br />I just need an artist
<br /><br />To make them as real for you as they are for me

<br />There is nothing left to tell you
<br />I feel emptied 
<br />All because of you
<br />Why do you make me feel like this
<br />Why are you the only one
<br />Who  fucks me up
<br />No matter what you do. 
<br /><br />I want to hate you
<br />For everything you do to me
<br />I think i've already proven
<br />That hate is something i cant do
<br />Not to you at least
<br /><br />It seems you mean a lot more to me
<br />Than what i mean to you
<br />What can i say?
<br />I'm sorry
<br />I never intended it to be like this
<br />I dont even know how to stop
<br /><br />I feel blind
<br />Stumbling around in the dark
<br />You were the hand
<br />That guided me to the edge
<br />Then pushed me down
<br /><br />No one breaks me the way you do
<br />So feel proud
<br />You can make a girl cry
<br />Just by existing
<br />The sad thing is
<br />She would still cry 
<br />If you didnt exist at all.

<br />Struggling to free themselves
<br />From the numbness
<br />I don’t want to remember
<br />The things you did
<br />Yet I will never escape them
<br />I will never escape you
<br />The pain you caused
<br /><br />I feel the hate rise up
<br />The anger build inside
<br />But I fight it
<br /><br />I resent myself
<br />For letting you do that
<br />For believing what you said
<br />He said
<br />I hate what you made me do
<br />And I will never forgive you for that
<br /><br />You abused him
<br />But every word you said
<br />Was about yourself
<br />You used me
<br />But I don’t know why
<br /><br />I want to rip my heart out
<br />When I look at the things he said
<br />That you said
<br />How could you do that
<br />I trusted you
<br />Where every word you said about him
<br />Was about yourself
<br />Every word I said about him
<br />Was about you
<br /><br />The more I think of it
<br />The worse it is
<br />A fight between my best mate
<br />And my best friend
<br />To learn that they are one and the same
<br /><br />You know why we drew apart?
<br />You put more time into making
<br />Him my friend
<br />Than you spent being my friend
<br />You gave me an obsession
<br />With someone you “knew”
<br />Of course you would be the one
<br />I’d talk to about him
<br />And he’d be the one
<br />I’d talk to about you
<br /><br />Did you think you never made me angry?
<br />Right till the end I wanted to believe
<br />That you weren’t behind this
<br />We were friends
<br />I’m sorry if I wasn’t as good as you wanted
<br />Expected
<br />But at least I tried
<br />You are the betrayer
<br />I hope you remember that
<br />Until the day you die

<br />Reality folds back on itself
<br />I feel that I'm stuck in the middle
<br />Nothing will ever be good enough
<br />As situations change
<br />This place brings back
<br />So much internal conflict
<br />It forces me to question, doubt
<br />Mistrust
<br />Worry about things long dead
<br />So I thought
<br />But apparently not
<br />It feels like every other time
<br />I've sat in my room
<br />Unsure of myself
<br />Knowing it will never
<br />Be good enough.

<br /><br />Anyways, I came just came across this. *smiles* I remember it. He was going to sing it to me for Christmas the year things went badly. 
<br /><br />~My Angel~ (by Raven)
<br /><br />So sweet
<br />So beautiful
<br />Everyday like a queen
<br />On her thrown
<br />Don't nobody know 
<br />how she feels
<br />Angel lady
<br />one day we'll be real
<br />She moves, She moves like a breeze
<br />I swear I can't get her outa my dreams
<br />To have her shining 
<br />Right here by my side
<br />I'd sacrifice
<br />All the tears in my eyes
<br />Oh woa woa woa
<br />My angel My angel
<br />Passing me by (there she goes again)
<br />My angel My angel
<br />My my my.....
<br />My angel My angel
<br />Smile for me now
<br />I don't know, I don't know
<br />My angel
<br />In my life 
<br />Where would I be 
<br />right now (with out you)
<br />I would not be so happy
<br />or so proud
<br />To say that you are 
<br />my friend
<br />My only angel
<br />Lending me a hand
<br />My angel My angel
<br />So beautiful and sweet
<br />My Angel My Angel
<br />One day I know we shall meet....(My angel...)

<br />Everything has shifted
<br />I don't know what to say anymore
<br />Nothing is how it should be
<br /><br />I don't want to fight
<br />I don't want to feel guilty
<br />I don't want to hurt
<br />I don't want to be afraid
<br /><br />People have been odd recently
<br />My friends all seem to be down
<br />Depression, drugs and eating disorders
<br />We are plagued
<br />All lost yet desperate to help
<br /><br />We're getting together soon
<br />Hoping to make things normal
<br />Whatever that is
<br /><br />I still feel insane
<br />Living by obsession
<br />While people bring me their pain
<br />To share, of course
<br /><br />Who can change this?
<br />I have my doubts
<br />That is half the problem
<br />Inside it's getting worse
<br /><br />I keep thinking of doing things
<br />I know I shouldn't
<br />My emotions are numb
<br />The drowning has begun
<br /><br />I do it to myself
<br />I know
<br />Part of me likes the pain
<br />So I make it hurt
<br />Sitting here listening
<br />To &quot;My Immortal&quot; on repeat
<br />Just to remember the feelings
<br />Of the day I left
<br />Just to feel guilty
<br /><br />Oh yes, I make it numb
<br />Scratch and claw
<br />Maybe I'll feel again
<br />Find my way out
<br />Or maybe there'll be nothing left
<br /><br />~~~~
<br />I'm sorry in a way. I've been feeling gloomy for awhile now. The sinking, drowning, numb feeling has filled me once again. I guess this is why I was unsure about coming back here. Everything tends to fall away, leaving me staring at the wall crying with no real reason for anything. The world is always ending here, and the stress doesn't help me. It's funny, I don't dream at all in Sydney but here I do nothing but watch dream after dream play before my eyes. I talked to Leish for awhile tonight, and that made me feel a little better. We are going to catch up on Friday, and she says she'll even write me a letter for old times sake. I should write her one as well. But there are many people to write to, and currently i don't feel up to it. There are things to tell Alex, cause she understands where no one else really seems to. Hopefully she can sort my head out. 
<br /><br />And yes, I still ramble about seemingly unrelated things. I promise it makes sense in my head.... *sighs* I really should go to bed, yet part of me is fighting the urge to sleep just to stay a little bit longer. 
<br /><br />I don't see how it will make any difference. Even if what i am waiting for happens, I still would be stuck at the same point i am now - what to say? 
<br /><br />Considering things are starting to become surreal and blurring as my eyes try to shut down, I better go. 
<br /><br />Good night all.
<br /><br />~love~

<br />Left on the floor
<br />I wont be held
<br />I wont be left
<br />You will never take me
<br /><br />I may be little
<br />But I believe
<br />You can't hurt me
<br />You wont hurt me
<br />Cause I'm better
<br /><br />You're lucky I wasnt there
<br />I wouldn't have got in the car
<br />And drove away
<br />I wouldn't have backed down
<br />The metal bar doesnt change anything
<br />Smash something of mine
<br />I put thousands into that
<br />Whether the door or window 
<br />Can be replaced
<br />What gives you the right?
<br />I can guarentee
<br />He'd be the last of your worries
<br />I wouldn't take that
<br /><br />Ever since that first day
<br />You made me uncomfortable
<br />Rude and inappropriate actions
<br />You are nothing more than
<br />An undying source of anger and frustration
<br /><br />Just....
<br />Fuck off and leave us alone.

I have to attend training 4 hours a day for the next 3 weeks - starting Monday. The only small hope is I may be eligible for a government grant to start my own business - something I was going to do anyway... It may also get me out of the 3 weeks of shit. Here's to hoping.
