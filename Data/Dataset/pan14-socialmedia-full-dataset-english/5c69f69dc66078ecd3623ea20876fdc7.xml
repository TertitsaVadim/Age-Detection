<br /><br />If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?
<br /><br />When everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane. 
<br /><br />I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out.
<br /><br />I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder.
<br /><br />For Sale: Parachute. Only used once, never opened, small stain.
<br /><br />Do you have trouble making up your mind? Well, yes or no?
<br /><br />If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.
<br /><br />Many people quit looking for work when they find a job.
<br /><br />When I'm not in my right mind, my left mind gets pretty crowded.
<br /><br />Everyone has a photographic memory.  Some just don't have film. 
<br /><br />You know the speed of light, so what's the speed of dark?
<br /><br />Join The Army, Visit exotic places, meet strange people, then kill them.
<br /><br />I poured Spot remover on my dog. Now he's gone.
<br /><br />Evening news is where they begin with 'Good evening', and then proceed to tell you why it isn't.
<br /><br />Before borrowing money from a friend, decide which you need more.(Friend or Money !)
<br /><br />Death is hereditary.
<br /><br />There are three sides to any argument: your side, my side and the right side.
<br /><br />An consultant is someone who takes a subject you understand and makes it sound confusing.
<br /><br />Never argue with a fool. People might not know the difference.
<br /><br />When you're right, no one remembers. When you're wrong, no one forgets.
<br /><br />Cheer up, the worst is yet to come.
<br /><br />Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.
<br /><br />Everyone makes mistakes. The trick is to make mistakes when nobody is looking.
<br /><br />They say hard work never hurts anybody, but why take the chance.
<br /><br />Always borrow money from a pessimist.  He won't expect it back.
<br /><br />I like work.  It fascinates me.  I  sit and look at it for hours.
<br /><br />If you can't see the bright side of life, polish the dull side.
<br /><br />Where there's a will, there are five hundred relatives.
<br /><br />Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.

<br /><br />The snow, so peaceful and serene,
<br />caressed by the soft moonlight,
<br />gave magical feelings to the night.
<br /><br />The soft blue glow,
<br />the lovers' words that then did flow,
<br />their lips closer and closer
<br />until, locked in the throes
<br />of a passionate embrace,
<br />he decided to express his feelings,
<br />to keep her safe.
<br /><br />He whispered softly,
<br />his words like music to her ears,
<br />&quot;I Love You,&quot;
<br />and her response the same,
<br />heard like the gentle breeze,
<br />&quot;And I, love you, forever.&quot;
<br /><br />That was the night they promised
<br />to be together through everything,
<br />each to care for the other when old and gray
<br />A lovers' pact
<br />the most likely to last.

<br />Her the lady, he the knight 
<br />And knelt before her on the ground 
<br />Her hands within his own he bound 
<br />And gazed into her starlit eyes 
<br />Illuminated by the lunar rise 
<br />And smiling, produced to her a ring 
<br />A trinket to most, a trifled thing 
<br />And said to her those words she dreamed 
<br />And faltered not, although it seemed 
<br />He would. 
<br /><br />And she, exuberant, looking down 
<br />Could not recall when last she'd frowned 
<br />Though tears flowed freely down her face 
<br />And settled on her moonlit lace 
<br />Her face bespoke rapturous elation 
<br />Outshining God's surrounding creations 
<br />And opening her delicate mouth 
<br />One whispered word made to slip out 
<br />And soared across the enchanted night 
<br />And on his ears it made to alight 
<br />With growing cheer upon its advent 
<br />His heart soared forth whenst it gained the content 
<br />And all doubts dashed he embraced her dearly 
<br />For though it seemed unlikely, 
<br />She would. 
<br /><br />And spinning upon that ghostly hill 
<br />That gorgeous spine of earth instilled 
<br />It seemed, with all the wonder of the world 
<br />This dear young couple their hearts unfurled 
<br />And then, exuberance smiting his face 
<br />He stepped away to leave her place 
<br />She glanced and questioned lovingly 
<br />Where go thou now, my dearest sweet? 
<br />And to the world his voice he hurled 
<br />&quot;I think, my dear, I shall conquer the world.&quot;

<br />&quot;Hey Scott, it's time for bed&quot;
<br />&quot;You go ahead&quot; he answered
<br />&quot;I'll surf the net instead&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You sure love that computer&quot;
<br />Concern rose in her voice
<br />&quot;But why would you go surfing?
<br />You have another choice&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'll only be a minute
<br />I've got some work to do
<br />But you know I would rather
<br />Just climb in bed with you&quot;
<br /><br />So off to bed went Karen
<br />And all alone to sleep
<br />While Scotty started surfin'
<br />And the surf was getting deep
<br /><br />Much later she awakened
<br />The blankets seemed so hot
<br />She felt the space beside her
<br />And wondered, where was Scott?
<br /><br />&quot;I wonder what he's doing
<br />I'm getting up to see
<br />He's surely out there dozing
<br />I'll tiptoe quietly&quot;
<br /><br />The keyboard it was silent
<br />The screen tho' flickered bright
<br />What was it he was doing
<br />In the middle of the night?
<br /><br />She crept right up behind him
<br />Then peeked around to see
<br />And on the screen before her
<br />As naked as can be
<br /><br />Were two young lovely women
<br />Endowed in every way
<br />One was named Miss April
<br />The other was Miss May
<br /><br />&quot;So Scott, what are you watching? &quot;
<br />The screen went blank just then
<br />&quot;Ah- nothing really honey
<br />Just news from CNN&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh CNN my eyeball
<br />Those girls had nothing on&quot;
<br />He said &quot;Oh yes I saw them
<br />Their clothing was all gone&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;And that fact did concern me
<br />It made me wonder when
<br />They started going topless
<br />On good old CNN&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why I'll just call the network
<br />And make a big complaint&quot;
<br />&quot;Don't bother&quot; muttered Karen
<br />&quot;Cause foolin' me you ain't&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Those girls were Playboy Bunnies
<br />They're different from their peers
<br />Aside from wearing nothing
<br />They had on floppy ears&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Was that the Playboy website? &quot;
<br />Scott said convincingly
<br />&quot;Those girls are always naked? ?
<br />That's what you're telling me? ? &quot;
<br /><br />She raised her hand for silence
<br />He knew that he was caught
<br />And further explanation
<br />Would only get her hot
<br /><br />He stood there feeling foolish
<br />Uncertain of his fate
<br />But she just whispered to him
<br />&quot;Let's go, it's getting late&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Just come to bed now Scotty&quot;
<br />But know that in this house
<br />If you surf the Playboy website
<br />You just might lose your mouse&quot;

<br /><br />A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose. 
<br /><br />Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil; without saying a word. 
<br /><br />In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. 
<br /><br />She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. 
<br /><br />She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. 
<br /><br />Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl.  Turning to her daughter, she asked, &quot;Tell me what you see.&quot;  &quot;Carrots, eggs, and coffee,&quot; she replied. 
<br /><br />Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft. 
<br /><br />The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg. 
<br /><br />Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma The daughter then asked, &quot;What does it mean, mother?&quot; 
<br /><br />Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity: boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened The ground coffee beans were unique, however.  After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water. 
<br /><br />&quot;Which are you?&quot; she asked her daughter. &quot;When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? 
<br /><br />Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? 
<br /><br />Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?  Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart? 
<br /><br />Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavour. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you. 
<br /><br />When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? 
<br /><br />May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy. 
<br /><br />The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. 
<br /><br />When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. 
<br /><br />Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. 
<br /><br />You might want to send this message to those people who mean something to you (I JUST DID); to those who have touched your life in one way or another; to those who make you smile when you really need it; to those who make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down; to those whose friendship you appreciate; to those who are so meaningful in your life. 
<br /><br />If you don't send it, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message! 
<br /><br />It's easier to build a child than repair an adult. This is so true. 
<br /><br />May we all be COFFEE
