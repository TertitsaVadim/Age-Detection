<br />Head, Department of Theatre &amp; Cultural Studies
<br />Nasarawa State University, Keffi
<br /><br />With the astronomical increase of mobile internet users from nearly zero users in the year 2000 to eighty-three million in 2010, Nigeria stands out as a country with one of the fastest internet penetration rates in the world. A large percentage of these Nigerian &quot;Netizens&quot; spend most of their netlife exchanging diverse information on various social network sites like facebook, 2go, twitter, blackbery messenger and  YouTube. In contrast with the traditional media, these social media platforms are more interractive, accessible, less regulated and enjoy a freer and decentralised ownership and control structure. Consequently, the process of agenda setting, news gathering and dissemination hitherto controlled by traditional Media outfits owned by either government or few wealthy individuals has been liberalised. As preparations for the 2011 elections gathered momentum, different civil society organisations engaged in diverse Cyber-Activism to educate and mobilise voters towards a credible election. The politicians also utilised these social media to reach potential voters in the same way that the independent national electoral commission and the ordinary voters employed the new media to monitor the 2011 electorals. This paper evaluates the potentials and contributions of the social media to the internationally acclaimed success of the 2011 elections in Nigeria. It also seeks to uncover novel approaches from the Nigerian 2011 experience that can deepen the levels of engagement between the civil societies and the ordinary Citizen in the continuous search for more credible elections and good governance.

<br />Assistant Editor (Arts)
<br /><br />The newly elected executive of the Society of Nigeria Theatre Artists (SONTA), led by Prof. Emmanuel S. Dandaura rose from a recent interactive session with arts writers in Abuja more determined on the need to reposition theatre practice, make its abundant human resources available for national development as well as initiate a regulatory framework for the practice of the profession in the country. The gathering that was attended by some past and present executive members of SONTA and senior theatre art scholars from various universities unanimously agreed that the association, which is the umbrella body for theatre practitioners in the country, is perceived to be asleep except during its convention. 
<br />Worried by this erroneous impression, the current president of the association, Prof. Dandaura said its executive would soon embark on networking and consultation with other theatre practitioners across the country with a view to come up with a bill that would be presented to the National Assembly for the regulation and promotion of standard practices in the profession. He said the association is long overdue for a regulatory framework and a proper instrument for the regulation of the practice, which is why the National Endowment for the Art (NEA), has been elusive these past years. “As a professional body, there are lots of talents in our fold that are being under-utilised. Sixty professors of theatre arts are with SONTA who are grossly under-utilised. We need to make them available to tap from. This is part of the philosophy of the new executive,” he added. 
<br />Prof. Ayo Akinwale observed that despite the wrong notion that the association has been inactive SONTA has not only been publishing journals that cover news on current research findings but working hard to uplift the profession. He cited the prompt response of the association to the rumoured sale of the National Theatre complex in Lagos and the split of the National Troupe of Nigeria and National Theatre management boards by federal government. He however warned that if SONTA must make impact on government, ‘we must talk with one voice so long as we are ready to face the challenges confronting the association.’ This was corroborated by the deputy vice chancellor of University of Jos, Prof. Dauda Enna Musa, who disclosed that Nigerian theatre journal is one of the Educational Trust Fund listed journals for publication on indigenous researches. He noted that more than ever before, art would face more challenges because of sciences. 
<br />In his contribution, one of Nigeria’s leading theatre scholars, Prof. Kalu Uka, enjoined the practitioners to make the profession visible at the post primary school level in order to have a steady and continuous flow of interest from that level of academic training. He regretted that SONTA lost out in the struggle to realize this objective saying, ‘I hope SONTA will not fail in this effort again.’
<br />He stressed that the concern of the association is not the quacks but the need to have an academy that would lift the profession because Nigerians love entertainment. He described Nollywood phenomenon as gap filler that was very necessary at the time it came. 
<br />Continuing, he said: “It is time we started honouring our own stars deliberately so. What is happening in Nollywood is because there is no alternative. We need independent sources of funding for SONTA to thrive. We can’t let theatre die

<br /><br />By NWAGBO NNENYELIKE
<br />Thursday, April 01, 2010
<br />As the only Theatre Arts Department in Nigeria offering a combination of Theatre Arts and culture, Nasarawa State University, Keffi (NSUK) is indeed unique. Many of such departments in Nigerian Universities are popular for combining theatre with film, mass communication or Creative Arts. For example University of Lagos has Theatre and creative arts units, while University of Nigeria Nuskka has Theatre and Film Studies.
<br />Meanwhile, many Universities have only Theatre Arts department as obtained at the University of Ibadan, University of Benin etc.
<br />However, the young department at Nasarawa was only two weeks old on February 26, when the Society of Nigeria Theatre Artists (SONTA) organized a gala night to honour of the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Shamsdeen Amali, who is a scholar of Theatre Arts himself.
<br />As the first Professor of Theatre Arts to become a Vice Chancellor in any Nigerian University, Amali earlier served at the University of Ilorin and performed creditably befor assuming office in NSUK.
<br />According to Steven Lawani, Deputy Governor of Benue State, the uniqueness of the department of theatre and culture is commendable. He said: “The truth is that the appointment of Prof. Amali as the Vice Chancellor of NSUK is remarkable and unique to the Department of Theatre and Cultural Studies. He is a bilingual playwright. This means he is rooted in culture. That will benefit the department.’’ Mr. John Michael Abdul, Deputy Governor of Nasarawa State who represented the state Governor, Alhaji Aliyu Akwe Doma corroborated this point.
<br />In fact in the northern part of the country, both Governor Akwe Doma and Vice Chancellor are well respected in the field of culture. This is because both of them share many things in common. For instance in 1966, Alh Akwe Doma was part of the contingents that went to Senegal Festival of Arts and Culture in Dakar, while the VC published some of his poems that are rooted in culture the same year.
<br />However, running appropriate courses to enable the university attain the highest standard is a priority to Gov. Akwe Doma, his colleagues in the thespian arts and culture becomes inevitable to carry out the assignment.
<br />Also with the priority to relate its courses to the social, cultural and economic needs of the people of Nasarawa State, theatre and cultural studies became germane. This is in line with the observation of Dr. Barclays Ayakoroma, the executive Secretary and Chief Executive Officer of the National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO) who noted that with the combination of the Governor, the visitor and VC as cultural experts, the department has the greatest prospects.
<br />“I congratulate the HOD of Theatre and Cultural Studies at NSUK. The Department is unique and blessed. In the state the people have Governor who is the visitor to the University as an arts and culture person. They also have a VC who is as an arts and culture person. Presenting a gift of projector and a screen to encourage its cultural activities like documentation, NICO boss said the department and the Institute share qualities. “In NICO we encourage development of culture and cultural officers. The fact that the department will teach its students culture, is in line with the development of culture and students of culture. The graduates will be rooted in cultural practice.
<br />Dr. Ayakoroma further stated “In view if this, NICO identifies totally with the department. Apart from the screen and the projector for documentation of audio-visual aspects of cultural activities and events, we have books in NICO that we feel would be important for the young department in research on cultural studies’’
<br />The National President of SONTA, Professor Emmanuel Dandaura also buttressed Ayakoroma “In fact the inclusion of culture in our name is the best thing that has happened to theatre arts.
<br />This is because theatre arts cannot be divorced from culture as culture is integral aspect of the theatre. With our amiable Governor and our VC as people of culture the department has a double glory. The VC is a rare breed and a literary legend. The VC is the first Nigerian to obtain PhD in modern drama as well as first professor of modern drama. At the University of Jos, he was part of those who developed the Theatre Arts department. He was HOD of the department. He was chairman of the Academic Staff Union of the University in UNIJOS between 1980 and 1982. So our department will benefit from his wealth of experience.’’

<br />Friday, March 25, 2011
<br /><br />People may call it a rare dinner for strange bed fellows, but Monday’s meeting and felicitation with actors and musicians by President Goodluck Jonathan was indeed, a welcome development. For the first time ever, a Nigerian leader had time to sit with artistes in a relaxed atmosphere to deliberate on issues that can move their profession forward.
<br />And so, actors; particularly Nollywood stars, musicians, dramatists, visual artists, writers, producers,comedians, among many others, had the privilege of dining and wining with Mr President at the Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. It was a unique gathering of who is who in Nigeria’s creative and showbiz sectors.
<br />The roll call was simply intimidating as artists of different generations; the old, the middle-aged, the young and the very young came to heed President Jonathan’s call for wider consultations and mutual interaction. Among those in attendance were foremost painter and print maker, Bruce Onobrakpeya, music lover and playwright; Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi, famous batik maker Nike Okundaye, top Nollywood stars/filmmakers Justus Esiri, Eddie Ugbomah, Olu Jacobs, Lere Paimo,Jimoh Aliu, Enebeli Elebuwa, Mahmoud Ali-Balogun as well as singers Onyeka Onwenu, Sammy Okposo, Daddy Showkey, D’Banj, Azu Ekiye, Victor Eyiara, among many others.
<br />Essentially, the stakeholders’ meeting with the President raised hopes of a better tomorrow for the body of Nigerian artists, who were offered an opportunity to air their views on issues afftecting their different professions. The artists too showed solidarity with the President’s mission, while exuding enthusiasm in meeing their leader face to face in a relaxed atmosphere.
<br />Witha curtain raiser in Jim Jakolo’s melodic solo, the colourful evening took off with Oronto Douglas’ introductory remarks. As the President Special Assistance on Research, Documentation and Stragegy, Douglas reminded the gathering of the various achievements of his boss, who is seeking another opportunity to rule the country in the April elections. He disclosed Jonathan’s commitment to a progressive and peaceful nation, using the platform of good governance that places value on energy, security and education.
<br />Long befor the President’s response, representatives of the various arts organisations and associations made their contributions while the President listened attentively. At the end of the “Talk To President” session, one thing was clear-that without getting rid of piracy, or reducing it to the barest minimum, the entire creative/entertainment industry would know no respite because all the gains by practitioners would continue to be harnessed illegally by pirates. Among the various speakers were Busola Halloway(ITPAN), Alhaji Sani Muazu(Kaniwood), Greg Odutayo(NANTAP), Dr Uwa Usen (SNA), Prof Emmanuel Dandaura (SONTA),Dr Sunday Ododo (ANA),Ben Tomoloju (CONA), Victor Ashaolu (ANTP),Amaka Igwe, Segun Arinze (Actors Guild),Zeb Ejiro, Tony Okoroji, Austin Eguavon (who spoke for sportsmen and women)and Stephane Okereke.
<br />In his response, President Jonathan disclosed that his consultation with members of the creative community was strategic. According to him, the idea was not merely to canvass votes in view of the elections but to interact with artists and intellectual property owners on the possibility of creating jobs for the youth. Jonathan who described artists, writers and sportsmen as specially gifted people also obeserved that as a nation, Nigeria can make a good name out of creativity.
<br />President Jonathan who said that his aim was to identify possible areas of partnership with artists on job creation also said’’ The arts and entertainment sector is a key sector of our economy and government needs to be closer to the industries. We know that without handling piracy, we cannot succeed and we need a strong body that can look at the existing laws with the hope of strenghtening them to deal with the culprits.
<br />On the issue of 200million dollars entertainment fund, I can assure you that government will continue to provide more funds to empower the sector as at when necessary. The one we released is just the starting point. We shall be making more funds available as long as we deem it necessary.’’
<br /><br />People may call it a rare dinner for strange bed fellows, but Monday’s meeting and felicitation with actors and musicians by President Goodluck Jonathan was indeed, a welcome development. For the first time ever, a Nigerian leader had time to sit with artistes in a relaxed atmosphere to deliberate on issues that can move their profession forward.

<br />Thursday, April 01, 2010 the sun newspaper
<br /><br />Perhaps the joy of a theatre scholar is incomplete until his or her work is celebrated alongside his or her personality. Prof Shamshudeen Amali’s joy knew no bounds recently when his proteges and colleagues in the theatre profession celebrated his life and achievemnts in Keffi, Nasarawa State. 
<br /><br />Amali, who has recorded many firsts in the course of his career, is currently the Vice Chancellor of Nasarawa State University, Keffi. He was honoured with a lifetime achievement award by the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artistes (SONTA), currently headed by Professor Emmanuel Dandaura. 
<br /><br />The intermittent power outage notwithstanding, the 1000-seat auditorium, venue of the ceremony, rallied dignitaries, students, lecturers, artistes and friends of Prof Amali who came to pay homage to him. The guests including two deputy governors (Nasararwa and Benue) as well as notable scholars were already seated. When the show opened with a short poem entitled A Scroll of Honour. The latter was recited by Prof. Sam Kafewo of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) also signalled the beginning of the programme which SONTA and its members would remember for a long time to come. As chief organiser and Head of Theatre and Cultural studies, Prof  reminded guests that Amali, was being celebrated for his numerous achievements. He recalled the celebrant as a foremost scholar who first bagged a PhD in drama in the whole of Northern Nigeria. Amali also scored a first by being the first playwright to become a Vice Chancellor who is a theatre artist. It was in recognition of these achievemnts that SONTA decided to honour him. 
<br /><br />As the ceremony progressed with a mixture of tributes and performances, the artistes from Benue State Council for Arts and Culture thrilled guests with their energetic, yet rhythmic dancesteps, including the Swange. 
<br />The young artistes also performed one of Professor Amali’s plays to the delight of all. The solo dancer from Benue also dazed the crowd with his mersmerising ‘cat’ movements just as the drama students from the university of Jos also entertained with a dance drama. 
<br /><br />Meanwhile, artistes of the Nasarawa Council for Arts and Culture reminsced their usual victory joker in their uniqueshaking of waists and legs. They exhibited a lot of confidence in their episodic dance pieces which showcased high level of creative choreography. The show was so overwhelming that an attempt by the compere to stop Nasarawa dancers was resisted by students inside the auditorium. Infact, a tumiltous applause heralded the second coming of the dancers who have gained attention of the students-dominated crowd. 
<br /><br />The performers continued with excerpts from Prof Amali’s play; Odegwudegwu by Theatre students from the Ahmadu Bello university and University of Abuja. But students of Theatre &amp; Culture Studies, of the Nasarawa State University made history by offering the audience their first stage show ever. They also gave a creative interpretation of Professor Amali’s play and ended it up with an inspiring performance aided by symbols and elements. The students who had barely spent three weeks on campus no doubt gave a promising performance that reflected the high quality of their teachers and instructors. 
<br /><br />More tributes however poured in for the celebrant when the two deputy governors-Chief Steven Lawan of Benue and Chief Michael Abdul of Nasarawa extolled Amali’s virtues. They both described Amali as an outstanding celebrant who has distinguished himself not merely as university administrator, but as professor of Theatre Studies. 
<br /><br />As a bilingual playwright and notable theatre scholar, Amali was also a unionist at the university of Jos before serving as Vice Chancellor at the University of Ilorin for five years. His track record of performance in Kwara naturally prepared him for his new position as the pioneer chief executive of the young Nasarawa State University, Keffi. In addition to these, Amali who is also married to a professor of Economics was acknowledged for his great contributions to the development of culture in Nigeria. 
<br /><br />The ceremony came to aclimax when a fellow scholar and accomplished theatre professor, Dapo Adelugba was summoned to present the SONTA Lifetime Achievement Award to Amali. Amid joy, tributes and felicitations. Amali who has carved a niche for himself as a creative writer and outstanding administrator became the man of the moment for all theatre artists in attendance. 
<br /><br />Among scholars and dignitaries who graced the show was Dr Barclays Ayakoroma, Executive Director of the National Institute for Culturl Orientation (NICO) who made book donations to the University. Others include Prof Ayo Akinwale, Prof Mabel Evwierhoma, Prof Femi Shaka, Prof Julie Okoh, Prof Jenkeri Okwori, Prof Saint Gbilekaa, and Prof Ebere Amali, Prof Zynab Alkali among others.

<br /><br />His Excellency, Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Johnathan, GCFR
<br />President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Presidential Candidate of the PDP
<br /><br />Your Excellencies, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Governors and our great political leaders here present
<br /><br />For want of time, I beg to stand on existing protocol
<br /><br />Mr President, let me begin by acknowledging that what we are witnesssing here today is unique, unprecedented and politically most strategic initiative ever to be undertaken by a sitting President of this great country or any Presidential candidate for that matter in Nigeria. A pre-election meeting with the critical stakeholders in the Arts, culture and entertainment sector of our economy is the smartest move anybody aspiring to win election as President of Nigeria could take. Mr President, it goes without saying that when you have the minds of a people, you have their votes! Sitting before you this evening, Mr President are men and women who shape and control the minds of majority of Nigerians by virtue of their creative talents.To have assembled us here at this time marks you out, our President, as a great Man indeed who is worthy of our support and partnership.
<br /><br />The Society of Nigeria Theatre Artists (SONTA) is one of the oldest professional Associations of Performing Artists in Nigeria. It has in its fold all the Professors and teachers of theatre, drama, music and communication arts in the country. Our membership includes the trained professional artists in the arts councils, cultural centres, and private performing companies in the cities and villages. Mr President, I am happy to note that our members have continued to provide Valuable services to successive Governments in Nigeria from inception. In your Government today, Mr President, SONTA members include one Cabinet Minister, Mr Sam Odeh, one Ambassador, His Excellency, Professor Iyorwuese Hagher, your High Commissioner to Canada,(he is on SONTA's delegation to this dinner) one Executive Governor, Alhaji Aliyu Akwe Doma of Nasarawa  State, two serving Vice- Chancellors of Nigerian Universities, Professor Shamsudeen O.O. Amali, current VC, Nasarawa State University who is also representing SONTA in this function as chairman SONTA Council of Trustees and Fellows. Professor Amali was chairman of the CHOGM planning committee for the opening ceremony in 2003 and immediate past VC of Unilorin. and Professor Charity Angya of Benue State University. We have institutional membership drawn from fourty-two universities, twelve polythecnics, seven colleges of Education, twenty-two Arts Councils and fifteen foreign affiliate professional institutions across five continents.
<br /><br />OUR SUGGESTIONS
<br />1. 
<br />The arts of the theatre: drama, dance and music are the potential high yielding revenue earners in addition to our mineral deposits.  What our Professional forebears started in this industry forty-five years ago has metamorphosed into a big industry we now know as Nollywood, the second largest film industry in the world. Nollywood is shaping the destiny of Africa as a whole. There is no where in Africa today that people are not talking about our drama, dance, music and film. Millions of naira are being made daily for Nigeria using our culture and creative talents,
<br /><br />The arts and culture of the nation  are the soul and spirit of that country. What Ngeria and Africa has to offer the world and has been offering the world which  remains unique to us is our arts and culture. Mr. President you have touched the right core as a scientist. You have not forgotten that in the scientist is the artist and in the artist is the scientist. The two compliment each another. Therefore, the greatest source of our wealth which remains largely untapped is our culture. Nigeria's dream of becoming one of the leading economies in 202020 can hardly be realised if the arts and cultural diamension to development are not properly catered for. The arts and entertainment are essential to the economy and socio-cultural well being of nations.  Mr President, your predecesors did their very best for the sector through the construction of national monument like the National Theatre in Lagos, introduction of NAFEST and Abuja Carnival. We are optimistic and hopeful that you will surpass their records by addressing the following crucial needs of our sector:
<br /><br />1
<br />NATIONAL THEATRE COMPLEX IN ABUJA
<br />We require a befitting national theatre in Abuja which can seat between five and ten thousand spectators. Such an edifice is our true symbols of national unity and pride as it is home to all irrespective of religion, ethnicity and social status.
<br /><br />2
<br />NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS
<br />Endowment for the arts is also urgently needed for researches, creativity and advancement of cultural diplomacy, development of languages and literature. we urge you to make the difference by urgently putting in place an endowment of the arts. The ripple effect this funding option will have on the creative industries in Nigeria can hardly be over emphasised. (employment opportunities in our industry cut across all strata of society from grassroot to glass top). All developed economies have long standing endowment of the Arts.
<br /><br />3
<br />THEATRE ARTS PROFESSIONALS REGULATORY BILL
<br />The growing popularity of the Noollywood industry and the renewed interest by your Government in repositioning Nigeria as a desirable tourist destination in Africa calls for urgent institution of a regulatory environment in which the interest, rights and responsibilities of the Nigerian Performing Artists are articulated, guaranteed and protected by a law. As is the practice globally, we need an enactment of the National Assembly which specifies minimum standards for all Professionals and stakeholders the culture industry. Unfortunately, for now there is no such law in existence. SONTA has commissioned the drafting of a world class bill title &quot;Theatre Arts Professionals Regulatory Bill&quot; this bill had gone throught the first and second reading in the floor of the Senate during the last session, unfortunately, the process was truncated. Mr President, SONTA invites you to take great interest in seeing to the timely passage of this bill after May 29th 2011. It is an enduring legacy you can bequet Nigeria and indeed the creative and entertinment industry!
<br /><br />4
<br />RELEASE OF THE REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL CULTURAL POLICY
<br /><br />As you are aware, the report of the review of the nigerian National Cultural Policy is still awaiting consideration and approval by government. As stakeholders, we urge you to make this also one of your priorities sir.
<br /><br />5. MAPPING OF THE NIGERIAN CULTURAL INDUSTRIES AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONSERVATORY FOR NIGERIAN THEATRE IN ABUJA
<br /><br />Mr President, the contributions of the creative/cultural industries to growth of the national economy in terms of employment generation, wealth creation and general social well being of Nigerians from time immemorial can not be overemphasized. However, there is difficulty in getting the required budgetary allocations from all tiers of government for the development of this sector. Part of the reasons for this has been lack of an empirical study to demonstrate the facts and figures accruing to the national economy through this sector. SONTA has decided to spearhead the first ever mapping of the creative and cultural industries in Nigeria to support government policies in this regard. We also hope that thereafter a conservatory will be built in Abuja to preserve the unique history and traditions of Nigerian theatre and works of other artists for posterity. Sir, SONTA will require your kind assistance for the allocation of a five hectares of land in Abuja for this purpose.
<br /><br />CONCLUSION
<br />The economy of the United States of America rides on its entertainment industry to remain the world's leader todate. Nigeria has greater portentials for growth and economic development through its entertainment industry than America. We need a leader who has the insight to unlock this sustainable, abundant, non oil revenue earner to achieve the much desired diversification of our economy. Mr President, you are that leader. We trust your sincerity. We salute your bold strides. We salute your intellectual wisdom and vision.
<br /><br />Thank you for your kind attention, our listening President!

<br /><br />(First published in The Guardian, August 19, 2011)
<br /><br />By Segun Ojewuyi
<br /><br />THE apex body of Theater academics in Nigerian Universities and Colleges of education - Society of Nigerian Theater Artists (SONTA), on Friday August 12, awarded its fourth ever Lifetime Distinguished Artist honor to Professor Charity Angya, Vice Chancellor of Benue State University in Makurdi. Led by Professor Shamsideen O.
<br /><br />Amali - Vice Chancellor of Nasarawa State University who himself is a highly respected Theater Scholar and the current Chairman of SONTA's Board of Trustees, the investiture was a remarkable touch of sophistication, where gravitas met with pomp.
<br /><br />In attendance was the Chief of Staff to the Benue State Governor - Professor Saint Gbileka (a Theater scholar himself) and the Secretary to the Benue State Government - Dr David Salifu. There was also a gallery of SONTA fellows - Professors Steve Oga Abah of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Ayo Akinwale - University of Ilorin, Jenks Okwonri - ABU and Professor Yisa from the University of Jos. The chief host of the investiture was SONTA's current President -Emma Dandaura, who is also head of the department of Theater and Cultural Studies, Nasarawa State University, Charity Angya is a 1987 doctoral graduate of Theater Arts from the University of Ibadan and with her appointment by the University's Board of Trustees, she now serves as the first-ever female Vice-Chancellor of Benue State University, Makurdi. A career that started at the University of Calabar, she has served Benue State University for many productive years as scholar of Theater and women studies, rising steadily as Professor, Head of Department of Theater Arts and Dean of the faculty of Arts among other positions. Along with Professor Amali, Angya becomes the second member of SONTA and the scholarly discipline of Theater in the Vice Chancellor's seat in the Nigerian University system. It was not too long ago that the same discipline produced Africa's first Professor of Theater in Professor Joel Adedeji (late) of the University of Ibadan and Africa's first Nobel Prize Winner for Literature in Professor Wole Soyinka who retired from the dramatic Arts department of the then University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University.
<br /><br />Over the years while other disciplines enjoyed strong support from their Universities, the field of Theater was always treated as an afterthought. Undaunted and as if driven by a vision beyond what the ordinary mind could comprehend, the discipline grew, first with the indigenous Theater Artists led by late Chief Hubert Ogunde. When the University of Ibadan opened its doors to the first academic department of Drama in Africa, building on the energies of the 1960 Masks, the Orisun Theater and the Mbari movement, the genie would no longer be contained.
<br /><br />The birth, rise and artistic success of the Nigerian Film industry today must be accorded the efforts of many Theater graduates whose training and post-university jobs were in the television and advertising industries as producers, directors, actors, cameramen, editors of drama and creative directors of television commercials. These graduates have also been found contributing pivotal productivity to the banks, journalism and even in national politics. No wonder that today there are thirty-three departments of theater /drama in Nigerian Higher Institutions as proudly noted by Emmanuel Dandaura - head of the department of Theater and Cultural Studies, Nasarawa State University. Dandaura who is the current president of SONTA, has brought some dynamism to the body, reaching out to the industry more actively. It is a new dispensation that might just bridge the untenable schism between the academics in SONTA and the practitioners in the Natiional Association of Nigerian Theater Arts Practitioners (NANTAP) - a body of professional Theater artists who are largely graduates of the Universities. The two organisations have over the years advocated the centrality of Theater and the dramatic art, to the socio-cultural development of our Nigerian nation. Dandaura's eloquence on the need for SONTA members to forge new communities across the wide borders of social interest, was therefore not misplaced. Theory after all, is borne of practice.
<br /><br />In his own presentation, Professor Amali underscored the great services that theater has brought to the people and government of Nigeria both at home and internationally. He pointed to the trans-nationality of the Theatrical arts - crossing the many borders of life, human experience, cultures and religion. Such versatility and immeasurable determination, he underscored, have been the outstanding qualities displayed by Professor Angya - the honoree, even as a young student at the University of Jos in the early 1980s, where he was her teacher and mentor.
<br /><br />The two states Benue and Nasarawa, border each other and do share some stunning similarities. These commonalities were appropriately scored by the presentations from the Benue State Arts Council and students from Nasarawa State University's department of Theater and Cultural studies. Professor Angya in her response promised her two communities, her renewed commitment to the highest levels of service. Professor Nancy Agbeh , Vice Chancellor of the University of Nkah was the Special guest for the event.

<br /><br />SONTA HONOURS AYAKOROMA
<br /><br />The highly distinguished award of the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artists (SONTA), the Life Time Achievement Award, has been conferred on the Executive Secretary of National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO), Dr. Barclays Foubiri Ayakoroma.
<br /><br />The award, which automatically added the ES into the SONTA Hall of Fame, was presented to him by the most respected theatre arts scholar, director and critic in Nigeria, Professor Dapo Adelugba, who was his lecturer at the postgraduate level in the University of Ibadan.
<br /><br />SONTA, the highest professional Association for all Theatre Lecturers, Academics and Theorists in Nigeria, conferred the award on Ayakoroma at the opening ceremony of its 24th Annual Conference at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, because of the cognate contributions he had made in the Arts and Culture sector in Nigeria and to the growth of SONTA.
<br /><br />The award was given to him alongside others, where many reputable Nigerian and international scholars as well as filmmakers were gathered for the conference with the theme: Nollywood and Theatre for Development (TfD): Exploring the Bridges of Interaction.
<br /><br />The National President of SONTA, Professor Emmanuel Dandaura, described Ayakoroma as a major factor and source of inspiration in the repositioning of SONTA, saying that he has also remained steadfast in the academic qualities SONTA is known for.

<br /><br />The Society of Nigerian Theatre Artists (SONTA), the umbrella body of theatre scholars in Nigeria, has told Federal Government to provide the enabling environment and equipment for technical aspects of film production in order to make an impact on the rising profile of film industry in Nigeria.
<br /><br />This call is coming as efforts are being made to bring the Film industry and Theatre for Development (TfD) together for a meaningful development in Nigeria.
<br /><br />The National President of SONTA, Professor Emmanuel Dandaura, who stated this at the opening ceremony of the 24th SONTA Annual Conference in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, said that to achieve this, the government needs to set up Centres for Excellence in the six geo-political zones of the country and tackle the problem of power generation, adding that the centres will be equipped with modern film production facilities.
<br /><br />Professor Dandaura noted that the Nigerian film industry, Nollywood, has registered a remarkable impact and cannot be neglected in the efforts at promoting Nigerian culture: “The truth is that Nollywood has contributed to the growth of Nigerian culture and economy. They should be given attention by the government. It has been managed by individuals and their activities are germane to the existence of Nigeria. It is on this ground I call on the Government to aid them in those areas that are capital intensive. The area of technical production needs equipment that individuals cannot afford. Government can provide this by building Centres for Excellence in the six geo-political zones. Then, experts in that area will manage them and train others. You can agree with me that the issue in Nollywood now is poor productions. But if a place to train those who handle the technical aspects is made available, there will be improvement. In terms of power, the moment it is tackled, then an enabling environment has been provided. This will help the film industry to join force with the theatre to development the country.”
<br /><br />The Vice-Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, in his speech, commended SONTA for the initiative of bringing film and TfD together in a conference, informing that the Department of Theatre and Performing Arts of the University started TfD in Nigeria.
<br /><br />He said: “TfD and film, especially Nollywood, are coming together for a dialogue. This is the first of its kind in Nigeria. I am happy that it is taking place in ABU. This is because TfD started in ABU. I welcome Michael Etherton, who came to this University in 1975, to establish Drama, for coming back to witness that the seed he sowed 34 years ago, is blossoming to this national and international level. I commend SONTA for the international level they are taking Nigerian theatre practice. I am also happy that University of Leeds is famous with African scholars, hence the presence of Professor Jane Plastow here. I commend those, who are making the film practice meaningful in Nigeria, and are present here.”
<br /><br />The event, which took place at the Assembly Hall of the Senate Building of ABU, had interesting lead paper presentations on TfD by Michael Etherton and on Nollywood by Professor Onookome Okome, a renowned film scholar from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.
<br /><br />The theme of the Conference is “Nollywood and Theatre for Development (TfD): Exploring the Bridges of Interaction,” and the Executive Secretary of the National Institute for Cultural Orientation, Dr. Barclays Foubiri Ayakoroma, is expected to present a paper on “Nollywood and Cultural Development: Milestones and Prospects for a Journey of the Future.”
<br /><br />For the first time, abstracts of papers by some members of staff of NICO have been accepted and the papers are billed to be presented at the conference, which is indicative of the setting of standards by the present leadership of the Institute. The papers are “Soyinka’s Theatre of Revolution: A Political Lesson for Nollywood” by Dr. Dipo Kalejaiye, “Nollywood: Has it Represented, Promoted, Propagated, and Developed Nigerian Culture” by Mr. Law Ikay Ezeh, and “Towards Theatre Criticism of Nigerian Film: A Study of Barclays Ayakoroma’s Nollywood Critical Standpoint” by Mr. Nwagbo Nnenyelike.
<br /><br />The conference lasts from 15th to 18th, November, 2011.

<br />on Thursday, 17 November 2011
<br /><br />Practitioners of Theatre for Development (TfD) have been advised to curt the partnership of stake holders in the Nigerian film industry, Nollywood, to broaden their vistas and effectively communicate with the populace.
<br /><br />This call came at a Round Table session at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, on Tuesday, November 15, 2011, at the 24th edition of the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artists (SONTA) Annual Conference, with the theme, “Nollywood and Theatre for Development (TfD): Exploring the Bridges of Interaction.”
<br /><br />Participants at the Round Table, which was moderated by the Executive Secretary of National Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO), Dr. Barclays Foubiri Ayakoroma, observed that it is possible for TfD and Nollywood practitioners to work together, and that for there to be a veritable synergy, those involved in TfD should initiate and sustain the collaboration, considering the fact that the Nigerian film industry is privately and commercially driven and will be the senior partner.
<br /><br />It was also observed that some Nollywood producers have actually dealt on issues of interest to TfD and that the platform could be further explored for such productions as part of their social responsibility without losing sight of the entertaining objective of the film medium.
<br /><br />Discussants at the Round Table, which Dr. Ayakoroma described as the best he had participated in the last five SONTA Annual Conferences, include, Mr. Michael Etherton, Professor Dapo Adelugba, Professor Emmanuel Dandaura, Professor Jane Plastow, Professor Onookome Okome, Professor Oga Steve Abah, Professor Jenks Okwori, Professor Ayo Akinwale, Professor Segun Ojewuyi, Mr. Emeke Mba (D-G, National Film and Video Censors Board), Mr. Mahmood Ali-Balogun, Mr. Obi Okoli, Dr. Tor Iorapuu, Dr. Alex Asigbo, Dr. Tracie Utoh-Ezeajugh,  Dr. Diran Ademiju-Bepo, Hajia Lantana Ahmed, Greg Mbajiorgu, and Arnold Udoka, among others.

<br />on the Nigerian Guardian. 4th December 2011
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenigeriandaily.com%2F2011%2F12%2F04%2Fthey-are-human-beings-too-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.thenigeriandaily.com/2011/12/04/they-are-human-beings-too-</a>—-hagher/
<br /><br />AS  we all know the nature of the knowledge we (Professors and academics) acquire is in the discipline that leads to the acquisition of truth, the discipline that leads us to know how to think.  I think that for each of us, the time has come that you must shine the truth wherever you are, let your light of truth shine.”
<br />With two-terms as a senator from Benue State,  two ministerial portfolios in two administrations,  two-tours of duty as Nigeria’s Ambassador to Mexico and now Canada, it would be hard to guess that he was once a puppeteer, a passionate Theater Scholar, famous for his groundbreaking study of the Kwagh-Hir Theater from his native Tiv.  Now he walks the grand stage of Global diplomacy and at SONTA’s (Society of Nigeria Theater Artists) 2011 conference at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher merged these variant persona and experiences into a fervent call for the defence of humanity, the role and responsibilities of Nigerian academics to the Nigerian nation and the power of culture in the sale of our collective national interests.  Hammering on the interface of intellectual honesty, cultural  integrity and  service to humanity, Prof. Hagher  urged the gathered congress of SONTA members and awardees:  “the time has come when you can no longer allow yourself to just be an invalid presence and not a voice.. It means the time has come when u can no longer stay in a community and watch people who should be defended, left unattended. You can no longer ignore their plight, stay silent and just walk away. Two  worlds are always combatting with each other.  The world  of those who are down trodden, who exist without the power to defend themselves and the world of those who seek to oppress them and keep people down.  The time has come for you to be the arbiter on the side of truth and justice in these worlds and wars.  For the down trodden you must speak, you must make your presence felt for them.  With them we share a common humanity.  They are human beings too!”
<br />SONTA’s conference two weeks ago (Nov. 15 – 17) had examined the opportunities for an interface between Theater for Development (TFD) and Nollywood.  Scholar Michael Etherton who led the practice of TFD at Ahmadu Bello University ABU some 32 years ago was back to give one of the two keynote lectures.  The other was by Prof. OnoOkome Okome of the University of Alberta, Canada who spoke on  Nollywood.  In their submissions they both recognized that while there are some synergies in thematic interests between Nollywood and Theater for Development, noting also that the roots of both are in Culture and performance, they are however incompatible. Perhaps TFD’s most outstanding achievement in Nigeria is in the scholarship and practice of Etherton’s distinguished products from the ABU Theater programme.  Among these are Prof. Steve Abah a SONTA Fellow who also  served as a Resource Person for the Presidency on Community Theatre and as a member of the World Bank-UNICEF-UNDP Committee on Poverty Alleviation; Filmmaker Segun Oyekunle of the Abuja Film Village International and of course, Ambassador Iyorwuese Hagher (Professor of Theater) who as a Federal Minister of Health deployed the efficacy of  drama and performance in the ministry’s campaign against the spread of HIV/AIDS.   This model continues to be in effective use today, even outside Nigeria.
<br /><br />The Conference attended by scholars from Theater institutions of higher learning from Nigeria and abroad, witnessed a presentation of over 60 academic papers and two roundtable sessions.  It also  honoured artists and academics, drawn from Nollywood and Theater.  Some of the honorees were Alex Chinwuba Asigbo, Barclays Foubiri Ayakoroma, Mahmood Ali-Balogun, Segun Oyekunle, Samuel Ayedime Kafewo, Saddik Balewa, Agbo Emmanuel Ogo-Ochi, and Julie Okoh.  The awards ceremony was chaired by the Vice Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University Prof. Mustapha Abdulahi, with Amb. Hagher as the special guest. Also present were Emeka Mba, DG of the Nigerian Film Censor’s Board; Prof.  Dapo Adelugba , Prof. Olu Obafemi – Director of Research and Studies at NIPSS Kuru and Prof. Jane Plastow from Leeds.
<br />With this parade of star academics and film industry professionals, one expected a much more vigorous and enriching examination of the conference theme, built around the interface between Nollywood and Theater for Development.  Though  Okome as usual strained to link Nollywood with the Onitsha market literature, underscoring Nollywood’s popular culture antecedents, he however was emphatic, and rightly so, on the need for scholars to stop laboring over how to tame Nollywood or make it come to dinner with such narrow confines of Theater for Development.  Okome Instead enjoined the gathering of  scholars to allow Nollywood grow by its own rules, its own successes and failures.
<br />As if echoing the same music, Etherton the Visiting Scholar and progenitor of TFD also warned that TFD should never hand itself over to the service of NGOs or become a political slogan, for it is theater first and last.
<br />Most of the presentations that followed were generally uninspiring, partly due to the strenuous theme of the conference in the first place and the natural dichotomies between film and live Theater.
<br />It was as if Iyorwuese Hagher was channeling these warnings and possibilities into a broader and more urgent call when he spoke on culture and values.
<br />“As professors, as academics, you know nothing yet.  You have overspecialised in a particular discipline.  As intellectuals we must examine our values.  There is truly no superiority between one culture and the other.  This means that if there are any values that come from the Western world we should imbibe them if they can add quality to our lives and society.  And we should reject them if  not.  Nigeria’s democracy cannot be a clone of any model of democracy in the world.  It must be our own invention, responding to the values of our culture and our experience. “
<br /><br />For me, I had gone in search of the bridges between Theater and Nollywood. It was also a reinvestment in the tradition of heated intellectual exchanges that marked the years of my apprenticeship when the divide was over ideologies, style and innovative competencies to move Theater forward.
<br />This conference, tucked in between a week of  a lacklustre National Festival of Arts, NAFEST in Calabar and the promise of a confused Abuja Calabar (with two management bodies who hardly agreed on anything) presented a mixed bag.  It was a package where academics tried on some glamour.  It was also a weekend where hope was renewed through the stimulating Theatrical performances from the students of ABU Drama.
<br />The Imprisonment of Obatala by Obotunde Ijimere and Katakata for Sufferhead by Oyekunle were stunning displays of good training and high talents, promising that in those students, live theater remains alive and enthralling.
<br />In sum, SONTA’s conference with Prof. Emmanuel Dandaura of Nasarawa State University at the helm, was an ennobling outing where Culture, Theater, Politics and style were synergized.
<br />As my journey moved on from Zaria to Minna, Niger State to participate in the “First MBA (Muazu Babangida Aliyu) National Literary Colloquium, led with the lecture by Odia Ofeimun  “Building Intellectual Power to Fix Nigeria” I couldn’t but wonder that perhaps, there is still some burning embers under this ash of decay and corruption engulfing our country.  The words of Prof. Hagher would continue to ring in my ears.
<br />“It is our collective responsibility to be the eyes of this nation. We must learn as scholars to give Nigeria a new sense of patriotism.  Our own lives must show integrity.  What we write as scholars, what we produce as artists, what we do as leaders must not be different from how we live our lives. We must be accountable to those who look p to us”

<br />Hausa Filmmakers Wants Fund Without Stiff Conditions&quot;
<br /><br />published by al-amin-ciroma in Published in his Weekly Kannywood column (in LEADERSHIP WEEKEND)
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F.blogspot.com%2F2011_06_01_archive.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://.blogspot.com/2011_06_01_archive.html</a>
<br /><br />In a bid to support the motion picture industry in Nigeria, President Goodluck Jonathan has reiterated his intention on how to chart a new road map for the creative industry as well staging a war on pirates in order to support hardworking Nigerian artistes reap from their sweat. This was part of the message delivered by the president when he hosted all Nigerian artistes, sportsmen and women at Eko Hotel, Lagos recently.
<br /><br />Other requests from the artistes to the president includes setting up of a film village, accessing the $200million intervention fund, setting up of endowment fund for the art, enacting regulatory bills and distribution network. 
<br /><br />President Jonathan, who said he did not call the artistes together because of the elections, called for the review of the existing laws on piracy, which he said, must be made effective to curb the nefarious activities of pirates in the creative industry. He noted that except the piracy problem is effectively tackled, the artistes’ community would not make any progress in the chosen career. 
<br /><br />“Totally, I agree that without handling piracy, we cannot make any progress. I believe some existing laws need to be made stronger and effective. We need a special body that can handle it,” he said. 
<br />He said the government has lots to gain if it supports the industry because the sector is a key one every President should identify with. He observed that the government is too far from the sector and that it needs to be closer to know what is happening in the industry. 
<br /><br />A brief presentation of the late reggae King, Bob Marley’s tune, Redemption song by West African idol star, Timi Dakolo was all the Senior Special Assistant to President Jonathan on Research Documentation and Strategy, Mr. Oronto Douglas needed to set the tone for the interaction that lasted till 11pm.
<br /><br />Douglas described the interaction as the first of its kind in any administration in the country. “This is the first president that will be calling on the masters of the creative industry for an interaction. And to have this session is to set an agenda for the future. Those in charge of laughter and happiness cannot be undermined…This is not the time to think regional or ethnic, but excellence. This sector must be supported so that Nigeria will grow,” he told stakeholders at the dinner. 
<br /><br />From veterans such as master visual artist, Bruce Onabrakpeya, film legend, Eddie Ugbomah, popular poet, Odia Ofeimun, juju singer, Dele Abiodun, lecturer and culture promoter, Emmanuel Dan Daura, multi-talented culture activist, Ben Tomoloju, seasoned producer, Zeb Ejiro, ageless actor, Olu Jacobs, to Nollywood and contemporary music as well as comedy stars such as Segun Arinze, Stephanie Okereke, Daddy Showkey, DBanj and Ali Baba, the hundreds of the industry players had tabled their fears before the president, who promised to take prompt action on their requests, especially if he returns to office after the April elections.
<br /><br />Others include the Kannywood team, led by Alhaji Sani Mu’azu, the National President, Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (MOPPAN), Ibrahim Sheme, founding member, Kaduna State Producers’ Association, Ahmed Alkanaway, administrative Secretary, MOPPAN and Sani Musa Danja, Chairman, Kano State Artiste Council, also the president of Nigerian Artiste in Support of Democracy (NAISOD). Others include: Yakubu Mohammed, famous movie director and host of Hausa film actors like Malam Isa Bello Ja, Hauwa Maina, Rahmatu Hassan, Ubale Wanke-wanke, etc. 
<br />Among other industry leaders, Mr. Bond Emeruwa called for prompt action on the revised Nigerian Film Policy which, according to him, is at the Ministry of Information; the President of Independent Television Producers Association of Nigeria, Busola Holloway, enjoined the President to check the trend in which production of choice commercials were being taken out of Nigeria while most production crew are being sourced from abroad. In specific terms, the producer of Moments with Mo, Mo Abudu urged Jonathan to upgrade the capacity and operations of the Nigerian Television Authority(NTA).
<br /><br />While the Vice President of the Association of Nigerian Authors, Sunny Ododo, called on the President to assist in the building of its proposed Writers’ Village in Abuja, President of the National Association of Nigerian Theatre Arts Practitioners, Greg Odutayo, revered producer, Amaka Igwe, among other requests, want the Presidency to make it possible for filmmakers to shoot films at public places such as the Aso Rock, the National Assembly and airports – without hindrances. 
<br /><br />Kannywood’s Sani Mu’azu, expressed the need to access the intervention fund without stiff conditions. Also, while the President of the Society of Nigerian Artists, Uwa Essien, called for the building of befitting exhibition halls, Onabrakpeya pleaded with Jonathan to make it possible for artists to display their works at strategic government offices whenever international programmes were being held there. 
<br /><br />Footballers such as JJ Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, Victor Ikpeba, Austin Eguavoen and Peter Rufai were also in attendance, with Eguavoen urging the president to look into some debts of promises the Federal Government owes players and the retirement dilemmas that sportsmen face. 
<br /><br />Thanking Jonathan on behalf of the artistes and investors in the sector, a former Minister of National Planning, Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi, commended him for what he described as the cerebral approach to life, which, according to Gbadamosi, Jonathan had cultivated for long. 
<br /><br />As several other speakers acknowledged at the dinner, the Special Adviser to the President on Research, Documentation and Strategy, Mr. Oronto Douglas, also noted that it was the first time any Nigerian President would sit down and talk with the entertainment workers. He assured them that the way Jonathan had kept his promise on power and electoral reforms, he would act on the various demands they had made.
<br />Some of the Kannywood stakeholders, who expressed their views on the intervention fund by the president, were of the opinion that the Jonathan-led government is the best that ever happened to Nigeria. They expressed their satisfaction with his government and pledged their support for his continuity. Sani Musa Danja, urged his colleagues in Kannywood as well as his teeming fans to see to the truth and support the Jonathan movement. 
<br /><br />“I am delighted with the support Mr. President is according the industry with this intervention fund, I was also impressed when he announced his intention in drawing the battle line between his government and the pirates, who, for decades have frustrated the hardworking artiste by pirating their works, leaving them with nothing. Therefore, I am calling on my fellow artistes in Kannywood and Nollywood as well as my fans and well-wishers, to support the continuity of this government, because it aims at rejuvenating this promising industry.”
