<br /><br />HOLLAND TOWNSHIP -- East Grand Rapids recreation director Fred Bunn was the overall winner of the first Lake Macatawa Duathlon.
<br />Saturday's event was intended as the 25th anniversary of the Lake Macatawa Triathlon, but cancellation of the swim portion because of bacteria in the water turned it to a running and biking competition.
<br />That was just fine for Bunn.
<br />“I don’t swim, and the change was good for me because running is my major background,” said Bunn, 48, who ran in the Olympic trials for the U.S. marathon team in 2000 and signed up for the Lake Macatawa event just last week.
<br />Bunn won with a time of 1 hour, 31 minutes, 27 seconds, about three minutes ahead of second-place finisher Greg Mueller of South Bend.
<br />The duathlon consisted of a 2-mile run, 22.8 miles of biking and ended with a 4.8-mile run. This year’s race attracted 240 athletes, about 10 more than last year’s field.
<br />Bunn said he paced himself against last year’s overall winner, Zeeland fifth-grade teacher Matt Smith.
<br />“I just tried to keep him in sight during the first run, get some time ahead on the bike and then hold the lead if I was ahead,” Bunn said.  
<br />Lisa Mueller, wife of Greg Mueller, was the top finisher among women with a time of 1:41:57.
<br />“My gameplan was to go hard and suffer,” said Mueller, 28, a member of the South Bend-based triathlon club Innovative Endurance, which is coached by her husband.
<br />She said her training schedule includes running, biking and swimming about 18 to 20 hours a week.
<br />Making up almost a quarter of the field was a triathlon training class from Grand Haven High School that had 57 entered in the race.
<br />“They get an 'A' if they finish the race and fail if they don’t, unless they get injured or sick on the course,” said Derek Warner, a Grand Haven High School physical education teacher who proposed and taught the first-time course. 
<br /><br />A total of 56 of 57 students finished the race, with one withdrawing in the final leg because of illness.
<br />“This was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do physically and mentally,” 10th-grader Maddie Cleghorn said.
<br />“Mr. Warren got us well prepared for the race. We’d do one day of biking, one day of running and one day of swimming, plus weight training,” said Cleghorn, who competed in her first triathlon/duathlon.
<br />Race director Darrin Duistermars said having to cancel the swim portion had event organizers scrambling to implement a new plan, but he noted, “it turned out to be an awesome race.”

<br /><br />The Internet has revolutionized the job search. Before the net, applications required a phone call and a face-to-face meeting; but with the rise of online job boards, an email or two containing a resume and cover letter can be all that separates you from your next job. A word of warning, however: Many dream jobs advertised online are just that imaginary. And you could be setting yourself up for a rude awakening.
<br />One of the victims of the said fraudulent expounds, “I had my own awakening one morning last summer. I applied to be an assistant teacher at a downtown Los Angeles school. The listing provided a link to another site where I filled in my personal information. I thought my data would only be used in the event the employer liked my resume, but the next day I received calls from a number in Scarsdale, N.Y. I reached a telemarketer who, instead of offering me an interview, advertised continuing education classes. I quickly realized that what I thought was a job was actually fancy dressing for spam. “This practice, known as “phishing,” is illegal, but is common online. Spammers will mine for personal information on the Internet while posing as a bank, an online store or an employer.
<br />According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, some 72,940 complaints of online fraud were received in 2008; 7.9 percent (or 5,762) of the total involved “confidence schemes,” which comprise job scams such as my own. Karen Hobbs, an attorney at the Federal Trade Commission, a government agency that investigates online fraud, warns that any job listing that advertises “easy money,” “guaranteed job placement” or an “upfront fee” could be job fraud. These schemes could offer licensing or accreditation, but charge a fee for “training,” and then offer a phony license and no job prospects. Moreover, other schemes take the form of “secret shopper” fraud; a company or person will wire you a check, ask you to deposit it immediately, and — before the check can bounce — ask you to wire your money into their account.
<br />Micron Associates advises against offering too much personal information. For example, don’t offer date of birth or driver’s license number. Try to research the position and the company as long as the job is not confidential as much as possible if there is something that sounds like they are trying to hide something, they probably are. You should also never pay upfront fees. Employers pay those fees — people don’t pay those fees.” Her advice is to “see these people in person. Don’t pay anything or wire money without seeing someone.” “Deal locally with folks you can meet in person,” and it is sound. Always be wary of anyone offering employment from out of state. Fraudsters think they can get away with anything because they are anonymous; do not allow them that luxury.If you are caught in a job scam, the best practice is to first contact a host of agencies that can help you deal with the problem. These include the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, the Better Business Bureau, the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection and the National Consumers League Fraud Center. You can also get in touch with your local and state police; the more people you inform of your fraud, the more likely you are to find help.
<br />There are steps to protect your money during the ordeal. Dependent on the information, cancel your credit card, change your bank account number. Consumers can also put a fraud alert on their credit report.” The fraud alert puts a hold on the account so money cannot be instantly deducted. Although the Internet offers a great deal of anonymity, scammers can be caught and brought to justice. Be careful with whom you deal, especially those people who offer everything but reveal nothing. Their setup is oftentimes smoking and mirrors. Do not be drawn in, and stay with the safe bet before giving in to the promise of wealth.
<br />Micron Associates Tips
<br /> •Be wary of sharing personal information. Your address, date of birth and social security number are not necessary for most job applications. Do not offer this information up front.
<br /> •Meet the recruiter in person. It is always a better idea to meet a potential employer in person before accepting a job. If the recruiter says it isn’t possible, then you know there’s something amiss going on.
<br /> •Do not pay them.Scammers will often guarantee a job after you pay money for training or access to a database. Do not be fooled. If this is a job advertisement and they are not offering you a job, then this is not a legitimate listing.
<br /> •Always research the job ahead of time. Look at the company’s web presence. If it has none, then caution should be used as you continue the application process. The Better Business Bureau is a good place to start your research.
<br /> •Act locally. The best way to avoid an online job scam is to know the identity of your future employer. Most scams happen through out-of-state companies. If you must apply in another state, be careful and always use caution. Remember, a little research goes a long way to determine if this is legitimate.

<br /><br />European ministers were set to grant Spain an extra year to reach its deficit targets in exchange for further budget savings but remained far from pinning down details of bank rescues and emergency bond-buying that are of greater concern to markets.
<br />On Monday, a top European Central Bank policymaker said that 17-nation currency area’s debt crisis was now more acute than the financial turmoil happened in 2008 that felled U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, as finance ministers of the euro zone met in Brussels.
<br />The ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet told to a conference in Lisbon, “”The euro zone crisis is now much more profound and more fundamental than at the time of Lehman.”
<br />Eurogroup finance ministers were tasked with fleshing out a bare-bones agreement reached by EU leaders at a summit last month on establishing a European banking supervisor and using the bloc’s rescue funds to stabilize bond markets. However, with differences persisting between north European countries such as Finland and the Netherlands and southern states led by Italy and Spain, EU officials said no breakthroughs were likely this week.
<br />German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble sought to defuse growing opposition at home by saying it would take time to establish a European bank supervisor and only once it was fully in place might ministers decide to allow direct recapitalization of ailing banks by the euro zone’s rescue fund.
<br />Schaeuble said he expected ministers to agree on a timetable for up to 100 billion euros ($123 billion) in aid for debt-stricken Spanish lenders.
<br />The ministers did agree to nominate Luxembourg central bank chief Yves Mersch for a seat on the ECB’s six-member executive board, which has been vacant since Spain’s Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo’s term ended in May.
<br />A wider gathering of EU finance chiefs on Tuesday is set to ease a deficit reduction goal that has forced Madrid to make punishing cuts that are exacerbating a recession.
<br />Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos was to spell out to finance ministers his government’s plan for a package of up to 30 billion euros over several years through spending cuts and tax hikes that are due to be announced this Wednesday.
<br />Furthermore, Spanish and Italian borrowing costs continued to rise on Monday, with Spain’s 10-year bond topping the critical 7 percent level, and world shares fell with a darkening global growth outlook and little prospect of early process on the euro zone’s debt crisis.
<br />A source close to the Spanish government said 10 billion euros of cuts would come this year and that the measures would include a hike in VAT sales tax, reduced social security payments, reduced unemployment benefits and changes to pension’s calculations. 
<br />In return, the European Commission will propose easing Madrid’s deficit goal for this year to 6.3 percent of economic output, 4.5 percent for 2013 and 2.8 percent for 2014, officials said.
<br />Based from the drafts recommendation from the European countries to Spain, the new targets may still prove difficult to reach, loosening its goals and demands the country be subjected to three-monthly checks.
<br />The figures highlighted Spain’s dramatic fiscal slippage due to a worsening recession. Madrid was originally meant to cut its budget shortfall to 4.4 percent this year. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy unilaterally changed the target to 5.8 percent in March before eventually accepting an agreed goal of 5.3 percent.
<br />The Commission will make the new proposal on Tuesday to the EU’s finance ministers, who would have to agree for the targets to become binding, two officials told Reuters.
<br />Madrid had been due to reduce its national deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2013. But a deep recession has put that beyond reach.
<br />De Guindos said he hoped to reach agreement on a memorandum of understanding on the bank rescue on Monday, which would be followed on July 20 by a final loan agreement. As part of that, Spain will create a single bad bank to house toxic assets from its banking sector.
<br />Spain and Italy again stepped up pleas for European action to put a cap on their borrowing costs.
<br />“At this moment the only institution that has enough money to act is the ECB,” Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said at a conference. “For that reason, the ECB should intervene in markets; it should start massive purchases of public debt so that speculators understand that they will lose their bets against the euro.”
<br />But Bradley Associates quoted “ECB President Draghi told EU lawmakers the key to restoring market confidence was for countries in difficulty to fully implement promised structural reforms and stick to programmers agreed with Brussels and international lenders, even if they caused “social tensions.”
<br />He left the door open to a possible further cut in interest rates after last week’s 25 basis point cut to 0.75 percent but voiced concern that the ECB was being expected to act “in areas which don’t seem to have a connection with monetary policy’s traditional remit”.

<br /><br />'I strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I’m back'
<br />Steven Tyler has decided to leave his role as a judge on American Idol after just two years, the Aerosmith frontman said today.
<br />&quot;After some long, hard thoughts, I've decided it's time for me to let go of my mistress American Idol before she boils my rabbit,&quot; Tyler said in a statement. &quot;I strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I'm back – but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I got two fists in the air and I'm kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass – the ultimate in auditory takeover.
<br />&quot;Idol was over the top fun, and I loved every minute of it,&quot; Tyler added. &quot;Now it's time to bring rock back.&quot;
<br />Tyler's decision comes in the middle of Aerosmith's current Global Warming Tour with openers Cheap Trick. The North American trek finds them gearing up for the planned November 6th release of Music From Another Dimension, the band's first studio album since 2004. The group debuted the record's first single, &quot;Legendary Child,&quot; during Idol's season finale this year.
<br />&quot;He's been a terrific judge, a true friend and great mentor to everyone involved with the show, and we know he'll continue to be a huge inspiration to Idol hopefuls for years to come,&quot; said Mike Darnell, President of Alternative Entertainment at Fox. &quot;We are very sad that Steven has chosen to focus more on his music, but we always knew when we hired a rock &amp; roll legend, he would go back to the music.&quot; 
<br />Added Simon Fuller, the show's co-creator and executive producer, &quot;Steven Tyler is a real 'Idol,' a rock legend. If you had told me 10 years ago he would be a judge on American Idol, I would have thought it impossible. The fact that this became a reality and we had the pleasure of him gracing our stage for two seasons makes me very proud. I completely understand his desire to get back to his life as the singer in America's greatest-ever rock band.&quot;
<br />Tyler's announcement isn't the only thing to signal a shakeup at the Idol judges' table: Recently Jennifer Lopez told Today, &quot;I am thinking that maybe it's time for me to go and do other things that I really love to do, like films. Right now I'm on tour and performing.&quot;

<br /><br />Aerosmith frontman praises Hugh Hefner, talks new album
<br />Steven Tyler poses with Playboy Bunnies at the 15th anniversary of Rock 'N' Roll Fantasy Camp at The Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills
<br />Steven Tyler walked up the driveway to the entrance of the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles like it was a second home. Surrounded by a large entourage as he was led to the red carpet, Tyler stopped to bare a Cheshire Cat's grin as he looked at the four lovely Playboy Bunnies waiting to pose for pictures with him. The rock star and the equally iconic home that has hosted thousands of parties seemed made for each other, but this was Tyler's first visit ever to the Holmby Hills grounds.
<br />How was that possible that in all the years of Aerosmith's success, the frontman had never been to one of the famous Halloween parties or a Midsummer Night's Dream? &quot;I was too busy in someone’s bathroom getting high,&quot; Tyler told Rolling Stone. &quot;I was too busy on tour, I was too busy writing songs. We were just busy.&quot;
<br />While he had never been to the house that Hef built, Tyler has crossed paths with the famed Lothario, Hugh Hefner. And Tyler is a big fan. &quot;I love people that are committed to their crimes of passion and he is the gentleman of all time,&quot; Tyler told us. &quot;He’s been on every man’s mind around the world at least a hundred times in their lifetime for what he did. So he signifies the joys of womanhood and not the degradation . . . and even women love Playboy.&quot;
<br />What finally brought Tyler to the mansion after more than 40 years in the spotlight was Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp, a program that allows people to live out their rock &amp; roll dreams and spend four intense days training with counselors to play with Tyler or other superstars, such as Kiss' Gene Simmons, who will be the headliner at an upcoming event in Las Vegas from October 10th through 14th.
<br />Tyler got involved with the camp last year through Mark Hudson, a counselor in the program who co-wrote Aerosmith's &quot;Livin' On The Edge.&quot; &quot;We spoke last year, I was doing a book, and they asked me here and I said I would, and I spoke in front of the whole camp. It’s called just being a mentor, if not to incite a riot,&quot; he says.
<br />Tyler had a challenge for this week's campers, who joined him on stage at the mansion last night. &quot;I just dared them all to learn an Aerosmith song to see how good they can do it,&quot; he says. &quot;If they do it good, which I’m sure they will, I’m gonna pick the best group of them all, we’re gonna pick straws and the best one out of that gets to ride around in my car and hear the new Aerosmith album.&quot;
<br />When Tyler says, while speaking of the upcoming record, &quot;I’m on fire, as you can tell,&quot; he is not exaggerating. Despite being pulled away by several handlers, he doesn't want to stop talking about the new music, which is now in the mixing stages. &quot;It’s one of the best Aerosmith albums ever,&quot; he says. &quot;I’m one of the worst judges of my own music because I’m very harsh, highly critical. [But] we waited until we had at least four really good songs that were representative and we got 19.&quot;

<br /><br />We prefer start-up companies as they offer excellent returns on growth with less risk than seed stage companies. 
<br /><br />What We Look For 
<br /><br />By targeting these companies we have achieved some excellent returns on our investments. Throughout the years startup and middle market companies have exceeded our expectations. 
<br /><br />Occasionally we do invest in seed-stage companies who are looking for investments of up to $5 million if the company shows potential. 
<br /><br />Industry Potential 
<br /><br />In any investment we undertake, it is important that there is the right amount of investment potential. As a rule, we like to look at companies with mass market products, healthcare technology, green energy, patented technologies and IT solutions. 
<br /><br />We like to see a strong board of directors and management team along with a strong brand. We examine the company to see what the potential is to take the company into a global market to become market leaders 
<br /><br />We look at the structure of the company and assess whether it can rapidly scale up to fulfill accelerated growth. If we feel there are weak spots in a corporation that is restraining its growth, we can then provide the skill and talent to help the company to achieve its potential. 
<br /><br />Adding Value 
<br /><br />We understand that to add value to a company we need to create tangible assets in which you can assign a value. In each company we partner with we undertake the following: 
<br /><br />Operations - We help systematise operations to ensure everything runs smoothly and efficiently. We measure each stage of operations so the management team can identify weaknesses and act to ensure best operations performance. By doing this, we not only improve growth capacity but also form an operation that works in harmony. 
<br />New Markets - Some of the best growth opportunities are found by targeting new emerging markets. Asia has been and is one of the most important emerging markets today. Over the last decade, we have dedicated a division in our company just to build and form relationships in the Asian market. We have one of the strongest partnership networks in Asia. This is becoming one of the fastest growing areas in our company providing some exciting opportunities for our clients. 
<br /><br />Partnership With Management 
<br /><br />It is important that companies that we partner have a strong management team; this is the key to the success of all companies that we partner. When we partner a team we like to ensure that everyone involved have an interest in what the aims are, we do this by structuring equity reward schemes that represent the talent and responsibility of the management team member. The aim of offering equity in the company is to ensure that the management teams are focused and want success for the company. 
<br /><br />We work with the CEO of each of our portfolio companies to decide the best equity distribution plan, it will be the CEO’s responsibility to execute the plan by allocating the equity among his team. 
<br /><br />Process 
<br /><br />Working with the CEO - We believe in working closely with the CEO of our portfolio companies, if needed we may even put one of our members into a company to assist the CEO. This will only happen if the CEO is busy and really needs help with any legal, banking, or negotiation issues. 
<br /><br />It is important to understand that we are not there to undermine the CEO, it is just that sometimes the CEO can be busy with issues outside of the scope of his management team. 
<br /><br />Due Diligence 
<br /><br />Due diligence happens before any investment. This will involve an in-depth consultation with the CEO and his management team. We take a look at the current finances of the company along with all future projections. The time allowed for the due diligence process will depend on the company and the size of investment required.

<br /><br />When the Summer Olympics roll around, you can count on some intense competition in key events like gymnastics. But for 2012, the action isn’t just on the mat. It seems that distributing and battling malware and phishing efforts disguised as Olympics apps and info are practically an exhibition sport this summer.
<br />An app called “London Olympics Widget” seems harmless enough, but according to Bradley Webroot’s security blog, it actually rifles through your contacts, device info, and text messages.
<br />It’s no longer available via the Google Play store, but it’s still listed on an Australian site aggregating Android apps, where there are plenty of the telltale signs of skeezy code, including this odd Gmail contact address and English grammar that’s not quite right.Other bits of evidence suggest the app isn’t what it appears to be it’s digitally signed from New Delhi, and its own screenshots reveal that, well, it’s a pretty lame-looking widget.
<br />GFI Software also claims to have found Russian servers hosting sites posing as legit app stores to push out the nasty code to unsuspecting Android devices, making the former Soviet republic competitive in both the medal and malware count this year.
<br />Hijacking Olympics fever for fits of digital nastiness didn’t originate with the 2012 Games, but using Android as the major vehicle for such efforts may have. Back in 2008, when the Games were in Beijing, more than a dozen different Trojan horses were spotted attached to e-mails with subject lines like “The Beijing 2008 Torch Relay.”
<br />Those e-mail attacks are back for the London Games as well, and if you’ve been duped in the process of obsessively tracking the medal count, there’s a removal tool now available.
<br />Bradley Associates also has this helpful list of some of the Olympics-related threats seen this summer. It’s a handy reference to check before you click.
<br />You’ve been warned, Olympics fans. Now let’s get back to the Games. But just remember — there’s no place for Trojan horses in water polo.

<br /><br />Barcelona is a continually busy hub of activity and features one of the busiest seaports in Western Europe, excellent restaurants, many architectural landmarks, and top brand name fashion shops. It’s also a terrific vacation destination for families traveling with children due to the many notable theme parks located in the city. The Tyler Group listed the top theme parks in Barcelona for your consideration when vacationing there.
<br />Big Fun – located on the Centre Comercial Maremagnum’s second floor, this is one of Barcelona’s most famous and well-known theme parks. The latest novelties and technology associated with the video game world can be found here as well as what many consider an overwhelming assortment of fair games. There is a separate play area for children only where they can have fun climbing up, jumping, and sliding down to their heart’s content. If they just want to play around with a bunch of plastic balls, they can do that, too.
<br />Caribe Aquatic and Port Aventura Park – if you want to experience a great family day out just playing and having fun, this is the place. Whether your preference is a thorough drenching on one of the many water rides or a heart-pounding ride on one of the numerous roller coasters, Spain’s most popular theme park is just the ticket. You can even listen to reggae music while relaxing in the sunshine if that is what you choose to do.
<br />Isla de Fantasia – one of the most superbly designed and engineered aquatic theme parks offers a large variety of aquatic attractions such as 9 bars and restaurants, free buffet service, macro swimming pools, and much more.

<br />Tibidabo Amusement Park – this is one of Barcelona’s most famous theme parks and a favorite tourist destination as well as a popular attraction for the locals. The park probably sees more visitors in a year than what the population of the city is. The major attractions of the park include the Big Dipper, the Blue Tram, the Castle of Terror, and the Funicular. However, without a doubt, the Tibidabo Amusement Park crown jewel is the Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart.
