<br />26.7cm x 7.6cm
<br />and
<br />3D 17.8cm x 4.8cm
<br />3D 23.3cm x 6.7cm
<br />They will write the size in the description, this is to help you buy a suitable item, must not ignore it, if some online shops do not give this specific data, you should ask to the seller in detail, and it is better to buy these from the shop which has specific description. 
<br />Besides the size, you should take a look other information carefully too, such as the material and other features, in this shop, I find a useful installation guideline, someone intends to install the brake caliper, can take a reference:
<br />1. First remove your wheels and clean your original calipers 
<br />2. Then put some glue onto your new brake calipers, and stick them to your factory calipers
<br />3. Adapt the caliper cover kit to the suitable position and fix it with temporary paper tape

<br />5. Wait all the glue is dried
<br />6. Install your wheel, clean and beauty your new look brake caliper
<br />7. Protect them well, clean the dust regularly, and check if they are installed tightly if necessary
<br />Refers to the colors, I think it depends on the interest of everyone, here I will list the significance of some colors, and I am sure you will choose the color you really like to represent your personality: normally, there are five colors for you to choose: Black, Blue, Red, Silver, Yellow. Every color has its special effect. Black makes your car deep and mysterious, blue makes your car elegant and romantic, red makes you car excited, silver makes your car noble and peaceful, yellow will has the effect of brightness and hope.
