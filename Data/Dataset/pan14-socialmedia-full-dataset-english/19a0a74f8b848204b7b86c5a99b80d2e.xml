<br /><br />The unemployment rate in Singapore country is about 2.2% in March 2010 (source: Ministry of Manpower). The HDB supply physical shortage is could be quite difficult to balance when the Singapore government is issuing lands. The country is still experiencing shortage of HDB supply. The abrupt downwards spiraling of costs may not affect the buyers as long asprivate housing buyers provide reasonable prices and do not overbid. The best approach is for the property buyers to bid within the median of the property prices in Singapore to be strongly competitive. Though this may not apply to highly priced improvements or constructions that show more heavier swings, this is good enough to keep up with the competition in cases of low HDB supply.
<br /><br />HIGH END MARKET versus Mass Market
<br /><br />The high-end market could still retain a low HDB supply scenario with the potential to appreciate its value including the properties located near the location of the high-end property. They would elevate too whenever the high-end properties near their location raise their market value. Properties with characteristics related to the best locations across the globe will have a price benchmark equivalent or very much the same to the internationally known best properties in other known locations. Distinctive attributes such as the Yacht Berthing, sea view, special butler service, near to exclusive resorts, within town and financial centers, centers of entertainment or other activities could help increase the worth of the property.

Last 2008, the average earnings was about $3,977 per person. Last year, the average earnings per particular person was $3,872. Supposing that both spouses are holding a job in a certain family unit, the average earnings would be an estimated $8,000 per family. Looking at the following household features:
<br /><br />• average husband and wife family cash flow of $8000 (with no present debts)
<br />• 30 years housing loan tenor
<br />• ratio for debt servicing of 50%
<br />• interest rates set at 2%
<br /><br />The estimated greatest <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Byb3BlcnR5YnV5ZXIuY29tLnNnLw__" target="_blank">real estate property</a>   price that a family unit or a couple could have the funds for is about $1.082m. This would mean that the average household in Singapore could very well pay for a real estate property valued at $1.35m. Even so, like most loan accounts or borrowings, there is the problem on raising a part of the equity to serve as down payment. The best tactic is to find the lowest interest rate among the aggressive banks in Singapore offering this kind of products.
<br /><br />The rate of interest setting among conservative banks in Singapore is typically at the level of 3.75%. This lessens the loan borrowings to about $863,000 loan size. The computation of the salary and the rates of interest data for loan borrowings demonstrates the average household in the country of Singapore could only pay worth $1.08m of real estate property.
<br /><br />Rich business men and ministers contributed to the rise of the salary levels. This movement lead to a big gap among the highest and lowest salaries, which generated the mean salaries of the nation a little lower. In 2009, the average household earnings was $4,850 as stated by the Singstat (Singstat, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.singstat.gov.sg%2Fnews%2Fnews%2Fop19022010.pdf"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/op19022010.pdf</a> ). If the median incomes were sorted by type of property, the ultimate result would be a household income of $12,500 for private flats, private residences, and condominiums (Singstat, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.singstat.gov.sg%2Fnews%2Fnews%2Fop19022010.pdf"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.singstat.gov.sg/news/news/op19022010.pdf</a>)
<br /><br />The computation for the mean household income in Singapore country is as follows:
<br /><br />Average income per person as of 2010 = $4,000
<br />No. of persons in a household = 2 (couple)
<br />Average household pay = 2 x average income per person
<br />Average household pay = 2 x $4,000
<br />Average household pay = $8,000 as of June 15, 2010
<br /><br />The final result provides us an idea on the existence of significant difference in earnings within Singapore. Most private condominium owners have a household earnings of $12,500. If we lower the prices for private condominium to the average household income of the Singapore population, which is $8,000, this would create a difference scenario for the real estate industry.
