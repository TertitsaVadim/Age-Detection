Simply set up one or more signatures and have them automatically appear on every email. You can format them and add in images which looks professional, and saves you time.<br /><br />2) Quick Parts - These are predefined objects, including images, or text that you can insert into an email with a few clicks of your mouse. Use them for answering FAQ's or any other information you find you type out over and over again.<br /><br />3) Folders - Reduce clutter in your inbox by organising your messages into folders. Be careful not to go overboard with the number of folders you set up as this may mean you spend too much time debating with yourself over which folder to put the message into. Instead use the advanced search tool  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  to quickly find what you're after.<br /><br />4) Rules - You can set up rules to have Outlook automatically colour code emails based on who they're from, who they're sent to, or even what the subject is. Rules can automatically file your emails into folders, or even better, forward emails to someone else for action without having to lift a finger.<br /><br />5) Search Folders - Do you file your messages by task, but sometimes do a search to find all messages relating to a particular client? If you find you're performing the same search regularly you can save time by setting up a search folder, then when you want to do the search simply open the folder and it updates automatically with one click.<br /><br />6) Get Organised - Categories allow you to group like messages so you can search, sort and find all messages that are related to a particular category. For example, you might have a category for a project or job, or even a client. You can set up categories any way you choose. Flags allow you to set reminders to revisit a message or level of importance. You can use flags and categories to quickly sort and filter your emails.<br /><br />7) Tasks - Tasks are an electronic To-Do list. You can assign tasks to others, set reminders and keep track of progress <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  is great.<br /><br />8) Recurring Events - Never forget a birthday or anniversary again. Set a recurring even in your Outlook calendar for recurring events that occur regularly. And give yourself time to take action by setting your reminder in advance.<br /><br />9) Collaborate - Have someone else manage your calendar by delegating permission to view and or edit you calendar.<br /><br />10) Journal - The journal allows you to collate information about a task or contact by appending documents like Word and Excel files. Plus keep track of communication with a contact like email, phone calls and more.<br /><br />If you're serious about improving your productivity these Microsoft Outlook tools are a must learn.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  is available in various levels of quality, and with most people being visual, video tutorials are by far the easiest to follow.

To look at it, you need to open it in the appropriate program. At least, that was the situation prior to Outlook 2007.<br /><br />The ability to 'take a peek' at a file attached to a message is one of the simple and convenient benefits of upgrading to Outlook 2007. When I say you can take a peek at an attachment, I mean that you have the ability to preview attachments inside of the Outlook Reading Pane, without having to use the program the attached file is normally used with.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br /><br />You send me a Word document attached to an email. In the past, I would have to launch Word to see the attachment. Now, I can preview the contents of the document right inside Outlook without having to start Word.<br /><br />That's a lot faster and more convenient than the old approach. The same attachment previewing capability is there for Excel spreadsheets and several other kinds of files that people often email back and forth. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  seeing the same poor standards support as 2007. <br /><br />In Praise of Attachment Previewers<br /><br />If you're wondering how you can preview attachments without using the programs the attachments work with, there's a simple explanation. Outlook 2007 comes with a set of attachment previewers, little add-in programs that plug right into Outlook 2007 and give it the ability to display a basic view of the contents of a file.<br /><br />Now remember that attachment previewers aren't full versions of Word, PowerPoint or whatever. They don't give you the ability to edit attached files in Outlook. For that matter, they don't guarantee that they will show the contents of the attachment in exactly the same format they would if you viewed them using their native program.<br /><br />What they do accomplish is making it easy for you to take a look at the contents of the attached file without breaking your Outlook stride. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  has new features to help you organize your emails more effectively.<br /><br />Outlook 2007 comes with attachment previewers for major Microsoft Office files, plus previewers for common image and text file types. And some other companies have also created attachment previewers for their own file types that you can download.<br /><br />This means that for most of the attachments you're likely to receive, you should already have, or be able to download, an attachment previewer that will let you preview that attachment type.<br /><br />Once the attachment previewer you need is installed, using it is simple. When you have a message containing an attachment visible in the Reading Pane, Outlook displays a set of buttons at the top of the pane.<br /><br />The Message button shows you the body of the message when you click it. In addition to the Message button, each attachment gets its own button. These buttons are labeled with the name of the attached file. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.outlook-downloads.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.outlook-downloads.com/</a>  helps you communicate with important contacts.<br /><br />The button you click determines what appears in the Reading Pane. Click Message to see the body of the email message. Click an attachment's button to get a preview of the attachment.<br /><br />It's all nice and easy, but you remember that the attachment preview isn't guaranteed to look exactly the same as the file would look if you opened it with the program it works with (a Word document in Word, for example). This means you don't want to do things like approve a final document or proof an ad based on what an attachment previewer shows you.<br /><br />Even so, if you get lots of messages with attached files, you will surely find that installing and using the relevant attachment previewers will make your life with Outlook 2007 a lot easier.
