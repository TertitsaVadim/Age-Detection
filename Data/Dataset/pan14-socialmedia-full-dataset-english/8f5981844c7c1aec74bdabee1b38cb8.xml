On a cardboard sign, next to an empty tin cup, he had written: &quot;Blind - Please help&quot;. No one was giving him any money.
<br /><br />A young advertising writer walked past and saw the blind man with the sign an the empty cup, and also saw the many people passing by completely unmoved of his situation, let alone stopping to to give him money.
<br /><br />The advertising writer took a thick marker-pen from her pocket, turned the cardboard sheet back-to-front, and re-wrote the sign, then went on her way.  Immediately, people began putting money into the tin cup.
<br /><br />After a while, when the cup was overflowing, the blind man asked a stranger to tell him what the sign now said.  &quot;It says&quot;, said the stranger, &quot;It's a beautiful day.  You can see it.  I cannot.&quot;
<br /><br />(This old time story illustrates in a very powerful way how important the choice of words and language is when we want to truly connect with or move other people.)

Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be useful only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
<br />People need a broad range of skills in order to contribute to a modern economy and take their place in the technological society of the 21st century. A joint American Society for Training and Development and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it. And these skills are:
<br /><br />1.  Learning to learn: Learning is an integral part of everyday life. The skill of knowing how to learn is a must for everybody and is the key to acquiring new skills and sharpening the ability to think through problems. It opens the door to other learning. Study smarter - not harder. A secondary benefit of learning how to learn is that it empowers the learner's ability to develop a measurable task repeatedly.
<br /><br />2.  Foundation skills: From the employer's perspective, the skill of knowing how to learn is cost-effective because it can mitigate the cost of retraining efforts. When workers use efficient learning strategies, they absorb and apply training more quickly, saving their employers money and time. When properly prepared, employees can use learning-to-learn techniques to distinguish between essential and nonessential information, discern patterns in information, and pinpoint the actions necessary to improve job performance. Many employers - particularly those dealing with rapid technological change see the learning-to-learn skill as an urgent necessity. Productivity, innovation, and competitiveness all depend on developing the workers' learning capability. Machinery and processes are transferable between companies and countries, but it is the application of human knowledge to technology and systems that provides the competitive edge.
<br /><br />3.  Basic skills competence: The inability of large numbers of new workers to meet reading, writing, or computational (simple mathematics) standards is an economic and competitive issue. This forces employers to spend more on these critical competence skills. The majority of workers are literate and numerate but frequently, cannot use these skills effectively because they are rusty when called upon to use mathematical principles they have not used for 20 years, because they must use the skills in a context different from the one in which they originally learned them, or because they do not understand how to expand or apply the skill.
<br /><br />4.  Reading: Reading has historically been considered the fundamental vocational skill for a person to get, keep, get ahead, or to change jobs. One educational assessment by Kirsch and Jungeblut in 1986, indicates that there is a large nationwide population of intermediate literates who only have fourth to eighth grade literacy equivalency (but are high school graduates) and who have not obtained a functional or employable literacy level.
<br /><br />5.  Writing: Writing is consistently ranked among the highest priorities for job applicants and employees. One study states that more than 50 percent of the business respondents identified writing skill deficiencies in secretarial, skilled, managerial, supervisory, and bookkeeping personnel.
<br /><br />6.  Computation: Because of technology, simple mathematical computation is important as employers focus on an employee's ability to compute at higher levels of sophistication. The introduction of sophisticated management and quality control approaches demand higher mathematical skills. Ironically, as occupational skill-level requirements climb, higher educational dropout rates and worsening worker deficiencies in computational skills are appearing (Brock, 1987; Kirsch and Jungeblut, 1986; Semerad, 1987). Employers complain particularly about miscalculations of decimals and fractions, resulting in expensive production errors. Employees must calculate correctly to conduct inventories, complete accurate reports of production levels, measure machine parts or specifications so that medium-to-high levels of mathematics skills are required across job categories. The business effect of math skill deficiencies is bottom line losses.
<br /><br />7.  Communication skills:Formal education in communication has been directed at reading and writing skills that are used least in the workplace. Most have only one or two years in speech related courses and no formal training in listening. Workers who can express their ideas orally and who understands verbal instructions make fewer mistakes, adjust more easily to change, and more readily absorb new ideas than those who do not. Thus career development is enhanced by training in oral communication and listening because these skills contribute to an employee's success in all of the following areas: interviewing, making presentations at or conducting meetings; negotiating and resolving conflict; selling; leading; being assertive; teaching or coaching others; working in a team; giving supervisors feedback about conversations with customers; and retraining. Employees spend most of the day communicating, and the time they spend will increase as robots, computers, and other machines take over mundane, repetitive jobs.
<br /><br />8.  Oral: Skill in oral communication is a key element of good customer service. More than 76 million workers (in the USA) are in the service sector and companies that provide excellent service tend to stay far ahead of their competitors. To provide good service, all employees (not just designated sales and marketing employees) must learn how to talk and listen to customers, handle complaints and solve their problems.
<br /><br />9.  Listening: As workers go up the corporate ladder, the listening time increases so that top managers spend as much as 65 percent of their day listening (Keefe, 1971). Because most people have had no training in this critical skill, poor listening habits cost hundreds of millions of dollars each year in productivity lost through misunderstandings and mistakes. At the rate of one $15 mistake per U.S. employee per year, the annual cost of poor listening would be more than a billion dollars.
<br /><br />10. Problem-solving: Problem-solving skills include the ability to recognize and define problems, invent and implement solutions, and track and evaluate results. Creative thinking not only requires the ability to understand problem-solving techniques, but also to transcend logical and sequential thinking, making the leap to innovation. Unresolved problems create dysfunctional relationships in the workplace. Ultimately, they become impediments to flexibility and in dealing with strategic change in an open-ended and creative way.
<br /><br />11. Creative thinking: New approaches to problem-solving, organizational design, and product development all spring from the individual capacity for creative thinking. At work, creative thinking is generally expressed through the process of creative problem solving. Increasingly, companies are identifying creative problem solving as critical to their success and are instituting structured approaches to problem identification, analysis, and resolution. Creative solutions help the organization to move forward toward strategic goals. Organizational strategy is an example of creative thinking.
<br /><br />12. Self-esteem: Another key to effectiveness is good personal management. Self-esteem, motivation/goal setting, and employability/career development skills are critical because they impact individual morale which in turn plays a significant role in an institutions ability to achieve bottom line results. Employers have felt the pressure to make provisions to address perceived deficiencies in these skill areas because they realize that a work force without such skills is less productive. Conversely, solid personal management skills are often manifested by efficient integration of new technology or processes, creative thinking, high productivity, and a pursuit of skill enhancement. Unfortunately, problems related to these skill areas have increased primarily because entry-level applicants are arriving with deficiencies in personal management skills. On the job, the lack of personal management skills affects hiring and training costs, productivity, quality control, creativity, and ability to develop skills to meet changing needs. This presents a series of roadblocks that slow or halt an organizations progress. An organization with such difficulties cannot plan accurately for its future to integrate new technology, establish new work structures, or implement new work processes.
<br /><br />13. Motivation/goal setting
<br />Motivation is the combination of desire, values, and beliefs that drives you to take action. These three motivating factors, and/or lack of them, are at the root of why people behave the way they do. Because you ultimately control your values, beliefs, and desires, you can influence your motivations. This means, if you consider something important and assign value to it, you are more likely to do the work it takes to attain the goal. When motivation originates from an internal source and is combined with a realistic goal and circumstance, the odds of a good outcome are greatly increased.
<br /><br />14. Employability/career development [See also Skill (labor)]: One of the keys to success in today’s world of work is career self-reliance — the ability to actively manage worklife in a rapidly changing environment and the attitude of being self-employed whether inside or outside an organization. Acquiring the skills and knowledge to become career self-reliant will enable employees to survive and even thrive in times of great change.
<br /><br />15: Group effectiveness: The move toward participative decision making and problem solving inevitably increases the potential for disagreement, particularly when the primary work unit is a peer team with no supervisor. This puts a premium on developing employees group effectiveness skills.
<br /><br />16. Interpersonal: Interpersonal skills training can help employees recognize and improve their ability to determine appropriate self-behaviour, cope with undesirable behaviour in others, absorb stress, deal with ambiguity, structure social interaction, share responsibility, and interact more easily with others. Teamwork skills are critical for improving individual task accomplishment because practical innovations and solutions are reached sooner through cooperative behaviour.
<br /><br />17. Negotiation and teamwork: Negotiation skills are critical for the effective functioning of teams as well as for individual acceptance in an organization. Change strategies are usually dependent upon the ability of employees to pull together and refocus on the new common goal. Carnevale wrote in a previous book that there are two ways to increase productivity. &amp;quot;The first is by increasing the intensity with which we utilize (human) resources (working harder), and the second is by increasing the efficiency with which we mix and use available resources (working smarter).&amp;quot;
<br /><br />18. Influence: The new competitive standards affect organizational structures, requiring a move away from top- down systems and toward more flexible networks and work teams. Technical changes result in new work processes and procedures. These require constant updating of employer-specific technical knowledge. In a world of rapid change, obsolescence is an interminable danger. As technology replaces more of the hands-on work, more employees will be dedicated to service functions where they will spend more time face-to-face with co-workers and clients. Organizational formats in the New Economy require more general skills. Interpersonal skills, communications skills and effective leadership skills are required by more and more non-supervisory employees. Managers in the New Economy relinquish control of work processes to work teams and will need to provide integration through leadership and monitoring.
<br /><br />Organizational: To be effective, employees need a sense of how the organization works and how the actions of each individual affect organizational and strategic objectives. Skill in determining the forces and factors that interfere with the organizations ability to accomplish its tasks can help the worker become a master problem solver, an innovator, and a team builder. Organizational effectiveness skills are the building blocks for leadership. A proactive approach toward increasing organizational effectiveness skills through training reflects the commitment to shared leadership concepts operating in the organization. Implementing shared leadership values has a positive impact on productivity. When leadership functions are dispersed, those who perform in leadership roles willingly take on the responsibility for creating and communicating the vision of the organization and what its work groups should accomplish. By their proximity, they are also better able to create and communicate the quality of the work environment necessary to realize that vision. One approach is the superteam which is defined as a high performing team which produces outstanding achievements. Leaders of superteams spend as much time anticipating the future as they do managing the present by thinking forward to, and talking to others about their goal, for it is this that provides the team with its purpose and direction (Hastings, Bixby, and Chaudhry-Lawton, 1986). Deploying visionary leaders improves institutional response time to changing and increasingly complex external environment factors that affect the organization's ability to operate effectively.
<br /><br />19. Leadership: At its most elementary level, leadership means that one person influences another. An organization that supports the concepts of shared leadership encourages employees at all levels to assume this role where it is appropriate. The function of leadership include stating basic values, announcing goals, organizing resources, reducing tensions between individuals, creating coalitions, coalescing workers, and encouraging better performance. There is a direct correlation between the implementation of shared leadership practice and product improvement, higher morale, and innovative problem solving, which leads to a more hospitable environment for instituting change. Top management cannot make the system work without employees taking on shared leadership roles. A great many people must be in a state of psychological readiness to take leaderlike action to improve the functioning at their levels. Historically, the roots of business failure can often be traced to inadequate training in and attention to the importance of leadership as a basic workplace skill. Too frequently, companies designate leaders without providing proper evaluation and training to ensure that they are qualified to assume leadership roles.
<br /><br />Every type of skills that can ever be imagined will clearly fall into the following broad categories:
<br />1.  Academic skills
<br />     *  Reading
<br />     *  Logic
<br />     *  Critical thinking
<br />     *  Math
<br /><br />2.  Interpersonal communication
<br />     *  Speech: listening, talking
<br />     *  Nonverbal communication
<br />     *  Literacy: writing, reading
<br /><br />3.  Motor skills
<br />    *  Walking, craft, sport
<br /><br />4.  Creativity, Innovation
<br />     *  Music, arts, and crafts
<br />     *  Skilled labor
<br />     *  Innovation skill
<br /><br />The pertinent question at this point then is:
<br />1.  What are your potentials?
<br /><br />2.  What skills do you have?
<br /><br />3.  How efficient are you with the skills you have?

I want to particularly thank Professor B. C. Ozumba who I am sure nominated me for this great assignment.  It is an indication of his special confidence in me.  In a way too, for me, it is like coming home to an Institution that invested so much in me so that by this role which I am playing today, I am enjoying the privilege of being part of this University’s effort as it tries to establish this chair in honour of one of its greatest professors who has passed on to the great beyond.
<br /><br />Professor Kessandu Ogan was the founding Head of Department of Obstetrics and Gyneacology in this College of Medicine which has produced over six thousand (6000) Doctors since its inception.  Pioneers often grapple with a myriad of problems.  They assemble pioneer staff, procure first sets of equipment, handle accreditation matters and interpret approved curriculum as well as implement them so that over time they set standards which are supposed to compare with best practices locally and internationally.  When the pioneer’s visions are clear and when he diligently sets out to lay enduring foundations he ends up crafting a system that stands firm no matter the intensity of tectonic forces that buffet the foundations the pioneer lays.  Products from this medical school are creating waves all over the world in the practice of medicine, which to me, is an indication of the solidity or impregnability of the foundations on which the Medical School of our University of Nigeria was built by the pioneers who laid the foundations on which it stands today.  One of those who took pain in establishing this College on sound, very sound foundations, is our elder brother Professor Kesandu Ogan who is being honoured today.
<br /><br />Since I was told to speak on any topic of my choice, I decided to look back in time, especially the time when Professor Kesandu Ogan laid the foundation which is still standing today.  I have therefore gone even beyond this time, as far as my own experiences and indeed the recorded experiences of others.  I have tried to identify other great authors of great foundations that have stood the time.
<br /><br />I have chosen the topic so as to remind us all who are beneficiaries of these standing foundations that we owe their authors some respect or gratitude.  The foundations which these heroes laid for us were supposed to be there for us to stand on and launch this nation to another level of growth and accomplishment.  It would then be for us to individually and collectively ask ourselves whether we have done well, given the foundations laid for us to operate from.  It will be an opportunity for us to see whether we have advanced their worthy expectations of us or whether we have been woeful failures in the accomplishment of their plans for us.  My discussion will apply generally to Nigeria but I will pay particular attention to the situation as it affects the South East of Nigeria.  I know too that the situation is not particularly different in other geopolitical zones of Nigeria.
<br /><br />Professor Kesandu Ogan was a teacher and medical doctor who practiced at the summit of these positions.  I am also aware that he served in other capacities outside these two areas.  For the purpose of our interaction today, I see him as a pioneer teacher who taught medicine and laid the foundation as a great teacher of medicine in this College of Medicine.
<br /><br />SOME OF THE GREAT FOUNDATIONS AND THEIR AUTHORS
<br />1.	TRANSPORT SECTOR:  One of the thrills I had growing up was to travel by train.  There were times I     would, along with mates in 70s, board a train from Umuahia to Enugu and return to Umuahia.  The Railway System afforded parents the means for moving their children unaccompanied from their stations of residence to their school stations.  Northern bound students whose parents resided in the North would merely accompany their wards to railway stations and had no fears whatsoever about their safety.  It was no wonder that some of the most known towns in Nigeria were located along the Railway lines – Markurdi, Oturkpo, Enugu, Afikpo, Ovim, Umuahia, Aba, Port Harcourt, Kafanchan, Zaria, Ibadan, Lagos etc.  Those who laid the foundation for the Railway System in Nigeria had great plans.  From the North, the Rails provided easy facilities for moving economic products to either the Port Harcourt ports or the Lagos ports.  Cattle, palm produce, groundnuts, minerals especially solid minerals, were moved to their ports of export at very low cost and in great safety.  I can remember very few accidents; the Langalanga disaster in particular.  While travelling by train, you could move about from coach to coach, interact with co-passengers and make great friends.  The foundation was well thought out and religiously implemented.  It made the roads as a means of transport less congested and consequently long lasting.
<br /><br />What do we see today?  Railway lines have become market places where all sorts of merchandise are sold. Some property of the Railway Corporation have been appropriated and sold by invisible but palpable Nigerians.  Heavy trucks of all dimensions and make ply our roads.  Night travels have become a way to reduce the congestions.  Commuters travel at great risks to lives.  Even with an efficient Federal Road Safety Corps, accidents of great dimensions and robberies are common features on our roads.  Despite huge sums of monies invested in road construction yearly, the roads fail with constant rapidity and vexatious frequency.  If our Government had built on the foundations of the colonial masters, we would have been somewhere else as a nation in the transportation of goods in this country.  One would have expected that by now the Railways would have been extended to Calabar, Warri, Benin, Sokoto, Ogoja.  Speed trains that facilitate movement of human beings in advanced economies and in reasonable comfort should long have been a feature of our transportation system.  In place of the Railway we “invented transport by motorbikes” whose major contribution to the economy was the advancement of the practice of orthopaedic medicine and amputation of limbs with expert skills across the nations.  Robbery by “these skilled motorbike transporters” has caused us to advance into another great improvement in the transport sector, the introduction of “keke Napep”.
<br /><br />I still remember that our Inland waterways were fully de3veloped and functioned efficiently as a means for travelling.  I enjoyed traveling by boat between Calabar and Oron in dignity and comfort as a young man.  I do not know what happened to such companies as the Elder Dempster Lines.  Greta foundations existed in the transport sector of our economy.  Who uprooted those great foundations?  Why have we not grown these institutions beyond where we met them some 30 years ago?
<br /><br />2.	COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY: during our studies of Geography in those days, even a dull pupil could represent the Map of Nigeria, showing the location of industries then.  Even now, as I speak, I can, in my miknd imagine the map of Nigeria and locate such great industries as Nkalagu Cement Factory, Michelin Factory in Port Harcourt, Leather Tanneries in Zaria not to talk of numerous others located in Lagos.  In that map I can imagine the location of those great pyramids of groundnuts,  those  blooming oil plantations and mills in Calabar, Sapele and Benin from where the Malaysians picked a few trees to develop theirs to what it is today.  I can imagine the sea ports in Nigeria and the activities of old UAC (not Mr. Biggs) SCOA, and similar other commercial establishments that gave employment to our parents.  These companies also existed as responsible corporate citizens.  In the East, I remember the great Ceramics Industry located very close to the Golden Breweries.  Can I ever forget the radio jiggles on “Oyoyo Mmin”?  What could have happened to the foundations laid by our earlier political leaders in Commerce and Industry?  Does Nkalagu still exist as a town?  Could it be that the limestone there got exhausted?   Could we not have developed our cement industry to a level that we should now have been net exporters of cement?  What happened to the foundations?  What?
<br /><br />3.	POWER: I grew up to know of ECN.  It even had a football club.  It did not have so many power generating stations but it provided steady power.  It had Afam.  It also had Oji River Power Station.  Then, great Nigerian with foresight emerged and developed the Kanji Dams.  I think later too, these were further expanded to include Igbim and Sapele Stations and ECN became NEPA the acronym for darkness.  It would appear to me that while new stations were built, old stations were left to rot.  The turbines and other facilities at the Shiroro and other dams were hardly serviced or maintained until NEPA metamorphosed into an institution that withholds power.  As we grew as a nation, no corresponding growth was recorded in this direction.  Our sense of maintenance of structures leaves much to be desired.  Today, numerous power stations are being built on the pages of newspapers all over the nation.  Only God knows when they will be completed and made functional.  Targets of Megawatts are continually being announced and re-announced with nauseating regularity.  Everywhere, there is darkness; solid darkness despite the early foundations set up to avert this darkness.  Why?
<br /><br />4.	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES: Nigeria is one of the most blessed countries in the world. We used to be the world’s leading producers of Columbite.  Jos is known as the City of Tin on account of the volume of tin that was mined there for many years.  Today, Jos is the city where Nigerians kill themselves and bury in the evacuations that litter in the tin city.  We have gold, iron, and several other minerals.  Enugu, where we are today, stands on coal.  Many of us here today are children of parents who made their living working in different capacities in the coal industry.  Australia, China, England, as advanced as their economies are, and in spite of the fact that they have numerous alternatives sources of energy, have not abandoned their Coal Mines.  Of course we have oil.  There is nothing wrong in developing our oil and gas industry.  But a situation where other minerals should be added to support our oil wealth to provide even development and vast employment opportunities has been squandered.  Even in the oil industry, after the establishment of the Refineries at Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna and despite the growth in our institutions that would use petroleum products, successive governments have found it difficult to increase our refining capacity to meet our ever growing local demands.  In the past 20 years, none of our refineries has worked at full capacity; turn – around maintenance has always been the products from these refineries.  For the past many years, Nigeria has been importing fuel from countries that probably have no oil than we have.  The consequences are legion:
<br />•	 We pay high prices for products that we ourselves have.
<br />•	We grow the economy of those countries from where we import oil.
<br />•	We leave our citizens who would have gained employment in an expanding oil and gas company     
<br />roaming the streets, in hunger and anger, unemployed.
<br />•	We have inadvertently developed a larger number of restive youths who are targets of recruitment in the hands of the enemies of our country who want to blow everybody up.
<br />•	Today Government is talking of removal of fuel subsidy so that it can raise money and invest in other sectors of the economy, an action which in the short run at least would weaken the earning power of all Nigerians even is in the long run, subject to good husbandry of funds, it could improve the economy.
<br /><br />What happened to the early foundations which those who built our early refineries established in our extractive industries?  Why did we abandon the coal in Kogi, Benue and Enugu States?  Is our Columbite finished?  Why is it that everywhere Government spends huge sums of money, money that should have been productively invested, fighting illegal miners all over the country?  If Sarduna, Zik, Awolowo and Okpara were to visit us today, they would shudder at the depth of our descent and the damage we have done to the foundations that they laid.
<br /><br />5.	THE NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE CORPS: In 1973, the government of General Gowon established the National Youth Service Corps.  Through the establishment of this institution, highly trained youths were evenly distributed all over the country to affect the economy positively.  Schools at the Secondary level benefited and our children were better taught.  Young Nigerians who would never have travelled out of their communities of origin were compelled to do so and their earlier held negative biases were wiped off.
<br /><br />I first went up north as a Youth Corps member and it was an experience I continue to recall with nostalgia.  The youth Corps members were symbols of National Unity who mixed freely with the natives of their places of primary posting and who also sometimes got married and integrated into those communities.  Many of us here participated in this programme and can recall the great receptions we received and the invaluable contributions we made in places where we were posted.
<br /><br />Today the Corps member is a youth compelled “to serve” outside his community by the Government but rejected and despised by the people he is posted to serve.  The Corps member today is a victim to be kidnapped and humiliated by his host community so that at the end of the service year he is so traumatized that his memories of the service year are bitter and these build up in him a feeling of total horror of unimaginable proportions.  Early this year, for doing a thankless but expedient duty in our electoral processes, the youth corps member was bombed to smithereens or burnt into ashes by people who were supposed to protect him and for reasons which defy understanding.  Gowon who is alive today would be wondering where this great institution, built on very sound foundation, began to experience this crack which today is metamorphosing into a quake.
<br /><br />The NYSC Scheme is not the only foundation that Gowon laid for Nigeria.  He introduced the National Sports Festival which brought the youths of the nation together in healthy competitions.  From these competitions great sports men were identified early and groomed into stardom.  Today there are hardly any honestly assembled youths for such competitions.  Aged and over recycled athletes aref continually assembled and school sports are killed out-rightly so that Nigerians hardly make any impact in the international sporting arena.  A country that produced Hogan Bassey, Dick Tiger, Obisie Nwapa cannot even make any presence in the boxing arena even at the ECOWAS level. What a descent.  What happened to these great foundations?  Should we call back General Gowon?
<br /><br />What I have said in these aspects of our Economy manifests everywhere including agriculture.  We cannot talk of functional Water Boards any more in most parts of the country.  Instead we must go to India to treat minor medical cases which, had our medical experts been given basic equipment, they would have handled them with palpable ease.  Why should our people pay high airfares to go India to do a mymectomy?  Why?  The collapse of these great foundations is manifest everywhere but I want to paint the exact picture of what it is in the educational sector in the South East of Nigeria.  
<br /><br />6.	THE STATE OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH EAST: Before the Civil war, the ownership of educational institutions was not concentrated in the hands of Government.  Government operated as a very strong and well organized regulator of practices in the field of Education.  It spelt out the rules and had very well staffed Inspectorate Divisions with offices at the zonal levels.  Before schools were approved, certain standards were insisted on.  These standards were not limited to the quality of human capacity.  Physical structures and expansive land acreage where practical agriculture could be practiced and play grounds for health and physical education existed were mandatory conditions for schools to earn approval.  The visit to any existing school for inspection by inspectors of the Ministry of Education was usually regarded as very sacrosanct. The inspectors could recommend the closure of such schools if the standards were found to have been compromised in any way.
<br /><br />To demonstrate Government expectations in terms of standards, government owned a few model schools.  In the old Eastern Region, the Government Secondary Schools were: Government College, Umuahia; Queens College, Enugu; Government Secondary School, Owerri; Government Secondary School, Afikpo; and Government Comprehensive Secondary School, Port Harcourt.  Most of thre Schools at both the Primary and Secondary tiers were shared between the missions: Catholic Mission, Methodist, Anglican Mission, Presbyterian Mission, Qua Iboe Mission, Lutheran Mission.  Other schools were owned by communities.  Very few private schools but they were very high standards.  These missions had their managers who supervised these schools and ensured that the standards set by the ministries were maintained.
<br /><br />Every mission strove to ensure that it compared with the Government Model Schools at Umuahia, Owerri, Afikpo, Enugu and Port Harcourt.  These schools acquitted themselves creditably by the standards they set so that nobody could ever find fault with the products of the great Hope Waddel Institute, the unique Christ the Kings College and its Anglican counterpart also in Onitsha, the Dennis Memorial Grammar School.  There was the Etinan Institute owned by Qua Iboe Church, College of Immaculate Conception at Enugu.  There was also the great Methodist Girls School, Ovim and Methodist College, Uzuakoli and the Aggrey Memorial College in Arochukwu.  Who would forget the Union Schools at Elelenwo and Ibiaku or the Rosary Schools at Nsukka, Onitsha and Umuahia?  Who could quarrel with the product of these institutions?  
<br /><br />Then the Government of the East Central State led by Dr. Ukpabi Asika took over schools and by that process took away God from the schools.  In the South East of Nigeria in particular, it marked the beginning of the descent in quality of education and culminated into the rot that pervades the entire educational system today.  Any visit today to any of these formerly tested Government Model Schools in Umuahia, Enugu, Owrri, Afikpo and Port Harcourt would make one weep.  If the founders of these great schools were to resurrect today they would place curses on all of us who have destroyed what they took pains – great pains to build.
<br /><br />At the old Government College Umuahia, the WAEC would send down question papers well in advance to the Principal of the School who kept such question papers safely and sacredly until the exams were taken on schedule without any compromises of any sort.  I am told that the practice was not exclusive to Government College, Umuahia.  Other leading school principals were satisfactorily assigned the same roles and they acquitted themselves creditably.  What do we have today in our school system in the South East? I want to share some statistics with you on this matter.  These statistics are from WAEC and they are verifiable.  But before the statistics, let me reproduce an observation that I made in 2008 during my inaugural lecture.
<br /><br />•	 EXTENT OF THE ROT
<br />At the Secondary level the rot is awesome.  Secondary schools have no laboratories and science is studied just like history and literature.  Teachers are in short supply and schools are overcrowded.  Teachers’ salaries are often in arrears.  Agricultural practical are hardly attended to.  The private secondary schools answer esoteric names like educational giants and arrogate examination miracles to themselve in a bid to attract misinformed but rich parents who are ready to pay huge sums of sums of money as a guarantee for securing good certificates not backed by knowledge for their wards.
<br /><br />Consequently a new trend has become the norm rather than the exception.  Special external examination centers spring up daily to give illicit cover to school pupils as they cheat themselves to questionable external examination certificates. The situation is so bad that WAEC had to issue this report which is quite long but which I have tried to reproduce as a way of explaining the extent of the rot.
<br /><br />“For a very long time now, conduct of west African Examination Council (WAEC) in Ukwa Zone has become very hazardous.  It has become a matter of life and death on the part of candidates, invigilators, supervisors, inspectors, and WAEC officials on examination duty in the area.  It has reached a point where examination officials, namely WAEC staff, Supervisors, Invigilators and other inspectors have vowed not to go Ukwa ant longer for examination.”
<br /><br />The report therefore gave eleven specific examples of the nature of malpractices before drawing conclusions.  One of such examples, the eleventh is stated thus:
<br /><br />“During the current November/December 2005 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), about ten (10) hefty and fierce men in black apparels, like cultists, stormed a centre and started harassing candidates and examination officials by collecting money from them.  This happened in September 26, 2005 during Biology 2 Paper.  There was confusion and the examination was disrupted.”
<br /><br />Then the report concluded thus:
<br /><br />“It is not that examination malpractices do not happen in other places in Abia State in particular, or Nigeria in general, but those being experienced in Ukwa Zone are out of the ordinary.  Malpractices that involve armed robbery, threats to life, fighting and injuring people and hostage at gun points appear to be on the extreme.  We should not fold our hands until examination officials are killed before we act.”
<br /><br />(Report culled from 2005 WAEC Report)
<br /><br />If you look critically at the table below you would be curious at the distribution of total candidates per state who enter for WAEC examinations.

<br /><br />Note:
<br />-	 In 2000, Abia State entered 25,903 students for WASCE, Rivers entered 5,799; Abia had 20,204 candidates more than Rivers State.
<br /><br />-	In 2003, Abia entered 15,234 experiencing a decline of 10,669 Rivers entered 88,757 experiencing an increase of 82,958.
<br /><br />-	In 2000, Abia was leading Rivers with about 19,000 candidates.  In 2003, Rivers was leading Abia with about 73,000 candidates.
<br /><br />These statistics tell so much about what is going on in these areas.  Rivers State shares a common boundary with Ukwa LGA in Abia State.  It is not uncommon to see Abia indigenes leaving Abia State at times of external examinations in drove to Rivers State to write their examination with very high levels of success.  But these successes are quite questionable when you interact with those candidates with these miraculous results.  There is no doubt that Rivers State has made giant strides in educational attainments in recent times but those statistics of the results and the atmosphere under which the exams are taken. Without casting aspersions, there is need for the Nigerian society to look at these figures with greater circumspection as they are more likely to conclude that these could not but be evidence of the rot in the system.
<br /><br />Below is the statistics of sale of forms for WASCE for 2005 as they pertain to selected Igbo States and Rivers State.  Suddenly Rivers State enrolls more candidates in WAEC examinations that the three (3) Igbo States put together.  What I think is happening is that conditions in Rivers state makes it possible for candidates from Igbo States, especially Abia and Imo to go there to take examinations in conditions which guarantee high level of success that are no reflections of the candidates abilities.

<br /><br />a.	 Where does Rivers State, for instance, recruit its seasoned burst of students from?
<br />b.	Are Abians no longer interested in educational pursuits?
<br />c.	Why is it that students prefer to write exams in certain States when there are facilities begging for use in their home States?
<br />d.	Has Nigeria, any part of Nigeria for that matter, got enough Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics lecturers to handle such subjects in our secondary Schools across the Country?
<br />e.	And if the answer is NO, why are there so many graduates in the fields looking for jobs and receiving no attention? 
<br /><br />I had stated earlier that although Prof. Kesandu served in other public service posts, he was primarily a teacher and a medical doctor.  As a teacher, if he were to re-incarnate in whatever form today he would certainly not be pleased with what we, his successors, have done with our educational system and I am not limiting myself to the first and second tiers of education - the rot also manifest at the third tier.  I was particularly worried when about six years ago or thereabout, our University of Nigeria law Faculty lost National University Commission (NUC) accreditation. Although it did not take long to get it back into reckoning, it was something that could not have been contemplated in the years of Professor Nwaogwugwu and others who too were great pioneers and foundation builders.  I may not need to say it loud lest Kesandu hears it too that recently our own College of Medicine was denied accreditation not because of dearth of human capacity or indeed other capacities but because of certain practices that he would have frowned at.  I am reliable informed that the situation has been corrected and our College is back on stream.  Situations in our tertiary institutions that make students never to know when to be issued with their certificates and mobilized for NYSC is to say the least most unfortunate.  Sometimes graduates are kept for decades by their supervisors.  However, I know that some of these graduate students are substandard, people who in the old tradition would never have been allowed into graduate school.  There are a number of practices to mark the older years when our Icon and his contemporaries served with humility and commitment.  Something needs to be done about the fallen standards in our school systems from bottom to top.
<br /><br />7.	DECAY IN THE HEALTH SECTOR: Between 1963 AND 1967 when the civil war erupted I grew up in Abakaliki at age 6 – 14.  The Abakaliki General Hospital as it was known then functioned very efficiently as my own judgment then would tell me.  The Senior Medical Officers (SMO) then was a certain Dr. Azie.  I recall that when I was admitted into Government College Umuahia and was told to bring a medical certificate of fitness from a Government Hospital, I went unaccompanied to the Abakaliki General Hospital and at no cost and with little constraints.  Dr. Azie (SMO) examined me and gave me a paper on which he wrote what he found out about me.  Several times the too, if I fell ill I would go to the hospital and get treated at no cost.  There were no protocols.  Health services were there for everyone who needed it and it was free.  Governments then did not go about announcing “XYZ free medical programme” that never existed as is the practice today.  What happened at the Abakaliki General Hospital was not an exception.  It was the rule all over Eastern Region. It is now an exception.  In the past nearly ten (10) years, it has become the practice of Native Doctors to organize trade fairs in the premises of Government owned Broadcast Houses where  they announce how they can cure all sorts of diseases especially the “gonokakus and staphilokakus” varieties.  They recite well crammed medical terms to give the impression of authenticity and deceive the less informed of the society.  When you hear them recite medical jargons with rehearsed efficiency you wonder which Medical College they attended.  Each time Government owned media allow them to deceive the public with their “deodorized shit” I weep for our country.  I weep for the medical profession.  I am not a medical doctor but I know that the ethics of the profession do not permit self advertisement.  How would Kesandu react if he were alive to listen to this medical trash?  These days native doctors call themselves tradomedical practitioners and at public functions they are usually introduced as Dr. so so and so.  These days when anybody tells me he is a doctor, I ask whether trado or orthodox?  I could go further to ask his specialty: whether Gonokakist or Staphilokakist.  That is how low the medical practice has gone. 
<br /><br />In the newspaper recently, the issue of the Billions of naira spent by the Federal Government in equipping our Tertiary Medical institutions has been on; not for good reasons but just because the equipment have not been located or that those that were located are not functioning.  Who gave the shipping list?  What role did Doctors, especially, Doctors at these tertiary institutions play?  Where were you?  There is a Naval Hospital in Calabar; where there exists a very large structure that has gotten to the level of 90% completion since the past 30 years.  It has remained so ever after.  In the USA, military hospitals are research institute that boast some of the best in all fields of medicine.  They are equipped to carry out medical emergencies at short notices and to collaborate with good effect with University Hospitals.  Here, our emergency wards are located in far away India.  Some twenty years ago, some of us left our shores to go and practice in Saudi Arabia.  I do not know if your Hippocratic Oath prescribes that a doctor in a third world country can abandon his patients to go and practice in Saudi Arabia.  Was that the best way to confront the challenge?
<br /><br />Biafran doctors practiced medicine in deprived Biafra and sustained our confidence.  They performed medical feats with crude implements and courageously commitment even when under fire from enemy forces at day and at night.  Kesandu and his colleagues: Udokwu, Kaine and Nwokolo did so much to place this college on sound foundations.  Why are we allowing their foundations to give way?  Those open air heart surgeries why have they ceased to continue: or even improve?  Why? 
<br /><br />8.	THE KESANDU CHAIR: Kesandu was a teacher of outstanding qualities.  He was an expert Gyneacologist in a class marked out by it rarity.  Any chair in his honour must not mock him but should project those ideas he stood for.  I am happy that a chair is being endowed in his hour.  The value of this chair must be quite high and commensurate with the stature of our subject.  It should be such as could attract the best the best brains in his field of specialty.  Such a brain should be able to re-invent the discipline which the contemporaries of Professor Kesandu Ogan exhibited in their time.  He should not only be a distinguished professor of Obstetrics and Gyneacology, he should be an erudite administrator who would be able to harness all the resources available to him in the advancement of the teaching and practice of medicine.  He should also be able to pioneer research in new areas that need to be tackled for the good of Nigerians and Africa.  He should be able to stamp his feet in the world map of Obstetrics and Gyneacology.  His presence should attract similar class of personnel from all over the globe.  He should be able to identify bright and young graduates with promise and retain as well as grow them into great experts in the various fields of medicine.
<br /><br />I know that later today we would be called upon to make donations towards this chair.  I have already made some.  I will make some more today.  I call on all of us here to make commitments so that we will have sufficient funds to sustain this chair.  The test would not be whether we start today; it would be in the state of the in the next ten years and beyond.  Would the foundation be firm?  Would it be able to stand the strains and vagaries of tomorrow?  Would it be able to meet the needs of man in the areas of Health Services?  If we are not sure of what we want to do, we could call it off now and save ourselves future embarrassments.  Kesandu was a great Obstetrics and Gyneacology Professor who served his people very well.  Some of the guests we have today are structures; human that he constructed in his time.  It behoves us therefore to decide whether to consolidate these structures or demolish them with criminal haste.   
<br /><br />9.	POSTSCRPT:
<br />•	 CALLING OFF THE INDIAN BLUFF: I have found that if Nigerians can travel to India to treat Prostate Enlargement then they would be able to pay for the best medical services here in Nigeria if we can raise our standards to the Indian kevel.  Air transport to India costs around one million naira.  Accommodation bills are comparatively costly.  Then there is the cost of treatment.  When, sometimes as it does happen, some of these medical tourists die in India, it cost huge sums of money to bring home the corpses.
<br /><br />I know that Nigerian Doctors are some of the most skillful in their different specialties.  You can come together and invest in medical institutions that will stock state of the art equipment which I think are the major constraints we have.  With well articulated proposals, I have no doubt that financial institutions can fund the proposals.  If our people who go to India to seek medical attention can find alternative services here, they would cease to go to India.  Medical Services of the best standards would be given them at far more cheaper rates.  The economy would be better for it.  Medical practice would advance here and the shame we suffer as a nation will be wiped off.  Kesandu would then smile in gratitude to all of you.  That to me too would be a befitting way of honouring him and others like him.
<br /><br />•	LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL ANGLE: The Nigerian Medical Association should sponsor a bill that will make it criminal for any sitting President/Vice President, Governor/Deputy Governor and other political officers to go abroad for medical attention.  This in my opinion will compel them to invest in our medical institutions so that the right equipment will be procured, installed and maintained.
<br /><br />The Saudis used their oil wealth to grow their medical institutions.  We should do no less.  I do not know how you feel as doctors when you hear that some Nigerian patients suffering from burns are flown to South African or Egypt for medical attention.  It makes me weep.  It should not be. 
<br /><br />10.	CONCLUSION: Great Nigerians existed in the time of Kesandu.  In Commerce we had Sir Odimegwu Ojukwu; in History we had Kenneth Dike; in the Military we had Ironsi and Ojukwu; in Politics we had Zik, Okpara and Mbadiwe; in the Sciences we had Eni Njoku; in Mathematics we had Chike Obi; in Literature we had a glut of them: Achebe, Ekwensi, Onuorah Nzekwu, Chuukwemka Ike, Emmanuel Obiechina, Kalu Uka; in Political Science there was Kalu Ezra.  There is no field of learning or profession that our people did not leave enduring marks.  Although the Yorubas started before us, we did, at one point, catch up with them.  I am not sure that is the case today.  Every one of us must try to identify where we have failed to advance the foundations of our great leaders, many who are gone.  I am sure that whenever Achebe reads the works Chimamanda Adichie he will smile, aware that the foundations he left are still standing.  With Onyerionwu doing the much he is doing in Literary Criticism, I am sure that Obiechina, Emenyonu and their contemporaries will not be disappointed.  We need to re-invent Nigeria.  We need to strengthen the foundations.  We need to reassess our attitude of running away to India or Saudi Arabia.  We need to stamp our feet on the ground and arrest the deterioration.  We need to feel for this great Gyneacologist, Kesandu, who went beyond the literary meaning of his name, struggling to give life to his people.  We need to create a smile on his face wherever he is.  I do not know why Nigerian Doctors cannot invest in medicine outside Government and Mission Hospitals and practice in their specialties according to the dictates of their consciences and competences.
<br /><br />I hope that in the few years, other Africans and perhaps Indians would be visiting Nigeria, especially University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital to get treatment for some ailments, any ailment.  That would be a fitting tribute to the life of Professor O. Kessandu Ogan, and the Great Foundations set up.

<br />Proactivity means that, as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. There are three central values in life: the experiential (that which happens to us), the creative (that which we bring into existence), and the attitudinal (our response to difficult circumstances). What matters most is how we respond to what we experience in life. Proactivity is grounded in facing reality but also understanding we have the power to choose a positive response to our circumstances. We need to understand how we focus our time and energy to be effective. The things we
<br />are concerned about could be described as our &quot;Circle of Concern&quot;. There are things we can really do something about, that can be described as our &quot;Circle of Influence&quot;. When we focus our time and energy in our Circle of Concern, but outside our Circle of Influence, we are not being effective. However, we find that being proactive helps us expand our Circle of Influence. (Work on things you can do something about.) 
<br /><br />Reactive people focus their efforts on the Circle of Concern, over things they can't control. Their negative energy causes their Circle of Influence to shrink. Sometimes we make choices with negative  consequences, called mistakes. We can't recall or undo past mistakes. The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it. Success is the far side of failure.
<br />At the heart of our Circle of Influence is our ability to make and keep commitments and promises. Our integrity in keeping commitments and the ability to make commitments are the clearest manifestations of proactivity.
<br /><br />Habit 2: Begin With The End In Mind, Personal Leadership
<br />There are three major aspects of our personal and business management. First is leadership what do I/we want to accomplish? Second is management how can I best accomplish it? Third is productivity doing it. According to Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, &quot;Management is doing things right; Leadership is doing the right things.&quot;A starting point in beginning with the end in mind is to develop a personal mission statement, philosophy or credo. It will help you focus on what you want to be (character), do (contributions and achievements) and on the values and principles upon which your being and doing are based. The personal mission statement gives us a changeless core from which we can deal with external change.
<br />The principles we base our lives on should be deep, fundamental truths, classic truths, or generic common denominators. They will become tightly interwoven themes running with exactness, consistency, beauty and strength through the fabric of our lives. In developing your personal mission statement, you can use your creative ability to imagine life milestones such as birthdays, anniversaries, retirement and funerals. What accomplishments would you like to celebrate? Visualize them in rich detail. 
<br /><br />Habit 3: Put First Things First Principles of Personal Management
<br />“Habit 1 (I am the Programmer); Habit 2 (Write the Program); (Habit 3 Execute the Program).”Habit 3 is Personal Management, the exercise of independent will to create a life congruent with your values, goals and mission. Time management is an essential skill for personal management. The essence of time management is to organize and execute around priorities. Methods of time management have developed in these stages: 
<br />1) notes and checklists recognizing multiple demands on our time; 
<br />2) calendars and appointment books scheduling events and activities; 
<br />3)prioritizing, clarifying values integrating our daily planning with goal setting (The downside of this approach is increasing efficiency can reduce the spontaneity and relationships of life.); 
<br />4) managing ourselves rather than managing time focusing in preserving and enhancing relationships and accomplishing results, thus maintaining the P/PC balance (production versus building production capacity).
<br /><br />A matrix can be made of the characteristics of activities, classifying them as urgent or not urgent, important or not important.
<br />Quadrant I activities are urgent and important called problems or crises. Focusing on Quadrant I results in it getting bigger and bigger until it dominates you.
<br />Quadrant III activities are urgent and not important, and often mis-classified as Quadrant I.
<br />Quadrant IV is the escape Quadrant activities that are not urgent and not important. Effective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because they aren't important. They shrink Quadrant I down to size by spending more time in Quadrant II.
<br />Quadrant II activities are important, but not urgent. Working on this Quadrant is the heart of personal time management. These are PC activities.
<br />Quadrant II activities are high impact activities that when done regularly would make a tremendous difference in your life. (Including implementing the Seven Habits.)
<br />Initially, the time for Quadrant II activities must come from Quadrants III and IV.
<br />Quadrant I can't be ignored, but should eventually shrink with attention to Quadrant II.
<br />1) Prioritize
<br />2) Organize Around Priorities
<br />3) Discipline yourself
<br />A critical skill for personal management is delegation. Effectively delegating to others is perhaps the single most powerful high leverage activity there is. Delegation enables you to devote your energies to highlevel
<br />activities in addition to enabling personal growth for individuals and organizations.
<br /><br />There are two types of delegation: Gofer Delegation and Supervision of Efforts (Stewardship). Using Gofer Delegation requires dictating not only what to do, but how to do it. The supervisor then must function as a &quot;boss,&quot; micromanaging the progress of the &quot;subordinate.&quot;
<br />More effective managers use Stewardship Delegation, which focuses on results instead of methods. People are able to choose the method to achieve the results. It takes more time up front, but has greater benefits. Stewardship Delegation requires a clear, upfront mutual understanding of and commitment to expectations in five areas:
<br />1. Desired Results Have the person see it, describe it, make a quality statement of what the results will look like and by when they will be accomplished.
<br />2. Guidelines Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate, and what potential &quot;failure paths&quot; might be. Keep the responsibility for results with the person delegated to.
<br />3. Resources Identify the resources available to accomplish the required results. 
<br />4. Accountability Set standards of performance to be used in evaluating the results and specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place.
<br />5. Consequences Specify what will happen as a result of the evaluation, including psychic or financial rewards and penalties.
<br />Immature people can handle fewer results and need more guidelines and more accountability interviews. Mature people can handle more challenging desired results with fewer guidelines and accountability interviews.
<br /><br />&quot;Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and
<br />he will become as he can and should be.&quot;
<br /><br />Paradigms of Interdependence
<br />The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or do, but who we are.
<br />In order to receive the benefits of interdependence, we need to create and care for the relationships that are the source of the benefits. The Emotional Bank Account describes how trust is built on a relationship. Positive behaviors are deposits building a reserve. Negative behaviors are withdrawals. A high reserve balance results in higher tolerance for our mistakes and more open communication. There are six major deposits we can make to the emotional bank account:
<br />1. Understanding the individual. An individual's values determine what actions will result in a deposit or a withdrawal for that individual. To build a relationship, you must learn what is important to the other person and make it as important to you as the other person is to you. Understand others deeply as individuals and then treat them in terms of that understanding.
<br />2. Attend to the little things, which are the big things in relationships.
<br />3. Keep commitments. Breaking a promise is a major withdrawal.
<br />4. Clarify expectations. The cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in ambiguous, conflicting expectations around roles and goals. Making an investment of time and effort up front saves time, effort and a major withdrawal later.
<br />5. Show personal integrity. A lack of integrity can undermine almost any effort to create a high trust reserve. Honesty requires conforming our words to reality. Integrity requires conforming reality to our words, keeping promises and fulfilling expectations. The key to the many is the one, especially the one that tests the Patience and good humor of the many. How you treat the one reveals how you regard the many, because everyone is ultimately a one.
<br />6. Apologize sincerely when you make a withdrawal. Sincere apologies are deposits, but repeated apologies are interpreted as insincere, resulting in withdrawals.
<br /><br />Habit 4: Think Win! Win!!
<br />Win/Win is one of six total philosophies of human interaction.
<br />1. Win/Win People can seek mutual benefit in all human interactions. Principle based behavior.
<br />2. Win/Lose The competitive paradigm: if I win, you lose. The leadership style is authoritarian. In  relationships, if both people aren't winning, both are losing.
<br />3. Lose/Win The &quot;Doormat&quot; paradigm. The individual seeks strength from popularity based on acceptance. The leadership style is permissiveness.
<br />4. Lose/Lose When people become obsessed with making the other person lose, even at their own expense.
<br />5. Win Focusing solely on getting what one wants, regardless of the needs of others.
<br />6. Win/Win or No Deal If we can't find a mutually beneficial solution, we agree to disagree agreeably no
<br />deal. This approach is most realistic at the beginning of a business relationship or enterprise. In a continuing relationship, it's no longer an option.
<br /><br />When relationships are paramount, Win/Win is the only viable alternative. In a competitive situation where building a relationship isn't important, Win/Lose may be appropriate. There are five dimensions of the Win/Win model: Character, Relationships, Agreements, Supportive Systems and Processes.
<br /><br />1. Character is the foundation of Win/Win. There must be integrity in order to establish trust in the relationship and to define a win in terms of personal values.
<br />2. Relationships are the focus on Win/Win. Whatever the orientation of the person you are dealing with (Win/Lose, etc.), the relationship is the key to turning the situation around.
<br />3. Performance agreements give definition and direction to Win/Win. They shift the paradigm of production from vertical (Superior Subordinate) to horizontal (Partnership/Team). The agreement should include elements to create a standard by which people can measure their own success.
<br />· Defined results (not methods) what is to be done and when.
<br />· Guidelines: the parameters within which the results should be accomplished
<br />· Resources: human, financial, technical or organizational support available to accomplish the results.
<br />· Accountability: the standards of performance and time(s) of evaluation.
<br />· Consequences: what will happen as a result of the evaluation.
<br />4. The Reward System is a key element in the Win/Win model. Talking Win/Win but rewarding Win/Lose results in negating the Win/Win paradigm. If the outstanding performance of a few is rewarded, the other team members will be losers. Instead, develop individual achievable goals and team objectives to be
<br />rewarded.
<br />Competition has its place against market competitors, last year's performance, or another location or individual where cooperation and interdependence aren't required, but cooperation in the workplace is as important to free enterprise as competition in the marketplace. The spirit of Win/Win cannot survive in an environment of competition or contests. All of the company's systems should be based on the principle of Win/Win. The Compensation system of the managers should be based on the productivity and
<br />development of their people. The Win/Win process has four steps.
<br />1. See the problem from the other point of view, in terms of the needs and concerns of the other party.
<br />2. Identify the key issues and concerns (not positions) involved.
<br />3. Determine what results would make a fully acceptable solution.
<br />4. Identify new options to achieve those results. 
<br /><br />Habit 5: Seek First to Understand Then to be Understood
<br />We often prescribe before making a proper diagnosis when communicating. We should first take the time to deeply understand the problems presented to us. Skills of empathic listening must be built on a character that inspires openness and trust and high emotional bank accounts. 
<br />Empathic Listening
<br />When another person is speaking, we usually &quot;listen&quot; at one of four levels: ignoring, pretending, selective listening, or attentive listening. We should be using the fifth, highest form of listening empathic listening.
<br />Empathic listening is listening with intent to understand the other person's frame of reference and feelings. You must listen with your ears, your eyes and your heart. Diagnose Before You Prescribe An effective salesperson seeks to understand the needs, concerns and situation of the customer. An amateur sells products, the professional sells solutions. Empathic listening takes time, but not as much time as backing up and correcting misunderstandings, including living with problems and the results of not giving the
<br />people you care about psychological air. Habit 5 is powerful because it focuses on your circle of influence. It's an inside out approach. You are focusing on building your understanding. You become influenceable,
<br />which is the key to influencing others. As you appreciate people more, they will appreciate you more.
<br /><br />Habit 6: Synergize (Principles of Creative Cooperation)
<br />Synergy means the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The essence of synergy is to value differences to respect them, to build on strengths, and to compensate for weaknesses. Synergistic communication is opening your mind and heart to new possibilities. It may seem like you are casting aside &quot;beginning with the end in mind,&quot; but you are actually fulfilling it by clarifying your goals and discovering better ones.  By taking the time to really build a team, creating a high emotional bank account, the group can become very closely knit. The respect among members can become so high
<br />that if there is a disagreement, there can be a genuine effort to understand. High trust leads to high cooperation and communication. The progression of communication is defensive (win or lose/win), to respectful (compromise), to synergistic (win/win).
<br /><br />By synergistically creating a mission statement, it becomes engraved in the hearts and minds of the participants. The problem is that highly dependent people are trying to succeed in an interdependent reality. They may talk win/win technique, but they want to manipulate others. These insecure people need to mold others to their way of thinking. The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction
<br />with the hearts and minds of other human beings. 
<br /><br />Habit 7: Principles of Balanced Self Renewal
<br />Habit 7 is taking the time to sharpen the saw. You must work proactively (Quadrant II) to renew the four dimensions of your nature physical, spiritual, mental and social/economic. The Physical Dimension The physical dimension involves caring for your physical body eating the right foods, getting enough rest and relaxation, and exercising on a regular basis. The Spiritual Dimension The spiritual dimension is your center, your commitment to your value system. It draws upon the sources that inspire and uplift you and tie you to timeless truths of humanity.
<br /><br />The Mental Dimension
<br />It's important keep your mind sharp by reading, writing, organizing and planning. Read broadly and expose yourself to great minds. The Social/Emotional Dimension Our emotional life is primarily developed out of and manifested in our relationships with others. Renewing our social/emotional dimension requires focus and exercise in our interaction with others.
<br />Self renewal must include balanced renewal in all four dimensions: physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional. Neglecting any one area negatively impacts the rest.
<br /><br />The 7 Habits...and what they'll do to help your group (Summary)
<br />· Be Proactive Fosters courage to take risks and accept new challenges to achieve goals
<br />· Begin with the End in Mind Brings projects to completion and unites teams and organizations under a shared vision, mission, and purpose
<br />· Put First Things First Promotes getting the most important things done first and encourages direct effectiveness
<br />· Think Win Win Encourages conflict resolution and helps individuals seek mutual benefit, increasing group momentum
<br />· Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood Helps people understand problems, resulting in targeted solutions; and promotes better communications, leading to successful problemsolving
<br />· Synergize Ensures greater &quot;buyin&quot; from team members and leverages the diversity of individuals to increase levels of success
<br />· Sharpen the Saw Promotes continuous improvements and safeguards against &quot;burnout&quot; and subsequent non productivity

The concept is not limited to self-help but includes formal and informal activities for developing others, in roles such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, coach, or mentor. Finally, as personal development takes place in the context of institutions, it refers to the methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems that support human development at the individual level in organizations.
<br /><br />At the level of the individual, personal development includes the following activities:
<br />a.  improving self-awareness
<br />b.  improving self-knowledge
<br />c.  building or renewing identity
<br />d.  developing strengths or talents
<br />e.  improving wealth
<br />f.   spiritual development
<br />g.  identifying or improving potential
<br />h.  building employability or human capital
<br />i.   enhancing lifestyle or the quality of life
<br />j.   improving health
<br />k.  fulfilling aspirations
<br />l.   initiating a life enterprise or personal autonomy
<br />m. defining and executing personal development plans
<br />n.  improving social abilities
<br /><br />The concept covers a wider field than self-development or self-help: personal development also includes developing others. This may take place through roles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees) or a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching).
<br /><br />Beyond improving oneself and developing others, personal development is a field of practice and research. As a field of practice it includes personal development methods, learning programs, assessment systems, tools and techniques. As a field of research, personal development topics increasingly appear in scientific journals, higher education reviews, management journals and business books.
<br /><br />Any sort of development — whether economic, political, biological, organizational or personal — requires a framework if one wishes to know whether change has actually occurred. In the case of personal development, an individual often functions as the primary judge of improvement, but validation of objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal development frameworks may include goals or benchmarks that define the end-points, strategies or plans for reaching goals, measurement and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path, and a feedback system to provide information on changes.

The goals of these programs are defined with the institution or by the institution and the results are assessed. With the acceptance of personal development as a legitimate field in higher education[citation needed], universities and business schools also contract programs to external specialist firms or to individuals. A partial list of business-to-business programs might include:
<br />courses and assessment systems for higher education organizations for their students management services to employees in organizations through:
<br />*  Training
<br />*  Training and development programs
<br />*  Personal-development tools
<br />*  Self-assessment
<br />*  Feedback
<br />*  Coaching
<br />*  Mentoring
<br />Some consulting firms specialize in personal development but as of 2009 generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources, recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market, not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting, training and coaching.
<br /><br />Origin:
<br />Major religions, such as the Abrahamic and Indian religions, as well as New Age philosophies, have used practices such as prayer, music, dance, singing, chanting, poetry, writing, sports and martial arts. These practices have various functions, such as health or aesthetic satisfaction, but they may also link[citation needed] to &quot;final goals&quot; of personal development such as discovering the meaning of life or living good life (compare philosophy). Michel Foucault describes in Care of the Self the techniques of epimelia used in ancient Greece and Rome, which included dieting, exercise, sexual abstinence, contemplation, prayer and confession some of which also became important practices within different branches of Christianity.
<br /><br />In yoga, a discipline originating in India, possibly over 3000 years ago, personal-development techniques include meditation, rhythmic breathing, stretching and postures. Wushu and T'ai chi ch'uan utilise traditional Chinese techniques, including breathing and energy exercises, meditation, martial arts, as well as practices linked to traditional Chinese medicine, such as dieting, massage and acupuncture.
<br /><br />In Islam, which arose almost 1500 years ago in the Middle East, personal development techniques include ritual prayer, recitation of the Qur'an, pilgrimage, fasting and takiah (purification of the soul).
<br /><br />Two individual ancient philosophers stand out as major sources[citation needed] of what has become personal development in the 21st century, representing a Western tradition and an East Asian tradition. Elsewhere anonymous founders of schools of self-development appear endemic - note the traditions of the Indian subcontinent in this regard.
<br />South Asian traditions
<br />Some ancient Indians aspired to &quot;beingness, wisdom and happiness&quot;.
<br /><br />Aristotle and the Western tradition:
<br />The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) influenced theories of personal development in the West. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defined personal development as a category of phronesis or practical wisdom, where the practice of virtues leads to eudaimonia, commonly translated as &quot;happiness&quot; but more accurately understood as “human flourishing” or “living well&quot;.[8] Aristotle continues to influence the Western concept of personal development to this day, particularly in the economics of human development and in positive psychology.
<br /><br />Confucius and the East Asian tradition:
<br />In Chinese tradition, Confucius (around 551 BC – 479 BC) founded an ongoing philosophy. His ideas continue to influence family values, education and management in China and East Asia. In his Great Learning Confucius wrote:
<br />&quot;The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the kingdom, first ordered well their
<br />own states. Wishing to order well their states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate
<br />their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their persons, they first rectified
<br />their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to
<br />be sincere in their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of
<br />knowledge lay in the investigation of things&quot;.
<br /><br />Personal development in psychology:
<br />Psychology became linked to personal development, not with the psychoanalysis of Freud (1856–1939) but starting with his contemporaries Alfred Adler (1870–1937) and Carl Jung (1875–1961). Adler refused to limit psychology to analysis, making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences. He also originated the concepts of lifestyle (1929 — he defined &quot;lifestyle&quot; as an individual's characteristic approach to life, in facing problems) and of self image[citation needed], a concept that influenced management under the heading of work-life balance.
<br /><br />Carl Gustav Jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of individuation, which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the Self. Daniel Levinson (1920–1994) developed Jung's early concept of &quot;life stages&quot;.  Levinson proposed that personal development come under the influence — throughout life — of aspirations, which he called &quot;the Dream&quot;: 
<br /><br />Whatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out. It makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life
<br />structure is consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it. If the Dream remains
<br />unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose.
<br /><br />Levinson's model of seven life-stages has been considerably modified due to sociological changes in the
<br />life cycle. Research on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by Albert Bandura (born 1925), suggested that self efficacy best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results.
<br />According to Bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because:
<br />1. it makes you expect to succeed
<br />2. it allows you take risks and set challenging goals
<br />3. it helps you keep trying if at first you don??t succeed
<br />4. it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough

		<document id="3f1f3d1cf76bc69cdad133a5ad2efd1e" url=""><![CDATA[Personal Development (Part Three)<br/><br/>In 1998 Martin Seligman won election to a one-year term as President of the American Psychological Association and proposed a new focus: on healthy individuals rather than on pathology:
<br /><br />We have discovered that there is a set of human strengths that are the most likely buffers against
<br />mental illness: courage, optimism, interpersonal skill, work ethic, hope, honesty and perseverance.
<br />Much of the task of prevention will be to create a science of human strength whose mission will be to
<br />foster these virtues in young people.
<br /><br />Personal development in higher education:
<br />Personal development has been at the heart of education in the West in the form of the Greek
<br />philosophers; and in the East with Confucius. Some people emphasize personal development as a
<br />part of higher education. Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin in 1810, made a statement interpretable as referring to personal development: &quot;...if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual, it is precisely education, whose object it is to develop the individual&quot;.
<br /><br />During the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on American campuses led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students. Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal development for young adults during their undergraduate years:
<br /><br />1. developing competence
<br />2. managing emotions
<br />3. achieving autonomy and interdependence
<br />4. developing mature interpersonal relationships
<br />5. establishing identity
<br />6. developing purpose
<br />7. developing integrity
<br /><br />In the UK, personal development took a central place in university policy in 1997 when the Dearing Report declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal
<br />development. In 2001 a Quality Assessment Agency for UK universities produced guidelines for
<br />universities to enhance personal development as:
<br /><br />* A structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning,
<br />  performance and / or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development;
<br />* Objectives related explicitly to student development; to improve the capacity of students to understand
<br />  what and how they are learning, and to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning 
<br /><br />In the 1990s, business schools began to set up specific personal-development programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the European Foundation for Management Development set up the Equis accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships, working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs.
<br />The first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a
<br />partnership between Metizo, a personal-development consulting firm, and the Euromed Management School in Marseilles: students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies.
<br /><br />As an academic department personal development has become a specific discipline, usually associated with business schools. As an area of research, personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines:
<br /><br />*    Education for questions of learning and assessment
<br />*    Psychology for motivation and personality
<br />*    Sociology for identity and social networks
<br />*    Economics for human capital and economic value
<br />*    Philosophy for ethics and self-reflection
<br /><br />Personal development in the workplace:
<br />Abraham Maslow (1908–1970), proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top, defined as: &quot;... the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming&quot;.  Since Maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people self-actualize — he estimated one percent — his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid, while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees.
<br /><br />As organizations and labor markets became more global, responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individual. In 1999 management thinker Peter Drucker wrote in the Harvard Business Review: &quot;We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: if you've got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out. But with opportunity comes
<br />responsibility. Companies today aren't managing their employees' careers; knowledge workers must,
<br />effectively, be their own chief executive officers. It's up to you to carve out your place, to know when
<br />to change course, and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some
<br />50 years.
<br /><br />Management professors Sumantra Ghoshal of the London Business School and Christopher Bartlett of the Harvard Business School wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract. On the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value: &quot;market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative, creativity and skills of all employees&quot;.
<br /><br />On the other hand, employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and &quot;... embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development&quot;.
<br /><br />The 1997 publication of Ghoshal's and Bartlett's Individualized Corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies, to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities. Another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women's careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men. The 2007 study of women's careers by Sylvia Ann Hewlett Off-Ramps and On-Ramps had a major impact on the way companies view careers.  Further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by Herminia Ibarra in her Working Identity on the relationship with career change and identity change, indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life.
<br /><br />Personal development programs in companies fall into two categories: the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies.
<br /><br />Employee benefits have the purpose of improving satisfaction, motivation and loyalty. Employee
<br />surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs, preferences and problems, and they use the results to design benefits programs. Typical programs in this category include:
<br /><br />*     Work-life balance
<br />*     Time management
<br />*     Stress management
<br />*     Health programs
<br />*     Counseling
<br /><br />Many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work: yoga, sports, martial arts, money-management, positive psychology, NLP, etc.
<br />As an investment, personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving
<br />productivity, innovation or quality. Proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization's strategic development goals. Employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee, usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires, perceived high-potential employees, perceived key employees, sales staff, research staff and perceived future leaders. Organizations may also offer other (non-investment-oriented) programs to many or even all employees. Typical programs focus on career development, personal effectiveness, teamwork, and competency-development. Personal development also forms an element in management tools such as personal development planning, assessing one's level of ability using a competency grid, or getting feedback from a 360 questionnaire filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization.
<br /><br />At this point, it will be fundamental to ask you: &quot; Having read through the three parts of this extract is: 'What are you doing about your personal development?'&quot;

But if it overwhelms you, start with just these two simple rules and you'll be on your way to financial independence.  When it comes to the way we think about money, I've noticed there are two kinds of people: those who think $1,000 is a lot of money, and those who think $10 is a lot of money.  I fall into the second category. 
<br /><br />But I'm not especially frugal. I have a fairly nice car, I take a vacation every year, and it isn't too hard to convince me to drop a few hundred dollars on a great pair of shoes now and then. I've never even clipped a coupon. But I've also maxed out my retirement savings, bought a house, and live without debt — all on an average salary for where I live.  What I am sharing with you isn't extraordinary, but it does seem somewhat rare. That said, I think most people can accomplish this fairly easily. All you have to do is live and die by two simple rules:
<br /><br />1. Pay Yourself First (The Best Kind of Cliché): &quot;Pay yourself first&quot; is a very common piece of financial advice. It's simple enough to follow, but that doesn't make it easy.  If you can save $200 per month at a 6-percent interest rate, you'll have more than $200,000 in 30 years. At the very least, you'll have a great savings fund at the ready for whatever life may bring. But how can you come up with that cash when you barely have any money left between paychecks?  The answer is to take that money off the top. And yes, it'll sting a bit at first.  I've made a habit of taking contributions to my retirement and savings account right off the top of each paycheck on the very day it hits my bank account. I try to cut pretty deep too, leaving myself just a little more than I need to pay for expenses. 
<br /><br />This works on two levels: It forces me to really budget to meet my basic expenses while keeping extra cash out of easy reach. I can still retrieve the money from my savings account if I happen to need it, but because I have to make a decision to transfer funds, they usually stay put. I allow myself to spend whatever I don't need for expenses on
<br />whatever I like — if I don't spend it by the time my next paycheck comes, I roll that into savings too.
<br /><br />I also save any additional money I get. I think a raise, tax return, or bonus can go two ways. It can raise your standard of living, or it can raise your standards. Rather than creating more expenses to suck up these extra dollars, I live the same way day to day and tuck the extra money away for something better.

		<document id="ca365fd5a9a7af62bdef0837cf07d42" url=""><![CDATA[The Only Financial Rules You Need To Live By (Part Two)<br/><br/>By way of a reminder, I mentioned in part one that the first simple financial rule to live by is to &quot;Pay yourself first&quot;.  This principle as simple as it seems is the bridge between where you are today and where you want to be.
<br /><br />The second rule is:
<br />Practice Mindful Spending: Having some leeway in your paycheck isn't a given, but I think many people have more wiggle room than they realize.  This is what I mean when I say that I think N100 is a lot of money. When I decide to buy something, it's a decision, not an impulse buy. I want to spend my money on things that really have value for me, not just things that are convenient or appealing at the moment.
<br />So while I can buy something nice once in a while — without guilt — I have a hard time going out for lunch or buying (you can guess what).  Less expensive purchases are an easy mental hurdle to get over because they're so small it seems that they could hardly amount to anything. The truth is, these seemingly insignificant purchases can easily amount to, or exceed, that N20,000 you may be aiming to
<br />save for a project.
<br /><br />If you spend N100 every morning on a Bread/Beans (Tea, Pap etc), and N150 each work day for lunch, this adds up to N1,250 per week (of five days) — for a grand total of N65,000 per year (of 52 weeks). If you earn N70,000 per year, that's a full month of your salary. Do you really want all that money to amount to a bunch of coffee and Subway sandwiches?  This isn't to say that no one should ever buy and eat food. But if I spend this kind of money every week and month, I won't have anything to devote to my savings. That's a sign that these seemingly small indulgences just aren't affordable, at least for now.  Consider what you spend on ground nut, suya delicacies, boiled egg, sweet, chocolate, coca cola etc every month (you may be amazed at the figures that will hit your eyes. 
<br /><br />This is why I've also decided not to opt for cable TV or an extensive cell phone plan. I don't feel that I live like a pauper. After all,I have money saved that I can turn to not only in an emergency, but also to pay for things that I feel really add enjoyment to my life, rather than just distracting me for a few hours or days — and steadily subtracting dollars from my bank account.
<br /><br />What Are Your Rules?
<br />Over time, I've learned to save money as diligently as I pay my bills. I also try to spend what's left as mindfully as I can. I can't say I always succeed, that I never overspend or that I'm not often tempted to break my rules.  Nevertheless, I'm sticking to the strategy that has kept me out of debt, and helped me
<br />save enough to meet some key financial goals — and still have some fun. I know of other people who've done even better by employing these rules much more stringently than I do. As for me, I'll keep saving up for my next big purchase by keeping all the little ones in check.
<br /><br />My advice:
<br />1.  It is possible to be financially free; and the two steps mentioned in this write up is the first ladder in the
<br />     process.
<br />2.  Failure to have a financial plan means you are not in any way planning to succeed financially.
<br />3.  What is your financial plan?
<br />4.  If you do not have any financial plan, then you had better adopt this two simple rules which spiced up
<br />     with a little discipline will set apart from the crowd in no distant time.

<br />1.  To live a wealthy life style without stealing or defrauding others, your goal must be to:
<br />     *  Earn income
<br />     *  Save a part of your income (10% only)
<br />     *  Invest your savings safely and wisely over a long term period
<br /><br />Note that the home truth here is: your daily choices and decisions determine your wealth as it determines:
<br />-  The information you get
<br />-  The habits you cultivates
<br />-  The discipline you maintain
<br /><br />Aim to be a passive investor but you must understand that money grows by the principles of compound interest and not simple interest.  That is why that N10, 000.00 you have today if invest in a place that gives an averages returns on investment of 35% passively every year after a period of 25 years will become:
<br /><br />18 million naira.
<br /><br />Don't get scared as it is real and you can do it for yourself without really giving anyone your money to get it done for you.  Think about this especially as others around are spending lavishly in the spirit of the season.  That N10,000.00 you want to use in buying a shoe, could be N18m in 25 years time.

<br /><br />With that done, now I will want us to reflect on some of the issues that have kept me away for this long. These are issues that bother on how far anyone out there can go this year: the issues are what I call the wheel of success - discipline, diligence and sacrifice.
<br /><br />Discipline: This is the ability to motivate oneself in spite of a negative emotional state. It is the systematic instruction given to train oneself on morals, a craft or trade; or following a particular code of conduct or &quot;order&quot; in achieving an assignment. Discipline enforces order – that is, ensures instructions are carried out.  The qualities associated with self-discipline include willpower, hard work, and persistence.  Quoting the words of our beloved father, Bishop David O. Oyedepo: &quot;prayer is helpless when it comes to taking you to the place of leadership; rather pray for the grace to give leadership all it takes, grace to stay discipline as long as it take and grace to give it the diligence it requires backed up by the desired sacrifice&quot;.
<br /><br />A combination of Godly character and capacity automatically makes you a leader that even the devil cannot stop (that is a total commitment to godly character and a commitment to continuous capacity building).
<br /><br />Diligence: This is how much time you work or put into your endeavour.  The amount of time you put into your own work determines your ultimate worth!  It is only those who work hard become successful (remember that it is what you put into a Computer that it gives out to you).  The value in you cannot manifest without it demanding a cost on you (the more you refine gold, the purer it becomes). Hard work does not kill!
<br /><br />Sacrifice: Is going the extra mile in your discipline; paying the extra price in your diligence and taking the extra step to deliver on your mandate. This can not be substituted with anything; this means it is either you are sacrificing of you are not.  Invest your time to create the future you desire.
<br /><br />The measure of these virtues you imbibe or drink determine how far you will go in life.  let's take a step further it determines the choices you will make in life and the information and the quality of peers that can or may hank out with you.
<br /><br />My earnest wish is that as you read this extract, yo will take a decision to build upon this virtues this year.
<br /><br />God bless you.

<br /><br />The solar system is governed by certain laws to maintain perfect harmony and beauty. Without this order, there would be utter chaos. Discipline is a basic requirement of a civilized society. Citizens of a disciplined nation work with a spirit of cooperation and unity. Aristotle has rightly said, &quot;Discipline is obedience to rules formed by the society for the good of all.
<br /><br />Discipline should be inculcated from a very young age. Talent and genius alone are not enough to achieve success. Discipline has an equally important role to play. Talents blossom in a disciplined person.
<br /><br />Liberty is highly cherished and mush valued privilege in our society. But absolute liberty is not possible. Discipline involves a restraint on liberty, which is necessary for the interest of society. Discipline has been found necessary for both individual and social welfare. Discipline and restraint were deemed essential in prehistoric time also and as society has become more and more complex, the urgency and importance of discipline has been felt all the more.
<br /><br />Discipline is not only desirable but indispensable. Wherever discipline and regulation of human conduct are absent, moral and material deterioration has set in. Absence of discipline means decay. To prevent decay, discipline has to be imposed in the common interest and for the common good.
<br /><br />The importance of discipline in educational institutions is well recognized. There should be a proper balance between discipline and the freedom of the students. The educational institutions should have a peaceful and calm atmosphere to enable the students to acquire knowledge. There is growing discontentment among the students. Because of this discontentment, we notice that discipline in our schools and colleges has considerably declined. Students are disrespectful to their teachers. They misbehave in the classrooms. They organize strikes and take the law into their hands. The government as well as the educational authorities should undertake necessary steps to improve the atmosphere in the educational institutions.
<br /><br />Discipline in schools may reduce the violence and vandalism and help the students to focus better on their studies and career. Discipline is important even in the family. Parents must raise their children in a pleasant and disciplined atmosphere. They should teach them the right values. They should themselves lead an orderly life so that their children can learn from their example. Children growing in disciplined and happy homes become responsible adults.
<br /><br />The strength of a nations lies in discipline. discipline helps the nation to make progress, fight external invasions and maintain unity. The Government makes laws to maintain law and order in the country. The laws are enforced to discipline the citizens and to maintain peace and harmony in the country. History has shown that dictators are firmly opposed to the grant of basic rights and liberties to the people. They want blind, unflinching obedience. That was Hitler's technique in Nazi Germany and Mussolini's technique in Italy. They thought that discipline was very necessary for nation to develop.
<br /><br />Discipline is the lifeline of the military departments. That armed forces follow a certain code of conduct. It demands loyalty to the country and to superior officers. It demands a spirit of fellowship and readiness to cope with an emergency. It is the duty of a solider to obey the orders of his commander. No army can put up a brave front against the enemy if it lacks discipline.
<br /><br />Discipline is very important in the social and political life of a nation. In many government offices, one can see that work is done in an irresponsible manner. Things will improve if the employees do their duty with dedication. This will happen if impose self-discipline.
<br /><br />People create chaos in public places by their undisciplined behavior. They show lack of order and manners while boarding buses and trains. Eve-teasing is another example of irresponsible behavior on the part of our youth. The rising crime graph in the country is due to the lack of discipline.
<br /><br />Members of political parties should follow a certain code of ethics. They should always act in a disciplined manner. In the past, leaders fought for freedom and now our leaders have the freedom to fight among themselves. The direct telecast of Parliamentary Session in doordarshan gives us the picture of the unruly behavior of our respected Parliamentarians inside the Parliament. The common man has started losing faith in political parties and the system. Steps should be taken to improve its image.
<br /><br />Without discipline there can be no scientific advances, no industrial or technological achievement, no settled system of law, no exploration and no development. Discipline is essential for personal growth and national prosperity. Absence of it can lead to failure, defeat and backwardness. Respect of parents, teachers and elders should be given importance. Honesty and integrity and doing a duty with devotion and dedication should be stressed. There should be a spirit of harmony, co-operation and mutual respect co-existent among fellow human beings. All should follow the rules and regulations laid by law. Discipline means full realization of the sense of responsibility. This will bring progress and prosperity in the society and the nation. A proper and reasonable balance has to be stuck between liberty and discipline. The restraints or discipline must course be designed for the social good and it is obvious that excessive restraints will inevitably lead to the erosion of human liberties.
<br /><br />Those who describe law as restraints on liberty and hostile to individual freedom apparently fail to understand the true concept of liberty and discipline. It is the State which acts thought laws that ensures justice and equality of opportunity to all. So it is true to say that discipline ensures justice and fair play.
<br /><br />Should we still blame our government (Nigerian Government) for deciding to run very fast on the path of discipline - for the general good of our populace.  Understand that the strength of the whole is a function of the strength of the unit - thus my simple question is: &quot;how disciplined are you?&quot;.

No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from the ropes they were tied to but for some reason, they did not. My friend saw a trainer nearby and asked why these beautiful, magnificent animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away.
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it's enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.&quot; My friend was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn't, they were stuck right where they were.
<br /><br />Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before? So make an attempt to grow further.... Why shouldn't we try it again?
<br /><br />Your attempt may fail, but never fail to make an attempt &amp; CHOOSE not to accept the false boundaries and limitations created by the past...

But a close look at the account in the scriptures in Mark 10:17 - 31 reveal to us that Jesus actually invited a 13th disciple who got depressed with the condition for discipleship and in the words of the scriptures: '... looked sad and went away sorrowful ...'.
<br /><br />This situation brings to our mind the fundamental importance of purpose in life.  Purpose is: a resolution, determination, intention or something one is set out to attain in life.  Our character in Mark 10 had obeyed all the commandments and his heart yearned for more in the pursuit of excellence and service to God; in this quest he encountered Jesus Christ who gave him the simple remedy to the yearning of his heart which is to go:
<br /><br />-  Maintain the statuesque
<br />-  Sell everything that he has
<br />-  Come and follow me (Jesus Christ)
<br /><br />Amazingly he backed out on this demand not because he was rich but because he did not understand the purpose for his existence - to fear God and live for him. With this ignorance of purpose came the lack of understanding of the fact that God is capable of giving him back all that He was asking him to give to the poor (verses 27 - 30).  Remember also that he that gives to the poor lends to God and ultimately the natural law of sowing and reaping will always run its course: '.. what a man sows, he will reap..' (Gal. 6:7).
<br /><br />If he had understood this, he would have willingly given out what he had knowing that the person asking him to so do will give it back to him (Mark 10:29 - 30); and maybe we would have been talking about the thirteen disciples of Christ and not twelve.
<br /><br />The lessons for us here is:
<br /><br />Except we understand the purpose of our existence, there are certain things that we will keep struggling with not because doing are difficult but because we need a paradigm shift in order to understand we need to do them.  Also there are so mistakes we eventually make in life not because we are not on the right path but because our purpose is not defined (when purpose is not known or defined, abuse is inevitable).  Ask yourself: 'what have I lost because my purpose in life was not defined?'
<br /><br />If you sincerely answer that, I want to announce to you that Jesus Christ is very willing to give a second chance to make it up if you will be willing to allow His spirit guide you through it.  Do not miss this opportunity of leaving a legacy that posterity with identify with.

<br />TEXT:  Mark 10:17 - 31
<br />Introduction: By way of introduction, let us define the following words from our topic:
<br />•	Youth: The definition of the word ‘youth’ is relative as there is no clear cut definition to it.  Here are some of the definitions rendered to it:
<br />-	‘The time of life when a person is young’ (when one is not yet old).
<br />-	‘One within the ages of puberty and 45years old.
<br />•	Life: This is defined by the advanced Learners dictionary as the quality to breathe, grow, reproduce etc.  
<br />•	Purpose: The intention, aim or intention of a thing.
<br />From the foregoing therefore a ‘Purpose driven life’ simply means a life that is literally lived on purpose economically, Psychologically, socially, politically, emotionally, educationally, career pursuit etc (that is a live that is lived with an aim, intention, reason, principle etc).  The question here then is: “What is the purpose of your existence?”  To understand the purpose of a product, you must work at understand first the product (anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a want or a need – it could be a physical good or service).  Let us x-ray the Christian as a product:
<br />A.	Nature:
<br />-	Molded after God (Gen. 1:27, Psalms 82:6)
<br />-	You are fearfully and wonderfully made (Psalm 139:14)
<br />B.	Created for:
<br />-	Fashioned to fear and do the will of God (Eccl. 12:13, Deut. 10:12, Luke 10:27)
<br />-	Make God’s kingdom your primary concern (Matt. 6:33)
<br />-	Fulfill the volume of books written concerning you (Heb. 10:7)
<br />C.	Search out your call
<br />-	 What you want and delight in as a Christian is important (Jn. 5:21, Mark 10:17 - 31)
<br />-	Consult and confirm what you want (Jn. 5:30; Cf Jn. 5:21)
<br />-	God’s leadership (Ps. 16:11a; 119:105, Prov. 3:6; 16:3; 16:9; 21:29<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />a.	Pitfalls in searching:
<br />?	When you don’t understand divine laws, you struggle to obey God (Mk10:21 Cf. I Tim. 6:17-19, Gal. 6:7)
<br />?	Where purpose is not known; abuse is inevitable.
<br />?	Lack of vision (Prov. 29:18). Purpose is the child of vision. You cannot pursue a goal until you see it; and you cannot achieve what you don’t pursue. (Note: When you deviate from purpose; you don’t only destroy yourself but all around you)
<br />b.	How to search out:
<br />i.	God’s express revelation (Joseph [Gen. 37:9], Chiemela):
<br />?	Ministration in your heart
<br />?	Dream
<br />?	Trance
<br />?	Second party ministration
<br /><br />ii.	Research 
<br />iii.	Mentorship
<br />iv.	Desire/Hunger/passion (David – I Sam. 17:26; Mk. 10:20 - 22)
<br />v.	Your skill set 
<br />D.	God’s productivity concept:
<br />1.	Get busy (2 Thessalonians 3:10)
<br />2.	Be a hard worker (Prov. 22:29)
<br />(This is critical because God blesses the works of our hands thus whatever your hand finds to do; do it well)
<br />3.	Be creative and under study another successful Christian doing what you want to do so that we can:
<br />?	Learn from his successes
<br />?	Learn from his failures
<br />?	Replicate what he did to get the success he has
<br />4.	Success is driven on the tripartite wheel of discipline, diligence and sacrifice. 
<br /><br />Discipline: This is the systematic instruction to a person intended to enable him follow a particular code of conduct or order.
<br /><br />Diligence: How much time you work on your own determines your ultimate worth!  It is only hard workers who become great leaders (it is what you put into a trash that brings out the treasure in it).  The value in you cannot show up without it demanding a cost on you.
<br /><br />Sacrifice: There is no star without a scar.  Sacrifice is going the extra mile in your discipline; paying the extra price in your diligence and taking the extra step to deliver your mandate. Faith is not a substitute for sacrifice (this is the requirement of every kingdom star).  Invest your time to create the future you desire.
<br /><br />Note: This principle is so strong that “prayer is helpless when it comes to taking you to the place of greatness without them”. Instead of praying for greatness, rather pray for the grace to give greatness all it takes (grace to stay discipline as long as it take and the grace to give it the diligence requires backed up by the desired sacrifices to get results).
<br /><br />These are the set of values that so engages you that every other thing around you becomes insignificant and less worthy of your time.
<br /><br />a.	 How disciplined are you?
<br />b.	How much time do you spend in the front of a television watching: home videos, wrestling, football, video games, computer games etc?
<br />c.	How much time do you waste chatting on your mobile phone?
<br />-	 What does that chatting add to your overall goal and vision?
<br />d.	Facebook?  I would not talk of facebook and other social network media because they are draining my generation of their intellectual capabilities.
<br /><br />Get me right, I am not saying that all these are not good but consider the wise words of Paul the Apostle in I Corinthians 6:12 and 10:23.
<br /><br />5.	Strike the balance (Romans 12:11): there should be no difference between your vocation and the ministry; rather see your vocation as an extension of your ministry
<br /><br />CHARACTER	CAPACITY
<br />You need a commitment to Godly character.	Intellectual abilities (wisdom – acquisition &amp; intelligent application of acquired knowledge).
<br /><br />Character will keep you up when Capacity pull you up.	Though this is the chief requirement for leadership, lack of character will pull you down.
<br /><br />Until you pass the character test, you cannot succeed as a leader.	This is not delivered in any university but your personal effort gives you this.
<br /><br />Character is molded by the word of God and the work of the Holy Spirit in us.	The universities give you the basic requirement for pursuing your desire in your field (Benjamin Franklin and Michael Faraday respectively barely had two years of education but transformed their generation by a commitment to capacity development).
<br /><br />Schooling is periodic but training should be a life style; this is because it takes a lot of training to be relevant in the times (our competitive world today).
<br /><br />Where you are is immaterial as long as you invest in knowledge and stay committed to capacity development.
<br /><br />You cannot take the lead if you have not read anything in your field of endeavour or chosen profession. Never do anything on the basis of common sense but seek wisdom.
<br /><br />To achieve this, tell yourself the truth that time cannot be created and make the most of it. 
<br /><br />Your value for knowledge determines worth of your tomorrow.
<br /><br />Note: A combination of Godly character and capacity automatically makes you a leader that even the devil cannot stop (that is a total commitment to godly character and a commitment to continuous capacity building). 
<br /><br />It takes character and capacity to maximize your potentials as a leader.  How much of this cup you drink determines how far you will go (where you will find yourself tomorrow is made today).
<br /><br />Conclusion: Observe that our choices are critical in all these because they help to shape our tomorrow.  Not only do they shape our tomorrow, they also determine where we will be in life and how we will be there.
<br />Realize therefore as a Christian, that purposeful living is living our lives the way the Bible describes that we live (guided by the precepts, intent and objectives of God in everything we do).   God placed this demand on us because without purpose life becomes a meaningless drift to nowhere.
