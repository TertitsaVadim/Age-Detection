They produce a number of top of the line parts washers, and they have created some of the most efficient parts washers on the market. They offer both solvent degreasing and ultrasonic cleaning so you can choose the right one for you. <br /><br />The most popular of all of the Pero machines is the indomitable Pero R1. <br /><br />The Pero R1 <br /><br />The Pero R1 is a vapour degreasing plant that has been around for only three short years. In order to run, it only needs power, air, and water. It’s extremely efficient, and it features a fast throughput as well as a fast warm up time. <br /><br />In fact, this industrial parts washer only needs 60 minutes to get going, which is faster than other parts washers in the industry. Once it has warmed up this parts washer can process up to 20 loads in an hour. It only takes 3 minutes for the load to be completely cleaned! This machine also features automatic loading, which makes it even faster. With a maximum basket weight of 80 kg, the Pero R1 can process up to 1000 kg of parts per hour!<br /><br />This machine’s extreme efficiency has allowed some companies to even drop a shift, making the company more effective and efficient. In many cases, this machine can pay for itself in just a year and a half! <br /><br />In addition to all of this, the Pero R1 is also called the True Universal Machine. This means that you can use nearly every major type of solvent with it. For example, this industrial parts washer can accept chlorinated hydrocarbons, specially modified alcohols, and hydrocarbons. This machine also features an optional ultrasonic unit if you need ultrasonic cleaning. <br /><br />Working with Kumi Solutions <br /><br />If you want to learn more about the Pero R1, you should contact Kumi Solutions. This is a UK company that is located in Nuneaton. They are the sole UK agents for Pero, which means that they are the only company that sells Pero products in the UK.

For example, they have a number of machines that are similar to the R1 but that come in different sizes with different capacities. <br /><br />They also have a number of aqueous parts washers, which are useful in specific situations where the parts cannot be exposed to solvents. <br /><br />No matter what kind of industrial parts washer you think you need, you should contact Kumi Solutions about their parts washing demonstrations. They hold these demonstrations at their facility in Nuneaton. When you come to visit, you can see a variety of the different machines in action. This means that you can get first-hand experience and see how they really work. The best part is that you can bring your own dirty parts for the demonstration so that you can see how these machines will really work for you.
