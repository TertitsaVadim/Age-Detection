<br /><br />If we close our hearts for further hurt, we also move away from discovering new avenues of being alive. Living within our integrity and within chosen boundaries, is the closest pathway to living an authentic life with peaceful delights.

If we can understand what makes us angry, depressed, sad, lonely ... ; we can connect this to our life story and identify the themes and the patterns that repeat itself. By feeling the intensity of the emotion, without acting on it; we start the process of reconnecting with the true self. This is beginning of a process of healing.

It is true to their nature of impulsivity. They do not think before they act. Impulsively they jump in and enjoy. They live in the moment and they can often be seen as selfish.
<br /><br />In the same way loyal people can often be seen as rigid and boring or depressed because they tend too much to the needs of others and focus on doing what is right according to their values, society and other people’s expectations. Too much energy is focused on the relationship with the other and on pleasing other people to experience acceptance.
<br /><br />What then needs to be learned from this picture on relationships? 
<br /><br />We need a beautiful balance between boundaries and freedom.
<br /><br />Balance is about giving and taking in the same amount.
<br /><br />Balance is about flexibility.
<br /><br />Love is about giving without expecting anything back because you do it from your heart and in  that the self is fulfilled.
<br /><br />Too many rules can kill the soul and prevent you from being alive.
<br /><br />Acceptance and freedom of choice is the most valuable gift you can bring to the lives of those you love.
<br /><br />Disappointment happens. To love is to risk being hurt.
<br /><br />Never lose yourself in a relationship. Always remain the beautiful individual you are.
<br /><br />Find interdependence rather than being emotionally or financially dependent in a relationship;  or trying to be so independent that you lose the connection.
<br /><br />Don’t hold on too closely and don’t wander off too far. Our souls are interconnected like the wave and the shore, always in motion,  but unpredictable in its direction, place and time of connectedness…
<br /><br />Be yourself.
<br /><br />Expect nothing.
<br /><br />Give everything.
<br /><br />Forgive.
<br /><br />Love for the sake of loving.
<br /><br />Live.

<br /><br />We choose people to be our friends, our companions, our lover... Who they are and who we are is where the beauty of attraction blooms. We identify through sharing our likes, dislikes, values, personality traits and interests; our compatibility and our abilty to dance to the music playing. The life story of each person - the unconscious patterns from the past, the personality traits of our primary care givers and the unfulfilled needs of our childhood; all play a significant role in how the contours of our heart is revealed by the people we choose to share our lives with.
<br /><br />Very often we are driven by subconscious urges to repeat dysfunctional patterns from the past in our relationships. To identify these; read the book by Barbara de Angelis: Are you the one for me?

<br /><br />When facing this black hole experience with feelings of emptiness, loneliness and disconnectedness; man enters a spiritual crisis which is often characterized by restlessness, crossing boundaries you thought you never would and breaking free in extreme ways. This is the moment when humanness and divinity touches in man's search for intimacy and connectedness.
<br /><br />There is some truth in the sayings that the beloved is God, and that when we love God we are loving ourselves. I and Thou are one. (Matin Buber). To find spiritual connectedness, man needs a connection with the self in such a way that he/she feels fully alive, living their life's purpose, making a difference... This asks for creativity. According to Jeff Brown in his book &quot;Soulshaping&quot;; , these three dimensions of being: spirituality, sexuality and creativity; are the soul fires of every person, the true manifestation of our essential nature. We need to tend to these 3 soul-fires. Separating them causes distortion: 
<br /><br />sexuality without spirituality loses heart; 
<br />spirituality without sexuality loses fire; 
<br />either without creativity lose vitality. 
<br /><br />Creativity without both leads to manipulation and disconection from life.
<br /><br />Loss is a significant road to a deeper connection with the self and life in general. Through loss we can move into silence, introspective solitude  and eventually find meaning in our passion for living.
<br /><br />May you enter this space of personal growth and through psychotherapy as a supportive container, come to know yourself and rekindle your soul fires.

		<document id="50ecbd6a5bc7b2136e438263922726d0" url=""><![CDATA[Stories<br/><br/>We create a life story by our daily living and experiencing all aspects of life. The kind of questions we ask, the perceptions we form, the thoughts that linger on in our minds and the interactions we have with other people or animals or plants...etc, create the beauty or woundedness of our soul. In every person's life a time for solitude, silence and introspection is needed to understand the way you see the world that you live in which is only a picture of how you view yourself. To create... whether by stories, questions, art ... we all need to touch our heart's deepest yearning for the making of our soul.
<br /><br />The eyes through which you view the world, is also a picture of your own soul. If you view the world in only negatives, it is almost impossible to truly love yourself and be aware of the different colours. 
<br /><br />If you can integrate all aspects - shadow and light, also all polarities: freedom and bondage; dependency and independency...etc;  of your own life into the picture you are painting; you will discover that the shadows bring out the light and that every colour was necessary to create the beauty you can see now, even if it is not beautiful at all times or not beautiful for every one. What matters most, is how you choose to create the picture you want to see.

		<document id="c5a4cf8a524fdcd8e8a1e376f5b2eca4" url=""><![CDATA[Loss<br/><br/>The one thing none of us can ever escape, is change. With change there is also loss and gain. Entering the second half of life whether it starts at 35 years of age or 40 or 45 or if you're very blessed at 50... this time is for everyone a period of reflection and the experience of intense loss.
<br /><br />Sometimes we deal with these mid-life challenges feeling rock bottom and confused, questioning your choices of a career, a partner and your current circumstances and the way forward.  This is the process of letting go... Letting go of past failures and experiences, letting go of the ego and sometimes people that you hold dear for many years either through death, divorce or separation... We come to terms with who we really are, facing the true self in the most vulnerable state.  In this process our paths may cross with soul mates and we be uplifted, only to realize that we have to let go of them too once the time come to cross the boundary to a place where you have to be at ease with the commitments you have and the values you construct your life by. In the end we struggle to find the balance between our desires, needs, wants and on the other side; our responsibilities, and the moral codes we live by.  This is a time of conflict, questioning the meaning of it all and facing your own shadow and unresolved issues.
<br /><br />Aging is a process of slowing us down, breaking the strife for perfection, beauty, competition and being the best. We cannot fight this process of nature, we can only surrender and bath in the wisdom that comes with it.  This is the time to find connection and spiritual growth, but also the time to be alone and doing introspection. Sometimes we make new choices, create our lives in a different way...; sometimes we stay with what we know and surrender to what is...
<br /><br />There is no right and wrong choices; there is only the responsibility that comes with every turn-off and living with the consequences. If it means that you lose the one you love most; then feel the beauty of the memories and let the joy fill your soul, sparkle in its glory and then LET IT GO... Eventually all comes to an end...
