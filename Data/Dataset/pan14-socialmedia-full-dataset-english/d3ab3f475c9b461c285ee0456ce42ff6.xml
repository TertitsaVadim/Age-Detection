<br />Everybody needs a riot of their own
<br />Everybody needs to be something that they are not
<br />Everybody needs to go it alone
<br /><br />Because living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't be what you want to be
<br />Living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't see what you need to see
<br /><br />All the time spent hanging on to anything
<br />All the time spent knowing that they're wrong
<br />All the time wasted, stolen back, innocent
<br />You won't get a second more so move it along
<br /><br />Living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't be what you want to be
<br />Living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't see what you need to see
<br /><br />Wishing and hoping and thinking it's you
<br />That's got this all under control
<br />Never a minute has passed you all by
<br />When they haven1t invaded your soul
<br /><br />It1s not something you can hold
<br />It1s not something you own
<br />It's not something you can buy or steal
<br />You've got it when you're alone
<br /><br />Being free is a tragedy
<br />When you don't know yourself
<br />Being free is a tragedy
<br />When you don't know who you are
<br /><br />Living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't be what you want to be
<br />Living so free is a tragedy
<br />When you can't see what you need to see

<br />A little left of center now
<br />Reflect as I realize,
<br />That all I need is to find the middle pillar path to sit like thesun by a 
<br />Star in the sky and just be.
<br />Sinners, casting stones at me
<br /><br />I…I stand, not crawling, not falling down
<br />I…I bleed the demons that drag me down
<br />I…I stand, (for nothing),not crawling, (the center),not fallingdown
<br />(of calms within the eye)
<br />I…I’ll bleed, (for no one),the demons, (but myself),that pull medown
<br />(for me and no one else)
<br /><br />Goodbye, sunshine, I’ve put it out again, sad
<br />I’m over, personalities, conflicting, 
<br />I don’t need you, or anyone, but me,
<br />I’ll just be, living my own life,
<br />I feel my glowing center grow, infecting I feel alive,
<br />Shovel dirt over lime, 
<br />Plant it in myself to sit like a seed under covers of earth andjust be
<br />Sinners, pointing fingers at me
<br /><br />I…I stand, (for nothing),not crawling, (by myself),not fallingdown
<br />I…I bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that drag medown
<br />I…I stand, (for nothing),not crawling, (the center),not fallingdown
<br />(of calms within the eye)
<br />I…I’ll bleed, (for no one),the demons, (but myself),that pull medown
<br />(for me and no one else)
<br /><br />Come play kill.
<br />Refuse my body, refuse my shadow
<br />Stone cold will
<br />Refuse to lead this, refuse to follow
<br />Bitter pills
<br />Refuse to feed this, refuse to swallow, I’m fueled godless
<br /><br />Come play, come play
<br />Kill
<br />Just be, just be
<br /><br />I…I stand, (for nothing),not crawling, (by myself),not fallingdown
<br />I…I bleed, (for no one), the demons, (but myself), that drag medown
<br />I…I stand, (for nothing),not crawling, (the center),not fallingdown

<br />While you were busy building knowledge I was already right 
<br />I know a voice like yours is not a weapon at all 
<br />And even mine is not a chisel for a thickened skull 
<br />So you can chant your anthems to the deaf 
<br />And we can sit here and cry until there's nothing left 
<br />Or we can take our voices with our hands 
<br />Make like knives and make demands 
<br />We'll take our voices - with our hands 
<br />Make like knives - we'll make demands 
<br /><br />I'm burning bridges for the last time 
<br /><br />I'm breaking habits for the first time 
<br /><br />I saw my future today, it said I'm going away 
<br />But I still haven't sung the last line 
<br />On my way down.. 
<br />I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade 
<br />I'm not ready to die 
<br />And everyday of my life I can feel it getting harder to breathe 
<br />With every minute ticking by I'm getting ready to leave 
<br />I know a life like mine is not a reason to fret 
<br />But I've been busy making scars that you will never forget 
<br />If only thirty three years can save my life 
<br />I've had twenty three more to make things right 
<br />So when I'm taken to the sky and you're still here 
<br />You can clear your mind and dry your tears 
<br />When I'm taken home - and you're still here 
<br />Just clear your mind - dry your tears 
<br />I'm burning bridges for the last time 
<br />I'm breaking habits for the first time 
<br />I saw my future today, it said I'm going away 
<br />But I still haven't sung the last line. 
<br />On my way down.. 
<br />I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade 
<br />I'm not ready to die 
<br />When I'm taken home - and you're still here 
<br />Just clear your mind - dry your tears 
<br />We'll take our voices - with our hands 
<br />Make like knives - we'll make demands 
<br />I'm not ready to lay, not ready to fade 
<br />I'm not ready to die

<br />I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all.
<br />Where you are and how you feel.
<br />Put these lights off as these wheels
<br />keep rolling on and on. (and on and on and on...)
<br />Slow things down or speed them up.
<br />Not enough or way too much. (and on and on and on...)
<br />are you and I gone?
<br /><br />[Chorus:]
<br />And I can't make it on my own.
<br />(And I can't make it on my own.)
<br />Because my heart is in Ohio.
<br />So cut my wrists and black my eyes.
<br />(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
<br />So I can fall asleep tonight, or die.
<br />Because you kill me.
<br />You know you do, you kill me well.
<br />You like it too, and I can tell.
<br />You never stop until my final breath is gone.
<br /><br />Spare me just three last words.
<br />&quot;I love you&quot; is all she heard.
<br />I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever.

<br /><br />TRADUCCION
<br /><br />¡Eh! allí, sé es difícil de parecer no me preocupo en absoluto.
<br />Donde usted es y como usted siente.
<br />Aplazado estas luces como estas ruedas siguen siguiendo rodando y sobre. (y sin cesar y sobre ...) Hacen más lento cosas o los aceleran.
<br />No bastante o camino demasiado. ¿(y sin cesar y sobre ...) somos idos usted y yo?
<br /><br />[ Coro:] y no puedo hacerlo yo solo.
<br />( Y no puedo hacerlo yo solo.) como mi corazón es en Ohio.
<br />Tan cortan mis muñecas y negro mis ojos.
<br />( El corte mis muñecas y negro mis ojos) Entonces puedo dormirme esta noche, o morir.
<br />Como usted me mata.
<br />Usted sabe que usted hace, usted me mata bien.
<br />Le gusta esto también, y puedo contar.
<br />Usted nunca se para hasta que mi aliento final sea ido.
<br /><br />Ahórreme solamente(justo) tres últimas palabras.
<br />&quot; Le amo &quot; es todo que ella se enteró.
<br />Le esperaré, pero no puedo esperar siempre.
