They are kind, pretty or handsome,very good kissers and are really hot. They always fall in love with their closest friends and never understand why. They are very funny, outgoing and don't care what people think or say. They are very satisfying and love to please. Are best in bed. Are straight up WARRIORS when necessary. If you repost this and you have blue eyes you will have the best kiss sometime in the next 5 days.

<br />and it should make you think...
<br />- - - - -
<br />I know way too many really beautiful
<br />girls who think they don't look good... It hurts... because it's
<br />our fault, guys I mean. We make girls feel like they have
<br />to be perfect. You know what I mean, flat stomach, big boobs,
<br />round booty, long legs, sexy lips, and on top of all that,
<br />they have to dress like a whore, and be one as well... nobody can
<br />measure up to that... and it's not fair... because nobody should
<br />have to. The little imperfections are what make people special.
<br />If everyone was perfect the world would be so boring, variety is
<br />what makes life interesting. So guys, stop making girls have to
<br />live up to your, I'm sorry, our... deluded fantasy visions of
<br />perfection. Stop acting like boys and start being men... realize
<br />that women don't exist to fulfill our sexual desires. Stop talking
<br />to them solely to get with them, be nice to them because you want
<br />to be their friend, not because you want to hook up with them. Say
<br />nice things about them not to flatter them in hopes that you'll
<br />get some, but because you know they like to hear them. In short...
<br />we need to grow up and stop acting like freaking retarded little
<br />boys.
<br />- - - - - -
<br />girls who agree repost. and to the few guys who have balls
<br />and agree also repost it

<br />My life would be meaningless, losing every accomplishment under my belt
<br />Everything I worked hard for, the dedication and things I strived for
<br />Means nothing after you find the one, that you would truly die for
<br />The one that makes you realize what's really going on
<br />That the things around aren't for real, and so it's time to move on
<br />To hold your head and take a step, but don't look back, you might regret
<br />The things you've don't seem so bad because they're unknown and unseen
<br />But never the less the outcomes the same, they make you less of a human being
<br /><br />To change a life is a beautiful thing, to impact it in such a way
<br />That they realize life's not so bad and maybe even the time of day...
<br /><br />When you get caught up in your actions, it's hard to change your ways. It's not always easy or fun but you know it's something that has to be done. When you've gone past the point of being able to change yourself for you...then it's about time you find that someone else. And when you find that special someone who makes you want to change who you are just because...then you know you've found true love.

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...

<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands 
<br />I try to pull his hand away;

<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot 
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back 
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot; 
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun 
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight 
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot; 
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot; 
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last 
<br />He said I love you so much 
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat 
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;

<br />u.....you're
<br />heartless...for sure
<br /><br />One night a guy &amp; a girl were driving
<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;
<br /><br />1st: If u post this on a bulletin in 5
<br />minutes someone special will message
<br />or call you.

<br /><br />Statistically speaking, unless you are a total hermit, social retard, or ugly as a putrid bum... There's at least one person on your facebook that wants to date you or sleep with you.
<br /><br />So..... let's play &quot;friends w/ benefits&quot;
<br /><br />The rules are simple... If you want to date the person who posted this, send a message to their inbox, not a reply to this bulletin, saying &quot;I'm yours&quot;.
<br /><br />If you just want to sleep with them &amp; stay friends, send them a message that says &quot;I'd hit that&quot;.
<br /><br />SCARED?
<br /><br />THE TWIST IS IF YOU'VE READ THIS, YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN &amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your facebook who wants to date you, and maybe more who want to sleep with you.. haha...
<br /><br />SO... re-post as &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot;, as it doesn't matter if you're married, in a relationship, or single.. You opened it so you HAVE to repost it! A test of your bravery...&quot;
