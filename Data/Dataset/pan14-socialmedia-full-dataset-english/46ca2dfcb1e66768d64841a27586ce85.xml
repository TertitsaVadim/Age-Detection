<br /><br />Rob is a commercial saturation diver for Global Divers in Louisiana . He performs underwater repairs on offshore drilling rigs. 
<br /><br />Below is an E-mail he sent to his sister. She then sent it to radio station 103.2 on FM dial in Ft. Wayne , Indiana , who was sponsoring a worst job experience contest. Needless to say, she won. 
<br /><br />Hi Sue, Just another note from your bottom-dwelling brother. 
<br /><br />Last week I had a bad day at the office. I know you've been feeling down lately at work, so I thought I would share my dilemma with you to make you realize it's not so bad after all. 
<br /><br />Before I can tell you what happened to me, I first must bore you with a few technicalities of my job. 
<br /><br />As you know, my office lies at the bottom of the sea. I wear a suit to the office. It's a wet suit. This time of year the water is quite cool. So what we do to keep warm is this: We have a diesel powered industrial water heater. 
<br /><br />This $20,000 piece of equipment sucks the water out of the sea. It heats it to a delightful temperature. 
<br /><br />It then pumps it down to the diver through a garden hose, which is taped to the air hose. Now this sounds like a darn good plan, and I've used it several times with no complaints. 
<br /><br />What I do, when I get to the bottom and start working, is take the hose and stuff it down the back of my wet suit. This floods my whole suit with warm water. It's like working in a Jacuzzi. 
<br /><br />Everything was going well until all of a sudden, my butt started to itch. So, of course, I scratched it. This only made things worse. Within a few seconds my butt started to burn. 
<br /><br />I pulled the hose out from my back, but the damage was done. 
<br /><br />In agony I realized what had happened. 
<br /><br />The hot water machine had sucked up a jellyfish and pumped it into my suit. Now, since I don't have any hair on my back, the jellyfish couldn't stick to it However, the crack of my butt was not as fortunate. 
<br /><br />When I scratched what I thought was an itch, I was actually grinding the jellyfish into the crack of my butt. 
<br /><br />I informed the dive supervisor of my dilemma over the communicator. His instructions were unclear due to the fact that he, along with five other divers, were all laughing hysterically. 
<br /><br />Needless to say I aborted the dive. I was instructed to make three agonizing in-water decompression stops totaling thirty-five minutes before I could reach the surface to begin my chamber dry decompression. When I arrived at the surface, I was wearing nothing but my brass helmet. 
<br /><br />As I climbed out of the water, the medic, with tears of laughter running down his face, handed me a tube of cream and told me to rub it on my butt as soon as I got in the chamber. 
<br /><br />The cream put the fire out, but I couldn't poop for two days because my butt was swollen shut. 
<br /><br />So, next time you're having a bad day at work, think about how much worse it would be if you had a jellyfish shoved up your butt. 
<br /><br />Now repeat to yourself, 'I love my job, I love my job, I love my job.' 
<br /><br />Now whenever you have a bad day, ask yourself, is this a jellyfish bad day? 
<br /><br />May you NEVER have a jellyfish bad day.

<br /><br />I was feeling particularly sassy that day, because I had just come from a thrilling choir practice followed by a powerful prayer meeting, so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.
<br /><br />I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed.
<br /><br />It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus; because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed.
<br /><br />I found that LOTS of people love Jesus.  Why, while I was sitting there, the nice man behind started honking like crazy, and he leaned out of his 
<br />window and screamed, &quot;for the love of God, GO! GO!&quot;   What an exuberant cheerleader he was for the Lord.
<br /><br />Everyone started honking!  I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people.
<br /><br />I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love.  There must have been a man from Florida back there, because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.
<br /><br />I saw another man waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.  When I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat  what that meant, he said that it was an Hawaiian good luck sign or 
<br />something.
<br /><br />Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back.
<br /><br />My grandson burst out laughing; why even he was enjoying this religious experience.
<br /><br />A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me.
<br /><br />I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed.
<br /><br />So I waved to all my sisters and brothers, smiled at them all, and drove on through the intersection.
<br /><br />I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again, and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared, so I slowed the car down, leaned out 
<br />of the window, and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away.
<br /><br />Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!
<br /><br />Share Granny's letter with your friends
<br /><br />Love and Blessings,
