<br />Aggregate quarry crushing plant Working Principle
<br />Big materials are fed to the jaw crusher evenly and gradually by vibrating feeder through a hopper for primary crushing. After first crush, the material will transferred to impact crusher by belt conveyor for secondary crush; the crushed materials will then transferred to vibrating screen for separating. After separating, the parts that can meet standard will be transferred away as final products, while the other parts will be returned to impact crusher, thus forming a closed circuit. Size of final products can be combined and graded according to customer’s specific requirement. We can also equip dust catcher system to protect environment.

<br />Ballast crushing plant
<br />In the ballast crushing plant, good quality track ballast is made of crushed natural rock with particles between 28 mm and 50 mm in diameter. And angular stones are preferable to naturally rounded ones, as angular stones interlock with each other, inhibiting track movement. Soft materials such as limestone are not particularly suitable, as they tend to degrade under load when wet, causing deterioration of the line; granite, although expensive, is one of the best materials in this regard.

<br />A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw being fixed and the other being moved back and forth relative to it by a cam or pitman mechanism. The jaws are farther apart at the top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it’s small enough to escape from the bottom opening. The movement of the jaw can be quite little, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.

<br />&lt;p&gt;A gyratory crusher is one of the main kinds of major crushers in a quarry or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are selected in size either by the layer and gape height or by the size of the receiving starting. Gyratory crushers can be utilized for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the ending of the space between the mantle line (portable) mounted on the concave liners and the central vertical spindle (mounted) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The distance is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the main vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is absolve to turn around its axis. The crusher highlighted is a short-shaft suspended spindle variety, meaning that the eccentric is installed above the gear and that the main shaft is suspended at the top. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design where the unusual is mounted underneath the gear.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;The Crushing form of this series Jaw Crusher is driven-squeezing style. Its working principle is: Motor drives belt and belt pulley, makes moving jaw up and down through eccentric shaft. When the moving jaw is up, the angle between lining plate and moving jaw becomes large, and this will push moving jaw plate close to the fixed jaw plate. During this process, the material is crushed and ground, thus the crushing will be done. When the moving jaw is down, the angle between lining plate and moving jaw becomes small, the moving jaw plate will leave the fixed jaw plate on account of the effect of pulling bar and spring, and then the crushed material will be discharged from the lower opening of the crushing room.&lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;Rock and crushed Rock products mainly are processed by drilling and blasting, and then conveyed to for further processing operations. Techniques used for Rock extraction differ due to the property and location of the deposit. The rock and Rock processing may include crushing, grinding, screening, size classification, material handling and storage process. The screens separate large boulders from finer rocks that do not require primary crushing, thus reducing the load to the primary crusher. Jaw crusher, impact crusher, or gyratory crushers are usually used for primary crushing stage. The crushed particle sizes are normally 3 to 12 inches in diameter, and undersize material will be conveyed for re-crushing or used as coarse aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;
