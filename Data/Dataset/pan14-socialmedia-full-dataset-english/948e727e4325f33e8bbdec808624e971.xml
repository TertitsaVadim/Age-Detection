<br /><br />He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:
<br /><br />&quot;Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck.&quot; If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />To which his wife responds: &quot;He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!&quot;

<br /><br />The husband replies, &quot;That's no big thing in this day and age.&quot;
<br /><br />The wife continues, &quot;Yeah, I've been with one guy.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh yeah? Who was the guy?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Tiger Woods.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Tiger Woods, the golfer?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, he's rich, famous and handsome. I can see why you went to bed with him.&quot;
<br /><br />The husband and wife then make passionate love.
<br /><br />When they are done, the husband gets up and walks to the telephone.
<br /><br />&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asks the wife.
<br /><br />The husband says, &quot;I'm hungry, I was going to call room service and get something to eat.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Tiger wouldn't do that.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh yeah? What would Tiger do?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;He'd come back to bed and do it a second time.&quot;
<br /><br />The husband puts down the phone and goes back to bed to make love a second time.
<br /><br />When they finish, he gets up and goes over to the phone. &quot;Now what are you doing?&quot; she asks.
<br /><br />The husband says, &quot;I'm still hungry so I was going to get room service to get something to eat.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Tiger wouldn't do that.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh yeah? What would Tiger do?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;He'd come back to bed and do it again.&quot;
<br /><br />The guy slams down the phone, goes back to bed, and makes love one more time.
<br /><br />When they finish he's tired and beat. He drags himself over to the phone and starts to dial.
<br /><br />The wife asks, &quot;Are you calling room service?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No! I'm calling Tiger Woods, to find out what the par is for this damn hole.&quot;

She heard the train stop and her son said, &quot;All of you sons of bitches who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks.&quot;
<br /><br />The mother went nuts and told her son, &quot;We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language.&quot;
<br /><br />Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, &quot;All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon.&quot; She hears the little boy continue, &quot;For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today.&quot;
<br /><br />As the mother began to smile, the child added, &quot;For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the bitch in the kitchen.&quot;

She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.
<br /><br />&quot;Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?&quot;
<br />The blonde said, &quot;How about 50 dollars?&quot; The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, &quot;Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?&quot;
<br />The man replied, &quot;She should. She was standing on the porch.&quot;
<br /><br />A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.
<br />&quot;You're finished already?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; the blonde answered, &quot;and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. &quot;Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50. &quot;And by the way,&quot; the blonde added, &quot;that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari.&quot;

<br /><br />Every morning the old boy would wake up and give off an enormous fart, much to his long suffering wife's annoyance.
<br /><br />&quot;You'll fart your guts out one of these days,&quot; she always complained.
<br /><br />After a particularly bad week the wife decided to have her revenge and got up early, placing some turkey giblets in the bed next to the old boy's arse.
<br /><br />While making breakfast downstairs she heard his usual morning fart reverberate through the floorboards followed by a scream.
<br /><br />Twenty minutes later a rather shaken man came downstairs.
<br /><br />&quot;You was right all along Missus,&quot; the old man says, &quot;I finally did fart my guts out, but by the grace of God, and these two fingers, I managed to push 'em back in!&quot;

<br /><br />She offers him a handful of peanuts, which he gratefully munches up.

<br /><br />When she is about to hand him another batch again he asks her: &quot;Why don`t you eat the peanuts yourself?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;We can't chew them because we've no teeth&quot;, she replied.

<br /><br />Then, as the wife undressed, she asked, &quot;What are you thinking now?&quot;

<br /><br />One day an at home wife is alone and the doorbell rings.
<br /><br />She opens it to a guy, &quot;Hi, is Tony home?&quot;
<br /><br />The wife replies, &quot;No, he went to the store, but you can wait here if you want.&quot;
<br /><br />So they sit down and after a while of silence the friend says &quot;You know Sara, you have the greatest breasts I have ever seen. I'd give you a hundred buck just to see one.&quot;
<br /><br />Sara thinks about it for a second and figures, what the hell - a hundred bucks! She opens her robe and shows one to him for a few seconds. He promptly thanks her and throws a hundred bucks on the table. They sit there a while longer and guy then says &quot;That was so amazing I've got to see both of them. I'll give you another 100 dollars if I could just see the both of them together.&quot;
<br /><br />Sara amazed by the offer sits and thinks a bit about it and thinks, heck, why not? So she opens her robe and gives Chris a nice long chance to cop a look.
<br /><br />A while later Tony arrives back home from the store. The wife goes up to him, &quot;You know, your friend Chris came over.&quot;
<br /><br />Tony thinks about it for a second and says, &quot;Well did he drop off the 200 bucks he owes me?&quot;

<br />    The love song of the year
<br />    Close your eyes but don't forget
<br />    What you have heard
<br />    A man who's trying to say three words
<br />    The words that make me scared
<br /><br />A million love songs later
<br />    And here I am trying to tell you that I care
<br />    A million love songs later
<br />    And here I am
<br /><br />Looking to the future now
<br />    This is what I see
<br />    A million chances pass me by
<br />    A million chances to hold you
<br />    Take me back, take me back
<br />    To where I used to be
<br />    To hide away from all my truth
<br />    Through the light I see
<br /><br />A million love songs later
<br />    And here I am trying to tell you that I care
<br />    A million love songs later
<br />    And here I am

<br />just let you leave without a trace
<br />When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all
<br /><br />How can you just walk away from me,
<br />when all I can do is watch you leave
<br />'cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
<br />and even shared the tears
<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all
<br /><br />So take a look at me now,
<br />oh there's just an empty space
<br />And there's nothing left here to remind me,
<br />just the memory of your face
<br />Ooh take a look at me now,
<br />well there's just an empty space
<br />And you coming back to me is against all odds
<br />and that's what I've got to face
<br /><br />I wish I could just make you turn around,
<br />turn around and see me cry
<br />There's so much I need to say to you,
<br />so many reasons why
<br />You're the only one who really knew me at all
<br /><br />So take a look at me now,
<br />well there's just an empty space
<br />And there's nothing left here to remind me,
<br />just the memory of your face
<br />Now take a look at me now,
<br />'cause there's just an empty space
<br />But to wait for you, is all I can do
<br />and that's what I've got to face
<br /><br />Take a good look at me now,
<br />cos I'll still be standing here
<br />And you coming back to me is against all odds
<br />It's the chance I've gotta take
<br /><br />Take a look at me now
