It recognises our rights whilst still respecting the rights of others. It allows us to take responsibility for ourselves and our actions without judging or blaming other people. And it allows us to constructively confront and find a mutually satisfying solution where conflict exists.<br /><br />So why use assertive communication?<br /><br />All of us use assertive behaviour at times... quite often when we feel vulnerable or unsure of ourselves we may resort to submissive, manipulative or aggressive behaviour.<br /><br />Yet being trained in assertive communication actually increases the appropriate use of this sort of behaviour. It enables us to swap old behaviour patterns for a more positive approach to life. I've found that changing my response to others (be they work colleagues, clients or even my own family) can be exciting and stimulating.<br /><br />The advantages of assertive communication<br /><br />There are many advantages of assertive communication, most notably these:<br /><br />It helps us feel good about ourselves and others<br /><br />It leads to the development of mutual respect with others<br /><br />It increases our self-esteem<br /><br />It helps us achieve our goals<br /><br />It minimises hurting and alienating other people<br /><br />It reduces anxiety<br /><br />It protects us from being taken advantage of by others<br /><br />It enables us to make decisions and free choices in life<br /><br />It enables us to express, both verbally and non-verbally, a wide range of feelings and thoughts, both positive and negative<br /><br />There are, of course, disadvantages...<br /><br />Disadvantages of assertive communication<br /><br />Others may not approve of this style of communication, or may not approve of the views you express. Also, having a healthy regard for another person's rights means that you won't always get what YOU want. You may also find out that you were wrong about a viewpoint that you held. But most importantly, as mentioned earlier, it involves the risk that others may not understand and therefore not accept this style of communication.<br /><br />What assertive communication is not...<br /><br />Assertive communication is definately NOT a lifestyle! It's NOT a guarantee that you will get what you want. It's definately NOT an acceptable style of communication with everyone, but at least it's NOT being aggressive.<br /><br />But it IS about choice<br /><br />Four behavioural choices<br /><br />There are, as I see it, four choices you can make about which style of communication you can employ. These types are:<br /><br />direct aggression: bossy, arrogant, bulldozing, intolerant, opinionated, and overbearing<br /><br />indirect aggression: sarcastic, deceiving, ambiguous, insinuating, manipulative, and guilt-inducing<br /><br />submissive: wailing, moaning, helpless, passive, indecisive, and apologetic<br /><br />assertive: direct, honest, accepting, responsible, and spontaneous<br /><br />Characteristics of assertive communication<br /><br />There are six main characteristics of assertive communication. These are:<br /><br />eye contact: demonstrates interest, shows sincerity<br /><br />body posture: congruent body language will improve the significance of the message<br /><br />gestures: appropriate gestures help to add emphasis<br /><br />voice: a level, well modulated tone is more convincing and acceptable, and is not intimidating<br /><br />timing: use your judgement to maximise receptivity and impact<br /><br />content: how, where and when you choose to comment is probably more important than WHAT you say<br /><br />The importance of &quot;I&quot; statements<br /><br />Part of being assertive involves the ability to appropriately express your needs and feelings. You can accomplish this by using &quot;I&quot; statements. These indicate ownership, do not attribute blame, focuses on behaviour, identifies the effect of behaviour, is direcdt and honest, and contributes to the growth of your relationship with each other.<br /><br />Strong &quot;I&quot; statements have three specific elements:<br /><br />Behaviour<br /><br />Feeling<br /><br />Tangible effect (consequence to you)<br /><br />Example: &quot;I feel frustrated when you are late for meetings. I don't like having to repeat information.&quot;<br /><br />Six techniques for assertive communication<br /><br />There are six assertive techniques - let's look at each of them in turn.<br /><br />1. Behaviour Rehearsal: which is literally practising how you want to look and sound. It is a very useful technique when you first want to use &quot;I&quot; statements, as it helps dissipate any emotion associated with an experience and allows you to accurately identify the behaviour you wish to confront.<br /><br />2. Repeated Assertion (the 'broken record'): this technique allows you to feel comfortable by ignoring manipulative verbal side traps, argumentative baiting and irrelevant logic while sticking to your point. To most effectively use this technique use calm repetition, and say what you want and stay focused on the issue. You'll find that there is no need to rehearse this technique, and no need to 'hype yourself up' to deal with others.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />&quot;I would like to show you some of our products&quot;<br />&quot;No thank you, I'm not interested&quot;<br />&quot;I really have a great range to offer you&quot;<br />&quot;That may be true, but I'm not interested at the moment&quot;<br />&quot;Is there someone else here who would be interested?&quot;<br />&quot;I don't want any of these products&quot;<br />&quot;Okay, would you take this brochure and think about it?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes, I will take a brochure&quot;<br />&quot;Thank you&quot;<br />&quot;You're welcome&quot;<br /><br />3. Fogging: this technique allows you to receive criticism comfortably, without getting anxious or defensive, and without rewarding manipulative criticism. To do this you need to acknowledge the criticism, agree that there may be some truth to what they say, but remain the judge of your choice of action. An example of this could be, &quot;I agree that there are probably times when I don't give you answers to your questions.<br /><br />4. Negative enquiry: this technique seeks out criticism about yourself in close relationships by prompting the expression of honest, negative feelings to improve communication. To use if effectively you need to listen for critical comments, clarify your understanding of those criticisms, use the information if it will be helpful or ignore the information if it is manipulative. An example of this technique would be, &quot;So you think/believe that I am not interested?&quot;<br /><br />5. Negative assertion: this technique lets you look more comfortably at negatives in your own behaviour or personality without feeling defensive or anxious, this also reduces your critics' hostility. You should accept your errors or faults, but not apologise. Instead, tentatively and sympathetically agree with hostile criticism of your negative qualities. An example would be, &quot;Yes, you're right. I don't always listen closely to what you have to say.&quot;<br /><br />6. Workable compromise: when you feel that your self-respect is not in question, consider a workable compromise with the other person. You can always bargain for your material goals unless the compromise affects your personal feelings of self-respect. However, if the end goal involves a matter of your self-worth and self-respect, THERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISE. An example of this technique would be, &quot;I understand that you have a need to talk and I need to finish what I'm doing. So what about meeting in half an hour?&quot;<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Assertiveness is a useful communication tool. It's application is contextual and it's not appropriate to be assertive in all situations. Remember, your sudden use of assertiveness may be perceived as an act of aggression by others. I found that this page demonstrated this incredibly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Frowingmachinesreview.com%2Fqa-exercise-slimmer-defined-legs-esp-top%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://rowingmachinesreview.com/qa-exercise-slimmer-defined-legs-esp-top/</a>   web page.<br /><br />There's also no guarantee of success, even when you use assertive communication styles appropriately.<br /><br />&quot;Nothing on earth can stop the individual with the right mental attitude from achieving their goal; nothing on earth can help the individual with the wrong mental attitude&quot; W.W.

Fantastic! This means that you want to publish your manuscript. And I assume that you're wise enough to know that getting the manuscript edited professionally is critical. However, I'll be the first to tell you that getting a great, experienced editor that will treat your manuscript with care is a difficult task. So I have created 5 steps to help you get started.<br /><br />1) Should I get copy editing or proofreading?<br />Why not both? Some editors cost less for 'proofreading only' as opposed to content editing. The particular distinction is that proofreaders fix mistakes only, while copy editors make many more substantial modifications. I know that you think your book is perfect and also you don't want anybody to mess it up, but trust me...a book (especially one just completed, and doubly a first novel) needs a whole lot of tender loving and care. A fantastic editor will look for plot inconsistencies, poorly written dialog, lack of character motivation, chapters that don't move the plot forward, unusual word choice and more. Spending money on an editor who knows what they are doing is similar to getting a private writing tutor. You will get back a much stronger manuscript.<br /><br />2) Costs. Just how much should you pay for proofreading and editing?<br />Costs can vary considerably. It is based on length of the project, expertise of the editor or simply quality of the editing. Don't expect a cheap cost and never look for a 'deal'. With that being said, a lots of proofreaders overcharge. Shop for the most qualified editor who has dealt with similar projects before, and see if they fit in your 'budget'. Editing a novel is usually between $500 to $1500, however it's a great and much needed investment.<br /><br />3) Pick an editor with a background in literature<br />Many professional editors never studied English or editing. Find out what their background and credentials are. Some editors can very good at fixing mistakes and formatting, however can they recognize 'poor' writing and improve it? Is he/she themselves good writers? I found that this webmaster showed this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhometheaterpad.com%2F556%2Flogitech-5500-5-1-surround-sound-system-connection-issue-vaio-ar21-laptop%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hometheaterpad.com/556/logitech-5500-5-1-surround-sound-system-connection-issue-vaio-ar21-laptop/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />4) Look for a native speaker, from the country you want your book to be successful in. <br />Proof of address isn't any guarantee that they're a native speaker. There are a lot of people that are excellent at English, although not all English is actually the same. Several countries speak blends of English which is not the same as the US/Canadian English, which is also different from UK English. Generally, US English is international English.<br /><br />5) Where should you locate an editor?<br />First of all, search 'novel editing/edit my novel' in Google and see what comes up. Remember that the sites on the first page of Google are usually more established (have been around longer) and more expensive, but there are plenty of small companies with less advertising budget if you look past the first page results. I, personally had great experiences with smaller companies. Some of the companies are publishing companies as well that will also proofread and edit your book. This is the route I highly recommend.

It doesn't mean that you have to go to a gym as long as you provide your body with the right kind of resistance that it requires to add muscle. However, you need to understand there simply is no short cuts you can take to add muscle. There is no special diet, no special pill or fancy formula that's going to work. The only way to do it is to lift weights on a regular basis.<br /><br />If you lift dumb bells you will cause a dramatic effect on your muscles and their mass, so this can be a very good thing to add to your weight lifting program. No matter what kind of a body you have or how little muscle that you have at the time you start if you have a good dumb bell training program in place you are going to increase the size of your muscles.<br /><br />The first thing you need to do is to make a baseline where you want to start from. Make sure to pick an amount of weight that you can lift eight to ten times. These are the dumb bells exercises that you should include in this:<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bicep curls&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Shoulder presses&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Chest presses&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Triceps extensions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />The weight for each of these will need to vary and each one of these exercises will need their own weight baselines. So make sure that you figure this out before you go and start the program. I found that this site described this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RzbHJjYW1lcmFyZXZpZXdlci5jb20vZ29vZC1waWN0dXJlcy1uaWdodC1jbHViLw__" target="_blank">Shelba Placeres</a> weblog.<br /><br />Once you have your baselines for all of your exercises you should lift the baselines twice a week for about two weeks. You should do each set of exercises by doing three sets of eight to 10 reps for each exercise.<br /><br />After the two weeks you should gradually increase the weight for each exercise. Do the exact same thing with the new weight for another two weeks. As you increase the amount of weights, your strength is going to begin to increase as well, which means that you'll be able to lift heavier amounts each time. In order to continue to stimulate your muscles to grow, you will need to continue to increase the weight as much as your body can handle. Always doing the three sets of eight to ten reps each time for each exercise.<br /><br />As you continue this type of procedure you will begin to notice a difference in your muscles and once you get to where you want to be, you can then continue to do the exercises at the highest weight you reached in order to maintain your current muscle state.

In 93% of those 1 in 60, it will only ever happen once. In the unfortunate 7% it can recur at an average frequency of around 10 years.<br /><br />It is usually a temporary facial palsy condition, causing paralysis of one side of the face. In around 1% of cases, including my own, it can strike both sides of the face at the same time (bilateral bell's palsy) leaving a person with no facial expression whatsoever and in no uncertain terms, truly &quot;wiping the smile off your face&quot;.<br /><br />In 50% of cases all of the facial paralysis will disappear within 3 months. In 20% this will take up to 6 months and in another 10% it may take up to a year to achieve a complete recovery..&quot;And what becomes of the other 20%?&quot; I hear you shout...<br /><br />The healing of the seventh cranial nerve, also known as the facial nerve, can continue at the rate of about 0.5 - 1mm per day for up to around 18 months and some consultants would say up to 2 years.<br /><br />After this time, it may be necessary to employ the services of a professional facial muscle trainer to &quot;retrain&quot; your facial muscles to work in their originally intended way. This training can take the form of manual Bell's Palsy facial exercises or in some cases the use of an electrical stimulator, both of which can produce major improvements many years after the facial paralysis.<br /><br />There are other treatments such as Botox injections and decompression surgery, that some suggest can alleviate long term symptoms such as synkenisis. Synkenisis is best described as remnants of facial paralysis or incorrect rejuvenation of the facial nerve, resulting in movements that are contrary to what was intended. In practical terms this may show as the corners of your mouth raising upon the closing of your eyelids; this being just one of a great many possible scenarios.<br /><br />A number of medical consultants hold the belief that Bell's Palsy is an illness with no known cause. In fact there are over 50 different illnesses that can cause facial paralysis and it is only when these have been ruled out that a diagnosis of Bell's Palsy is comfortably arrived at. Thus it is known as an idiopathic facial palsy, meaning &quot;of unknown cause&quot;.<br /><br />The most prevalent medical belief however, is that it is the reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV 1) that is the cause of the illness. This is not the sexually transmitted herpes, this is the one that gives you the odd cold sore.<br /><br />It must also be said here that just because you get cold sores, that does not in any way whatsoever, mean that you will get Bell's Palsy. On the contrary, I have still never had a cold sore in my life and yet had bilateral Bell's Palsy. So, there is no more reason to worry about getting suddenly being stricken with Bell's palsy, than there is about losing another pound, dollar or euro on the weekly lottery.<br /><br />The herpes simplex virus is seldom of any medical importance and as stated, is most commonly associated with cold sores. Your immune system usually cures it extremely well if ever it tries to show up.<br /><br />Most of us do actually carry this virus around with us throughout our lives. 25% of people will never know they have it and never show any symptoms. 50% of people will have very mild symptoms at some point in life (not of Bell's Palsy) and 25% may be diagnosed with it upon showing some noticeable symptoms (but again, not Bell's Palsy).<br /><br />When we initially contracted the virus through normal human contact as a child we may have shown no significant symptoms at all. However, once contracted, the virus remains with us in a dormant state until it can be reactivated by some future event or when we are particularly run down and our immune system has been weakened.<br /><br />Without going into all of the medical terms, the resultant reactivation of the virus to cause &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbellspalsybook.allbellspalsy.info"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bellspalsybook.allbellspalsy.info</a>]Bell's Palsy[/url], means that the virus has been dormantly awaiting its moment of glory on our seventh cranial nerve and upon reactivation, causes it to inflame.<br /><br />The seventh cranial nerve, on its way to the facial muscles, passes through the fallopian canal, a thin bony conduit in the ear area. Because of the inflammation to the nerve, when it is in the fallopian canal it can only inflame so much before it is in effect, crushing itself.<br /><br />It is when this happens that the &quot;crushing&quot; effect stifles its ability to transmit the impulses that are required to activate the facial muscles and achieve facial expression and therefore, a paralysis of the facial expressions on the affected side are apparent.<br /><br />Now, that being the most prevalent theory, the herpes simplex virus has been noticed as present in 60-70% of those who are diagnosed with Bell's Palsy. As early as 1970, a study by researcher Shingo Murakami identified HSV-1 as the primary cause of Bell's palsy and several subsequent studies have consistently verified Murakami's research.<br /><br />So, if we accept all of the above theory as being correct (and I would like to ask the obvious question about the other 30 - 40% who did not have HSV-1 present) then it is the virus that has caused the actual inflammation but surely, to be able to reactivate in the first place it must have taken advantage of our physical state.<br /><br />If our immune system has been perfectly capable of keeping this virus at bay since we were a child, then what has and could, allow this virus to manifest its reactivation within us, in such a way as to cause an outbreak of this fashion.<br /><br />It is therefore, to our immune system that we must look for the answers.<br /><br />A perfectly healthy immune system would quite happily take care of this virus' control and restraint. Therefore it must follow that for it to break out of its cell (excuse the pun) and wreak havoc with our facial nerve, the alarm bells must draw us to the conclusion of a weak immune system at the time of the breakout.<br /><br />So what depletes the strength of our immune system?<br /><br />Our immune system is fuelled by the good foods and drink with which we nourish ourselves. It is aided by the sunshine and fresh air in which we bathe and breath and it is also strengthened by keeping our physical health in good order, our weight reasonable and by trying to keep a positive, calm and unworried mental outlook.<br /><br />Conversely, it is compromised by a lack of the aforementioned good fuels, by illness, stress, sugar (I kid you not) and by being generally run down.<br /><br />I myself, although not suffering from any illness prior to having bilateral Bell's Palsy, would definitely agree with the other components to making my immune system extremely low, stress being the main cause of each.<br /><br />I was working too hard in a thankless job whilst not looking after myself properly in the food department, due either a lack of self esteem, extreme tiredness, or a feeling that there was not enough time to devote to this eating pastime. All of which are symptomatic of being very stressed.<br /><br />The doctor who first diagnosed me, when I had only one side of my face paralysed, gave me a prescription which, on top of the medicinal components, advised total rest, relaxation and rejuvenation.<br /><br />Having the condition for over 4 years, I have spoken to a great deal of fellow sufferers. Every single one of them truly believes that it was a build up of severe stress or in some cases a severely stressful event, that preceded their Bell's Palsy.<br /><br />Most of these people, including myself, have taken a philosophical view of the entire event and had a really good look at our lives. I mean, if you cannot even count on your own smile, then one must search for some truths that you can indeed count upon. It is most certainly an experience that will change you entire life, and for the better, if you want it to.<br /><br />Although it can be said with total conviction that stress reduces our immune systems and that a positive and calm mental outlook can actually boost our immune system's health and responsiveness, it is always a reactive and medicinal solution that is prescribed. I found that this webpage explained this intelligently on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Fza2RhdGluZ2V4cGVydHMuY29tLzI5MDEvcG9sbC0yLw__" target="_blank">Williams Wekenborg</a> website.<br /><br />More importance should be placed on the preventative skills needed to live our lives with the awareness of stress and its early symptoms, rather than to try to correct the resultant illnesses that it will nearly always produce.<br /><br />It is a known fact that between 80 - 90% of attendees at doctors' surgeries are there with a condition or problem that has its foundations firmly rooted in a build up of stress.<br /><br />Is it therefore the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) or for that matter, any other virus, infection or malady, that has caused the resultant complaint, or is it the tightening grip of the tentacles of stress upon our lives and therefore our physical immunity, that has forced the condition?<br /><br />There apparently is no proven cure or protection from Bell's Palsy. Time, rest and relaxation are the only widely accepted cures.<br /><br />I suggest that the instructions &quot;To lead a life with a positive, calm and unworried mental outlook, focussed upon hope, derived from a truth that can be counted upon&quot; should be folded into a bottle and sold as the preventative medicine for all ailments, in chemists, churches, hospitals, schools and even the workplace vending machine.<br /><br />I hope that you will always have a special smile and that it will always be special, to all who have the pleasure of seeing it.

A thousand yards from the trailhead is the battle scene. Off the Dallas Highway, the Cheatham Hill Connector is at the west side. Continue to the north of the Dead Angle towards the parking area where you will see a set of cannons near the Texas monument. It shows the Confederates and Union casualties during the attack. The Confederate commander ordered a cease fire from his men to allow his opponents to get their wounded as they were burning to their death. I found that this blog demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jpa2VyZXZpZXdzaGFjay5jb20vMTE2Mi9sb25nLWhvbmRhLWNnMTI1LW1vdG9yY3ljbGUtYmFzZWQtbWlsZWFnZS8_" target="_blank">Roberto Vanderbilt</a> blog post.<br /><br />From the parking lot found at the end of Cheatham Hill Drive, find the trailhead by walking to the south end of the parking lot. Although the trail can be taken whichever way you prefer, start the hike by pacing throughout the trail counter-clockwise. Passing the fence, walk towards Mebane's Tennessee Battery at the right. It offers you a visual of the set of cannons that were used against advancing Yankees during the battle. Move past this and continue to pass through Confederate entrenchments on the left.<br /><br />Then turn right at the base and circle around the path as you turn around to view the monument up close and personal. To the left of this magnificent monument, you will find a small tunnel that the Union troops built. However, they were trapped by the Confederate fire from the entrenchments above the hill as they try to create a tunnel under the Rebel position to quash it.<br /><br />Now continue to climb back to Cheatham Hill Loop. Take the right trail as it leads forward left following the curve of the The Angle's trenches. This is the site where William Tecumseh Sherman lost his partner Union Army officer Dan McCook, who was one of the patriarchs of the &quot;Fighting McCooks&quot;. McCook was also known as one of the two Ohio brothers along with their 13 sons who fought during the Civil War.<br /><br />At this point, expect a moderate descent emerging out to a tom of an unknown Union soldier which was discovered by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1938. Reaching an intersection, turn left from it leading you back to Cheatham Hill Loop which abruptly joins Kolb's Farm Loop. Continue straight ahead taking the Cheatham Hill Loop turning left after leaving the intersection. The trail then leads to an ascent towards the top of the hill and ends at the parking area.

If you know only a little bit about consoles you probably heard of the Red Ring of Death error which affected as many as 30% of the first Xbox 360 models. Believe it or not Sony did not learn from Microsoft's mistake and the Yellow Light of Death is a PlayStation version of the Red Ring of Death. It also occurs due to the exact same reason as the Red Ring of Death.<br /><br />So what causes the RROD on Xbox 360 and YLOD on the PS3? The answer is overheating and poor design of cooling and chip attachment to the motherboard. These two flaws combined have catastrophic results and kill the console over time. Both consoles are extremely powerful but have too small casings with poor ventilation and release of excess of heat. After playing your PS3 for few hours what happens is the temperature rises a point where the solder joints attaching the CPU and GPU chips to the motherboard liquefy and then solidify again once you switch the console off.<br /><br />These heating cycles put stress on the solder joints and make them weaker and at a point, sooner or later one of the hundreds of solder joints breaks and the motherboard loses connection to the chip (either processor or graphical chip). At this point your PS3 will show the yellow light of death to notify you of the problem.<br /><br />Now that you know what causes the problem lets talk about your options to get your PS3 running again. I found that this blogger showed this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Fza2V4ZXJjaXNlLmNvbS8yNDk3L2hhcmRlbHktdGltZS1leGVyY2lzZS1sb29zZS1tdWZmaW4tdG9wLWhhdmVpbmcta2lkLXllYXIv" target="_blank">Clayton Stample</a> weblog.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 1:&lt;/b&gt; If your console is still under warranty call the Sony customer service line (800-345-7669) and tell them what happened. You will have to send them your PS3 for repair or they will send you a refurbished one. It's completely free but you will have to pay the shipping and insurance and wait for few weeks to get your PS3 back.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 2:&lt;/b&gt; If your PlayStation 3 is no longer under warranty you can still send it to Sony for repair. But they will charge your $150 + shipping and insurance and you will only get a 3 months extended warranty on the repaired or refurbished PS3. So if something goes wrong with it and the yellow light of death comes back after this period you can prepare another $150 and forget about gaming for weeks again. I do not recommend this option because it's a waste of money.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 3:&lt;/b&gt; Don't feel like giving Sony $150 to fix a problem THEY CAUSED? You don't have to! You can fix your PS3 at home yourself. No need to waste hundreds of dollars (it cost you enough to buy the PS3) or having to wait for weeks. If you think fixing a PS3 requires a tech savvy person or special tools you are wrong. People who never took anything apart fixed their PS3's without any problems.<br /><br />All you have to do is follow a step-by-step video tutorial with commentary which will guide you through the whole process screw by screw and you could be playing your PS3 TODAY!

It encourages muscle pumping as it helps to supply water and oxygen to the muscles. Nitric Oxide strengthens the immune system and helps in preventing diseases like cancer, heart attacks and diabetes that could prove fatal. It encourages collagen production that helps to slows down the aging process.

I would like to draw a comparison between these two artists so as to better understand their work.<br /><br />Leonardo is a figure of the Renaissance whereas Van Gogh is from the late 19th Century. However, these two great men have much to offer us today in ways that are very similar to each other. First and foremost both men are very linear in their approach to art.<br /><br />Leonardo always had his sketchbook with him so as to grab images quickly while he was about. These sketches form the basis for the undertaking of all of his great works. One only has to look at he Adoration of the Magi or his Cartoon of the Virgin and St. Anne to immediately grasp his understanding and use of line. Leonardo's grasp of line was for far more than a drafting skill to set-up a painting, rather his drawings are expression of his core feelings and thoughts about his subjects and he conveys about this in his writings. I found that this person described this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsZWN0cm9uaWNkcnVta2l0cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9nb29kLWRydW0tYmFzcy1tdXNpYy03NS8_" target="_blank">Azzie Blankenbaker</a> article.<br /><br />Van Gogh too uses his drawings in his work, however, unlike Leonardo, Van Gogh would paint directly on the canvas without the use of any drawings. This is not to diminish his drawings, rather, it is to demonstrate the mind of Van Gogh. If you look and any of his drawings you are aware all at once that everything in the drawing is the subject. Van Gogh is able to integrate together all that he sees and put them down on paper. Certain drawings of his are so outstanding that it is difficult to look at them and understand them. In the same manner Leonardo's drawings of wind and water are masterpieces that are difficult to understand but the message of the drawings call out to you.<br /><br />With regards to the paints of the two masters both of them and totally different approaches. Leonardo wanted to convey the scene or event that has been requested of him, whereas Vincent had no desire to convey any scene. Van Gogh wanted to express himself through his paintings and often that means that they are very abstract and not easily rendered as images of scenes or events. The key difference between Leonardo and Van Gogh is that the later's work pulsates and demonstrates vigor. Leonardo on the other hand used very subtle tones and strokes to render his art. Both men are very different in their approach to art but both of them offer us the same thing and that is the revelation of the inner consciousness at work within us and made manifest through their art.<br /><br />Stephen F.

As well as skills in art mediums of painting and drawing, Leonardo also went onto achieve success in a whole other set of disciplines in which he would also add his customary innovation. Although his art is the main focus of this article, much of it fits closely with other fields in which he was involved. For example, his sketches in some cases depicted some ingenious inventions, though only at a very low level that at the time seemed impossible dreams. The genius of Leonardo da Vinci is underlined by how many of these inventions later became full products centuries later. I found that this blogger showed this intelligently on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RydW1raXRzcmV2aWV3cy5jb20vcGxheS1iYXNzLWRydW1zLw__" target="_blank">Jerrod Lynott</a> weblog.<br /><br />Leonardo's best paintings include titles such as The Mona Lisa (La Gioconda), The Last Supper, St John the Baptist, Baptism of Christ, Adoration of the Magi, Leda, Portrait of Ginevra Benci and Virgin of the Rocks. Most artists of this era would concentrate on religious depictions as they would be placed directly into rich institutions such as churches and cathedrals which could afford to pay large commissions. With few others able to pay the same salaries, artists were always likely to be covering famous religious scenes with their skills in order to pay the bills. Leonardo da Vinci was respected enough to be able to find time to address his own artistic curiosities and so would only choose projects that specifically appealed to him. It was rare for an artist at this time to have such power within his career and unfortunately most would lead relatively frustrated lives, and this continues today with most creative people, not just painters.<br /><br />Reproductions of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings are best served as framed art prints which finish the original brilliance of the artist with a professional touch that looks great in most homes. Younger fans may instead go for posters or stretched canvases instead. The art market is now flooded with Da Vinci reproductions, with many offering alternative versions of the original paintings, such as cropped elements in greater detail or slightly different tonal and colour balances.<br /><br />Leonardo da Vinci was certainly the most influential of artists, with a great breadth of talent that is unsurpassed by any human, and only matched by Michelangelo. The Renaissance was led by these two figureheads, with others adding their own more narrow specialties on top to drive European art development onwards. Italian art peaked during this period and has never risen to the same levels since, in terms of influence on other countries and as such Leonardo da Vinci will always be amongst the most respected painters and sketchers with in the country.
