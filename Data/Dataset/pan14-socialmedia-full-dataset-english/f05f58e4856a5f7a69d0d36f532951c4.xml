Social media, television, and smart phones are deadly for anyone who needs to stay focused on a task. While watching last week’s episode of Mad Men is more exciting than working on a proposal that is due in two weeks, you’ll wish you had saved the show for later when that deadline finally comes around.
<br /><br />We are all guilty of procrastination, but that doesn’t mean we can’t learn from the time spent guzzling coffee in the wee hours of the morning and mumbling about how we should have started working weeks ago. Here are 5 ways to stop procrastinating.
<br /><br />1. Break apart a big project into small, manageable goals.
<br /> It’s hard to start working when the only thing on your to-do list is “Complete Budget Report.” Splitting big projects into small tasks helps you avoid feeling overwhelmed. It also motivates you to start because tackling mini assignments is much easier than trying to complete an entire report in one sitting! For instance, you may want to create sections for your budget report:
<br /><br />• Analyze current expenditures from Marketing department
<br /> • Create charts and other visual aids to illustrate the current allocation of funds
<br /> • Brainstorm ways to reduce spending or to spend more effectively
<br /> • Write a report to explain suggestions for reallocation of funds
<br /><br />As you can see, small sections take less time to complete and are easier to manage.
<br /><br />2. Give yourself challenging tasks.
<br /> When tasks are too simple and monotonous, you lost enthusiasm. You’ll put off tedious tasks until the end, and when you finally get around to them, you won’t demonstrate your best effort because you’ll feel as if they are not worth your time. To stay motivated, make sure that you set challenging goals!
<br /><br />3. Tell others about your goals.
<br /> If you mention your goals, people are bound to bring them up again. They act as reminders that will encourage you to accomplish your tasks! In addition, explaining your goals to your peers can inspire them to be ambitious.
<br /><br />4. Eliminate distractions:
<br /> Our worlds are so filled with distractions that a 5-minute break can easily turn into a 5-hour break. Take those distractions out of the equation and they won’t be a problem. Leave your phone in another room and deactivate Facebook. Hold all calls and leave your door closed, even if you usually have an open-door policy. If you’re working from home, give the kids a 1000-piece puzzle and a plate of cookies. Then make your way into your home office and get to work!
<br /><br />5. Switch up your environment:
<br /> Spending too much time in one place may actually decrease your productivity. If you’re tired of staring at your cubicle wall, take your stuff into a different room. If you work at home and find that the bedroom is tempting, drive to the local coffee shop and set up a work station there. Go somewhere that inspires you to keep working. Going outside can motivate you and relieve stress!
<br /><br />And now for your ideas. How do you stop yourself from procrastinating?

Learn How to Get Ahead in a New Work Env<br/><br/>Entering the workforce as a new staff member can be a daunting experience. However, developing certain habits early on in the job will help with an easy transition into the organization. Not only will you be able to face challenges with confidence, but you will have the skills necessary to become a highly valued and integral part of a team.
<br /><br />Here are some important characteristics to have in the workplace:
<br /><br /><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: One must develop a greater sense of self-awareness to better adapt to the culture and dynamic of the organization. Always adhere to company’s rules and policies in both its formal and informal aspects. One way to do this is by paying close attention to the interaction between the people in the office and to mimic appropriate behaviors.   Employers appreciate it when new staff members learn about the company’s infrastructure on their own. The integration process does not have to be a thorny one.  Being attentive and alert will not only help you feel more comfortable in the workplace, but it will also give you a better understanding of the company’s vision.
<br /><strong>Listening Skills</strong>: Communication is not just about speaking – it is also about listening.  Listening intently is beneficial for workplace success because it creates a mindset that absorbs information and knowledge. Hearing is often mistaken for listening, but really listening effectively takes practice. Research shows that people only retain about 20-50 percent of the content when in a conversation. This natural tendency is counter-productive and harmful when it leads to misunderstanding and conflict between people.
<br /><strong>Motivation</strong>: Try to learn as much about the company as possible by doing additional research. Being resourceful is the key to success anywhere. Spend some time to look over the company’s different databases, as this will offer invaluable background information on how the company functions and its purpose. This will come in handy when tasks are assigned, because new staff members will have a better understanding of the meaning of their work, a direction on how to approach tasks, and what results are expected. In addition, take the initiative to do more than what is expected, and ask for feedback on assignments given. Being motivated also means being consistent in providing the best service for both clients and employers.
<br /><strong>Positive attitude</strong>: Bringing a positive attitude to work is essential for success, because others are drawn to people who are optimistic and enthusiastic about what they do. Having a positive attitude translates into passion and drive. From a managerial perspective this will represent someone who creates value for the organization, and will be able to get along and work well with their colleagues. Besides, staying positive will generate affirmative responses, which in turn is favorable for a new staff member. The office will also benefit from a mood-lift and upbeat atmosphere.
<br /><br />What are your ideas for making transition to a new environment easier?  What do you think employees should do to feel more comfortable in a new workplace?

Entrepreneurship offers potential large earnings, as seen with plenty of financial success stories with innovators such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and more recently, Mark Zuckerberg. The career path also endows the entrepreneur with a state of independence, allowing him or her to be their own boss, and conduct business the way they see fit. But with all of these factors considered, what exactly is the driving force to becoming an entrepreneur? You’ll find that it is a combination of these perks.
<br /><br />A passion for innovation is the first common draw of entrepreneurship. Mark Zuckerberg, the poster boy for the entrepreneurial spirit in the modern internet age and his revolutionary invention, Facebook, the most popular social media website available comes to mind when we first think of entrepreneurs. The release of the film, “The Social Network”, a film retelling his story to fame has provided even more depth to modern day entrepreneurship. Zuckerberg’s ingenuity and creativeness are put on full display as the viewer witnesses the evolution of the site and its explosive popularity spawning from a dorm room in Harvard to an explosion around the globe. 
<br /><br />Aspiring entrepreneurs share the similar passion and zest for creativity that Zuckerberg showed. Many choose the entrepreneur route because they possess the desire to contribute to society with something new and exciting. Despite the information age that we live in, resistance to innovation and a stubborn grasp to tradition is still a common theme among businesses. Entrepreneurs want to challenge this approach with out-of-the-box thinking and revolutionary new ideas.
<br /><br />Financial success plays a role as well, albeit not quite as large a role as one might think. A large of part of successful entrepreneurs sticking in the minds of society is the net worth and eight-figure business deals that are tagged along to entrepreneurs’ names. Entrepreneurs enjoy the challenge of achieving financial success and stability through their own handiwork. But while major pioneers like Apple Computers, Facebook, Microsoft, and Disney are well documented for their financial success, the average entrepreneur is actually likely to earn less than those who didn’t choose the entrepreneur route. It can be expected that many strive to be an entrepreneur for similar dreams of big money success, but the drive behind entrepreneurship will have to dive deeper than just the number of zeroes on a paycheck.
<br /><br />The heart of the drive behind becoming an entrepreneur is based around independence. Entrepreneurship is unique in the sense that it deters away from many other common job paths that install a hierarchical system. Employees in this system begin at entry level positions and slowly work their way through the positional ladder of the company while their experience accumulates. Many who choose entrepreneurship aren’t interested in working their way through the traditional ladder, where they are expected to answer to an overseeing supervisor. Rather, entrepreneurs intend to remain independent and enjoy the prospect of being their own supervisor. An entrepreneur wants to wake up in the morning knowing that they make a living through their own vision. The drive for an entrepreneur lies in the challenge of bringing an idea forefront to succeed, or to build a business that they created. There are no employers handing them paychecks for tasks that benefit someone else’s company. The paycheck an entrepreneur earns benefits his or her own company, a reward that satisfies both the bank account and the hunger for success from within.
<br /><br />Looking at the drive behind entrepreneurship as a whole, both the prospect of money and grandeur play a part in choosing the entrepreneur route, but they are secondary thoughts compared to holding your own independence in the workplace. Deep down, entrepreneurs seek the unique option that differentiates itself from all the other jobs out there; the freedom to be one’s own employer.

<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/170420076_11650409_50287037.jpg" />
<br />What exactly is work ethic? Work ethic is being personally accountable for the responsibilities that one values most.  Work ethic is an intrinsic characteristic which means it comes from within. Work ethic may be shown in the work place or through personal matters and overall, we want to build a positive work ethic for ourselves in order to be successful. Having confidence in ourselves is one of the ways we can dramatically increase our work ethic and success within our lives.  
<br />The question is: How does self-confidence build a person to gain positive work ethic? Here are 4 ways:
<br />1.	Confidence increases self motivation
<br />Having a great sense of confidence,a worker will feel an increase in motivation to achieve their own personal goals.Those who have confidence within themselves are more likely to take the initiative with their work.  Confident people are more likely to stay focused and reach their end goals.
<br />2.	Confidence promotes better performance
<br />Confidence affects work performance. Having confidence with oneself enables a worker to do a better job with their tasks and priorities. They tend to feel comfortable with it. Self-confidence also lets the worker take on tasks that are more challenging because confidence affects performance. It is noticeable when that worker has  high self-confidence with their work.  
<br />3.	Confidence builds character
<br />Those who have high self confidence always believe in themselves. They feel defeated, even through all the difficulties they may face. They also feel more competent and have less feelings of doubt. People with low sense of confidence tend to do the opposite. 
<br />4.	Confidence creates great social relationships
<br />People with self-confidence have better relationships with their peers because they feel more comfortable with their surroundings. This allows confident workers to become more charming and give better impressions toward others. Confidence in social situations, especially in work environments, lets them work with others better.
<br />Now that we know why self-confidence creates positive work ethic, let us build this confidence!

<br /><strong>Avoid paragraph blocks.
<br /></strong>
<br />Having long paragraphs in slides of your presentation can cause confusion and laziness from your listeners. Not only can it overwhelm your audience, it can bore them as well!
<br /><br />Utilize bullet points and concise statements. These statements can be broad headings such as, “How to Network”. Your listeners can simply copy and paste paragraphs of your Powerpoint and learn nothing, but, if you utilize bullet points, they tend to be more attentive and alert throughout your presentation. Simplicity is key in a clear, effective Powerpoint.
<br /><br /><strong>Get Visual!</strong>
<br /><br />Be sure to recognize who your audience will be and add in visuals that appeal to them. For example, high school students may be more attentive if the Powerpoint has interesting photos and videos. On the other hand, business Powerpoints are more effective if there are charts, graphs, and images that clearly illustrate your statements.
<br /><br />Part of creating a visually appealing Powerpoint requires organization. Always organize your points, headings, fonts, colors, and slide themes. When small organizational mistakes are made, it can distract your audience.
<br /><br /><strong>Know your audience.
<br /></strong>
<br />What does my audience want to see in my presentation (Numbers? Data points? Photographs<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />?  How in depth should my presentation actually be? What will my listeners get out of my Powerpoint presentation? How can I most effectively communicate the information on my Powerpoint? Having the answers to these questions will help you execute your presentation with confidence. Be sure to know your audience and where they are coming from. In some cases, you may have to research different customs or provide extra visual aids such as brochures to satisfy your audience.

<br /><br />If your job is to party plan, you often have a creative mind. You see any venue as a blank canvas that you can shape into something incredible. It does not matter if the party is in a garden, a ballroom, or a warehouse, you have a vision that transforms the room into your clients dream. But what if you do not have the most creative mind? How do you take an aesthetically plain space and make it visually incredible? Here are some suggestions and ideas on how you can save money and how you could decorate to make a dream event.
<br /><br />Aesthetically Plain Rooms are Cheaper
<br /><br />These rooms for rent are very bland and may not be in the most luxurious location but it will save you a couple hundred bucks. Not only will you save money, but these are the best rooms to let your imagination soar. View an open, plain space as a room that you can do anything in. This means decorations any way you want, any color palette, and more options for everything. Here are some ways to dress up a plain room on a budget.
<br /><br />1. Ceiling Decorations: Think of a circus tent. A red and white tent carefully draped from the pieces with dangling Christmas lights, softly lighting your party from above. Can't imagine it? Just center pole that delicately falls to the edges of the circus ring. Now imagine it in long chiffon look at how beautiful and simple it is when you buy these pieces from a craft store.
<br /><br />2. Use a Theme: We all know how cliché theme parties are, but consider using the theme as a guideline rather than the whole party. For example, a 20's themed party can be infused into modern day by the color palette, decorations, or type of food. Keep it from time traveling back to the 20's by only picking one area to mix in. Disney themes are also popular for weddings or parties. Instead of buying a Snow White dress, infuse special props or moments form the movies to make it noticeable but won't take over the whole design. Here is a table piece from a Disney movie. Can you guess which one?
<br /><br />3. Table pieces: Sometimes all you need to tie a whole room together is an outstanding centerpiece. Most opt for a large assortment of fresh flowers, but this can prove to be very pricy. There are so many other options to create an eye catching piece that you could do yourself. Some examples include, cheap vintage lamps that are spray painted to match your color palette or different sized candles grouped together to create a flickering glow. My favorite idea is to take a cylinder, glass vase and throw a beautiful, fake flower inside. Then fill it up with water and place candles around it. Want to see?
<br /><br />All of these tips come at a low cost and are things that you can do yourself. Follow these guidelines and your next party will be a dream event.

In this competitive world, many say that “It is who you know and who knows you” that will increase one’s success. Networking with others is a crucial part increasing the likelihood of success because it gives the individual more chances to gain extended help from others. Although the pressures of creating a strong network base might seem tough, building an effective network is actually simpler than it sounds. Just follow these three easy steps and next think you know, you’ll have your network. 
<br /><br />1.	Remember  Names
<br />When we meet new people the first thing we do is we introduce ourselves with one another. We then tell each other our names and soon after we strike a conversation. However, the problem is that once we have introduced ourselves we easily get distracted from remembering the names of those whom we met. To avoid forgetfulness, try matching their names with something significant you discovered about them or ask for the spelling of their name to increase the likelihood of remembering. If their name was forgotten due distractions, try asking for a business card or contact information towards the end of your conversation or meeting. It is very important to remember names because it shows that we pay attention to them. It also lets new contacts know that they matter us. 
<br /><br />2.	Create a Relationship with a Lasting Impression
<br /><br />Knowing the person is key for building strong relationships. What we are trying to do is getting to know them in a personal level.  An easy way of doing this is by initiating a conversation and asking questions about them such as interests, hobbies, or what they do for living. As the conversation is going try to to relate with them or develop what is being talked about further.  This step has to come naturally kind of like making friends, so to improve on this skill practice might be needed. In this step, our goal is to give those who we just met a lasting impression for them to remember us.  Networking should not be about how many people we have in our phonebooks, but instead the amount of people who we can contact for assistance in time of need.
<br /><br />3.	Keep in touch
<br />Keeping in touch is needed in order to maintain the relationships. Normally, we find ourselves occupied with our day-to-day activities, which makes it difficult to stay connected with our friends and networks. Even though we live very busy lifestyles, the advanced technology we have today has made keeping in touch much more convenient.  There are many ways we can communicate with our contacts in our network. We can chat with them online, send emails, send an SMS, call them through their mobile devices, etc. With this wealth of communication options there should not be any excuse for us to not be able to keep the relationship going. This communication is imperative; because we must show our friends and networks that we have not forgotten about them.

<br /><br />Many organizations don’t have a dedicated point-person for event marketing management. Yet, an event can make or break a campaign. Here are some handy event planning tips to help you from your initial stages of planning to the big day.
<br /><br /><strong>Bring out the Whiteboard</strong>
<br />No matter what the type of event you’re planning, you need a strategy. What is the goal of your event? Are you introducing a new product or service to customers? Whether your end goal is to get in front of key influencers or present before a group of executives, you’ll want to map out a strategy. Look at your target audience, identify the message that will resonate with them, and figure out how you are going to measure results. Remember, you’ll have no clue whether your event was a bust or boom unless you have the right metrics.
<br /><br /><strong>Bring Up Budget</strong>
<br />Once you have outlined your goals, you need to consider how much it will cost to accomplish them. Think back to events you’ve attended and imagine all the little things that were involved. Will you need name tags? Are you planning to serve food? Will you be giving your guests a parting gift for them to remember your presentation? What do you absolutely need and what can you live without? Make up a checklist and start developing an overall price tag.
<br /><br /><strong>A Time and Place for Every Event</strong>
<br />Are you hosting executives or managers? Is it a presentation or a mixer? Is this event part of your demand strategy or about brand awareness?
<br /><br />The answer to these questions should determine when and where your event is held. If you’re targeting busy executives, for instance, you might want to plan a fancy breakfast in a professional conference room. A networking event is best served in the evening with cocktails. A presentation feels forced in a bar. Better to hold that kind of an event in a conference room.
<br /><br />Be aware of how surroundings influence attention spans and the type of message that is expected to be heard.
<br /><br /><strong>Iteration of an Invite</strong>
<br />The invitation to your event is one of the most important aspects of the entire planning process. You don’t want to send out the first invitation too early or too late. hree weeks out is a good rule to live by. But if you want to get on executives’ calendars, you might want to send it out even earlier. A more detailed, elaborate invitation for a dinner event is appropriate, but you may want to be simpler and straight to the point. Include directions that show access to public transportation. Make it easy for your attendees!
<br /><br />You’ll also want to follow up. Those who have RSVP’d should receive reminders that differ in timing and message than those who haven’t.
<br /><br /><strong>Walk a Mile</strong>
<br />Visit the venue the day before your event. Envision how you want attendees to experience the event. What signs need to be in place to avoid confusion? Where should you station staff? Basically, you want to understand what your guests will see from the time they walk into the venue to the registration table to the actual event. The way your guests feel matters, and the only way to anticipate this is to walk a mile in your guests’ shoes.
<br /><br />What are your tips for throwing an event? Have you learned any lessons along the way?

<br /><br />Attitude is one of the most important qualities to look for in employees because they represent your company when interacting with clients, vendors, and associates.  A person with positive energy and enthusiasm is best for handling stressful situations and finding solutions.  You don’t want someone with a negative attitude and a tendency to make excuses for why things can’t get done – this kind of energy makes a situation worse and is definitely not what you want in your company.  Your business would be better served by people who embrace challenges and are dedicated to solving problems.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;Intelligence:
<br /><br />Make sure your candidates are qualified for the position.  Identify the skills you need in order to run your business and look for those skills during interviews.  If you’re hiring recent graduates, make sure their grade point averages are decent and that they have taken courses related to what you do as a company.  Nowadays, many companies state that a Bachelor’s degree is the minimum requirement, and they actually prefer more education.  While you don’t have to shoot for MBA students, do make sure that you are hiring qualified individuals and not just settling for anyone.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;Communication:
<br /><br />Your employees should know how to articulate themselves clearly and professionally.  Communication skills are important even if your employees won’t always interact with clients.  If your business is to succeed, internal communication is extremely important.  Your employees should be able to tell you when they don’t understand something, especially when you are communicating your goals for the company. This is would be the part when during your interview with them; you should ask questions about how they would handle a situation with a client so you can pay special attention to the way they would speak to a client.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;Teamwork:
<br /><br />In today’s workplace most jobs are being done in a team environment. Being able to work appropriately and efficiently with others is very important to meet the satisfaction of the business and its clients. A good employee would need to understand the different personalities they would be dealing with in a group dynamic such as the jokester, leader, and cheerleader. Having creative differences cannot be avoided but how well a person deals with these situations determines the strength in their skills as a team player.
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;Technology:
<br /><br />It’s nearly impossible to enter a career in todays’ fast pace world without any knowledge of software programs such as Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These are some basic necessities but each profession has their own such as QuickBooks for accounting and administrative jobs. Some other programs used in office environments is 37Signals, a web application that helps small businesses stay organized with tasks and communicate with each other when not physically near one another. Learning the newest programs will make an employee stand out ahead of their
<br />opponents.

If you hate going through this, make sure you aren’t subjecting your audience to the same ordeal!  Whether you are preparing for that presentation that you have to give to your boss on Friday or getting ready to be a guest speaker at a conference, be sure that you aren’t making these presentation mistakes!
<br /><br />1. Reading your PowerPoint slides verbatim.
<br />This is bad whether you’re presenting to a class of college students or an auditorium filled with people. Your audience members don’t want to listen to you go through your bullet points word for word, especially since they can read for themselves. Instead, e-mail a copy of the PowerPoint to your guests and use your time to elaborate on points with stories and examples that you may not have had room to include on your PowerPoint slides.
<br /><br />2. Having all the colors of the rainbow in your PowerPoint theme. Or no colors at all.
<br /><br />While we’re on the topic of PowerPoint slides, it may be good to mention that the way your slideshow looks is just as important as what it says. Heck, it might even be more important since aesthetics can determine whether people actually pay attention to your PowerPoint. When creating your slideshow, select a simple template and settle for two to three main colors. You can always use different shades of a color to shake things up a bit. You don’t want a black and white PowerPoint, but you also want to stay away from gaudy color schemes.
<br /><br />One more thing – avoid overdoing it with the animations! Haven’t learned how to do them? Good. You don’t really need them. 
<br /><br />3. Ignoring the audience.
<br />A surefire way to get your audience to forget about you is to concentrate on your presentation without ever trying to engage people. It is important to interact with your guests! Tell stories and ask questions of your audience members to encourage them to pay attention and relate to you. You aren’t just sharing information; you’re also trying to create an emotional reaction to help people remember you.
<br /><br />4. Disregarding your time limit.
<br />If you’ve been given a half hour to present, stick to it. Respect your fellow speakers and your audience members by starting on time and finishing up when you are supposed to. You shouldn’t have any problems with time if you’ve practiced. Ideally, you have a clear idea of how long it will take you to cover your most important points because you have spent some time rehearsing and cutting out less important information that you don’t have time to discuss.
<br /><br />5. Getting up on stage and just winging it.
<br />Nothing is more disrespectful than giving a presentation that is unrehearsed. If you don’t practice, you can’t deliver ideas coherently and effectively. The audience will see that you have not bothered to prepare yourself and view your presentation as a waste of time.
<br /><br />As a note, preparing yourself isn’t about memorizing the words on your slides. Practicing for a presentation means knowing your content so well that you can pretty much do without the PowerPoint. When you genuinely know your material, you can have a conversation with your audience members rather than give a boring lecture that no one will remember. 
<br /><br />What presentation nightmares have you experienced? Do you have any tips on what to avoid doing when speaking in front of an audience?

Below are seven simple tips that can help you improve your public speaking skills and enable you to form a connection with the audience.
<br /><br />1. Organize and plan your presentation on paper
<br />To ensure that your target audience will understand your presentation, plan it out on paper. Brainstorming and sketching out your presentation on paper will help you determine the exact messages and methods that will be used for each part of your speech. This method of outlining your presentation will help you establish what key points to use and how your speech will be organized, making it easier for your listeners to follow your presentation. 
<br /><br />2. Create short, friendly headlines
<br />Can you describe your concept, product or service in less than 140 characters? Offering headlines or a short description for every concept, product, or services helps your audience members understand and remember you.
<br /><br />3.  Keep it short
<br />It’s best to organize your presentation into three, easily-remembered categories. The human brain can only process and remember three to four chunks of information at any given time. Overloading your guests with information will prevent them from recalling the value of your presentation.   
<br /><br />4. Introduce an antagonist
<br />Introducing a villain in your presentation with you as the protagonist is a great way to help customers to connect better to your concepts, product, or services. Every classical tale has a hero and villain. One example of this method is to identify a problem that your customers have and then emphasize how your product or service can eliminate the problem. You may even want to personify the problem to make it clearer in your guests’ minds. Think Mr. Mucus from the Mucinex commercials! 
<br /><br />5. Have a “wow” factor 
<br />People tend to easily forget words, phrases, and actions, but they remember emotions. If you create a moment of surprise, allure, wonder, or disbelief, your guests will remain engaged. These staged “wow” factors make your presentation more impressionable. 
<br /><br />6. Keep visuals simple
<br />All presentation slides and tools should be used to complement the presentation and not become the presentation itself. For instance, never read directly off your PowerPoint slides.  Don’t pay more attention to your posters than you do your audience.  Your visuals should not be overloaded with text and should instead have graphics that enable your guests to understand your information.  
<br /><br />7. Remember this: repetition, repetition, repetition
<br />Repetitions help the human brain process and remember keywords, phrases and concepts unconsciously and consciously. Exposing your audience to particular concepts or phrases frequently will help people remember important concepts and information from your speech or presentation. 
<br /><br />Public speaking is difficult and becoming a strong public speaker is a skill developed through life long experiences and practice. What advice do you have to offer people who are nervous for big presentations?

When you have a conversation in person you are able to rely on body language and facial expressions to better convey your feelings. Non-verbal cues account for 97% of communication while words only account for three percent. Talking to a client over the phone limits communication to only your voice and emailing takes away your voice and body language. Any form of miscommunication can run you the risk of losing your client! These tips may help you demonstrate to your clients that you are polite and genuinely engaged in the conversation.
<br /><br />1. Use a reliable phone. Cell phones will often lose signal or drop calls. Bad sound quality and weak signal can cause the conversation to falter. How can you communicate effectively when you miss half the conversation? This is why it is best to use a landline that you can depend on.
<br /><br />2. Stay in a quiet space. When office phones are ringing and coworkers are talking, it can be very distracting to yourself and your prospective client. Try to remain in a quite space where distractions are less present and you can focus all your attention on the client.
<br /><br />3. Avoid coughing or sneezing. If you are on the phone and you feel a cough or sneeze coming on, try to pull the phone away from your face so that your client cannot hear it. If you and your client are in person, it is polite to turn away or excuse yourself when you feel one coming on. Try to avoid using your hands. Instead, grab a handkerchief or tissue. Remember to wash your hands after you cough or sneeze!
<br /><br />4. Don’t let your throat get dry. Keeping a glass of water nearby will help you can stay hydrated. Avoid eating ice when you are on the phone. The crunching can be loud and distracting.
<br /><br />5. Never talk with your mouth full. Imagine all the embarrassing things that could happen if you opened your mouth to speak with food still in it!
<br /><br />6. Use a happy tone of voice. It is difficult to express emotion over the phone because clients cannot see your body language. Speaking softly and monotonously, clients will sense that you are bored or uninterested. However, by maintaining a decent volume and a cheery tone, others will be able to sense your emotion. Remember to smile! Even though you are on the phone, a smile can be conveyed through your voice.
<br /><br />7. Be a good listener. It is important to understand who your clients are and what their business is about. Also, let them completely finish what they are saying before you respond. Try not to let your mind wander from the call. You want to be able to provide them with any information they may need or answer any inquiries they may have. Sometimes it is more important for you to listen to what your clients are saying rather than just giving them generic information.
<br /><br />8. Understand your client’s culture. Every country and every culture has their own set of acceptable business norms; some actions that are acceptable in your culture may offend people in other cultures. For example, in the United States, people are direct when speaking to each other and try to get straight to the point. However, if you are working with someone in a country such as China or Japan, the people prefer to build a relationship before getting straight to business. It is important to research your client’s culture that way you can avoid any miscommunication.
<br /><br />9. Be professional when e-mailing. Keep e-mails brief, concise and clear; try to avoid adding in your own humor. Also, you do not get emotional when writing. Using ALL CAPS can be interpreted as shouting and that is not how you effectively communicate with clients.
<br /><br />10. Ask questions. You want to be completely informed about your clients’ needs and in order to do that, you need to ask questions.
<br /><br />11. End the call by thanking the client. A thank you will always be accepted with gratitude. It is important to show your clients that you appreciate their taking time out of their schedules to meet with you.
<br /><br />These are just a few tips to use to communicate more effectively but there are many more. What techniques do you use when trying to make a good first impression?

Search Engine Optimization has become one of the most important tools if you’re trying to get your business off the ground and remain relevant over the web. What is the most important thing when it comes to having a website? Getting people to visit it! With millions of websites flooding the web, and people relying purely on search results to provide them with information, services, and products, you want to make sure your website is seen before any other company. With these easy steps, you can do just that!
<br /><br />1. Use WordPress
<br /><br />First and foremost, if you haven’t transferred over to WordPress’s blogging platform, it’s time to consider making the switch. What makes WordPress so great?  It’s very user friendly, and it does a lot of the work for you. Who doesn’t love both of those attributes? Wait, it gets better! Google and other search engines love WordPress. WordPress provides plugins, widgets, and other customization tools that help make it easier for companies to establish a high ranking presence.
<br /><br />2. Social Media Networking
<br /><br />We have entered a new age of business. Information is being spread across Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and various other social networking sites. The more you’re connecting with people, the more aware people are going to be about your business. Social media networks enable you to communicate with your clients on a more person level.  If you haven’t already started, get out there and build connections!
<br /><br />3. Keyword Research
<br /><br />Keyword research is the most critical way to get your company to rank. You want to focus on key words that say what your company is about and what it has to offer. Be concise and straight to the point.  Now it’s time to implement the keywords into the title and body of your content. The objective here is to allow people using search engines the ability to find your website by using these key words.
<br /><br />4. Great Content
<br /><br />People always want to be intrigued. If the content you’re providing isn’t worth reading, the likelihood of people returning or remaining on your site is highly unlikely. Just like keywords, you want the content of your website to reflect the services or products you are providing. Just remember, keep the content on your website relevant, informative, and interesting!
<br /><br />5. Backlinking
<br /><br />This is the process of getting your website link on other relevant websites.  When another website links an article you wrote, a page on your website, or any other content you create, search engines see it as a sort of testimonial to your relevance. The more authoritative websites link your content, the more valuable your website becomes.  How do you get backlinks?  Create helpful content and contribute relevant information.  Give your educated opinions on related industry articles and participate in related forums. Just remember to make your contributions sincere and relevant! The last thing you want is to be mistaken for spam.
<br /><br />What steps do you take to boost your company’s website ranking in search results?  Have you had success with your methodologies so far?

Planning the perfect time for the bride can be an extremely stressful situation. However; with the right steps in the planning process, it can be made easy.
<br /><br /><strong>Know the Bride</strong>
<br />First, it is important to decide whether you want to have a theme for the party. A theme not only makes the bridal shower memorable, it also makes the event easier to plan!  When you’re brainstorming ideas, think about what the bride-to-be likes.  What activities does she enjoy?  Does she have a particular fondness for a certain place in the world?  What are her favorite foods and drinks?  For instance, if the bride-to-be loves traveling to Spain, you could style the party accordingly.  You can have Spanish cuisine and related activities such as salsa dancing. Knowing whether the bride is outgoing or introverted is also important because an outgoing person might want to have a larger, more extravagant party, whereas an introverted individual might prefer to have more intimate gatherings.
<br /><br /><strong>Work Together</strong>
<br />Planning an entire bridal shower alone is not only a stressful task, but can also be counterproductive. For better ideas and more efficient planning, round up the bride’s family and friends.  Typically, the bridesmaids are tasked with planning the shower, so make sure each girl has a job to do.  For example, one person could be in charge of the invitation and RSVP’s, while another could be in charge of the activities and games for the event.
<br /><br /><strong>The Guest List</strong>
<br />Traditional bridal showers are usually exclusive – only the bride’s female friends and family members are present.  In recent years, wedding showers have become popular as well.  Wedding showers allow both male and female friends to be present, which may work out better for brides who want to be able to spend time with all of their close friends.  Think about what your bride-to-be wants.  Will she prefer a traditional bridal shower, or will she enjoy having a co-ed gathering?  Of course, if the bride is a part of the planning process, deciding what kind of shower to throw is easier.  If you’re trying to put on a surprise party, you’ll just have to rely on what you know about the bride.
<br /><br /><strong>Entertainment for Her</strong>
<br />Think of games that you can play throughout the shower to ensure that your guests are enjoying themselves. Come up with fun games and work in some other ways to entertain the crowd, such as putting on a slideshow of the bride and groom during the event.
<br /><br /><strong>Don’t Get Too Carried Away</strong>
<br />Although you want to plan the perfect bridal shower and make sure your guests stay entertained, you do not want to bombard them. Having time set aside for a couple of games and gift opening is acceptable, but you want to make sure you leave some time for mingling and relaxing. Give yourself time to enjoy the perfect bridal shower you planned!

You finally find the perfect venue, and you creatively decorate the space that was once an empty canvas. When the time comes for people to arrive, no one shows up. Not only is your heart broken from the hours you’ve spent planning and decorating, your wallet is broken as well.
<br /><br />Who loves to plan an event, invite hundreds of people and only have a few people show up? Nobody! Nobody wants to spend time, money, and effort for nothing. There’s nothing worse than spending precious hours in planning an event only to find that other people don’t care or never heard about it to begin with.
<br /><br />So how can you get more people to show up? What can you do to change your event promotion tactics? Here are a few tips:
<br /><br />1. Create unique invitations
<br /><br />Make your invitations stand out! An invitation that immediately grabs your attention can really sell your event. Evoke excitement and inspire your guests to look forward to your event. Aside from the traditional physical invitations, send an e-vite. There is no doubt that e-vites are starting to get more popular in this paperless, technologically-advanced society.
<br /><br />2. Create a place for registration and keep it as simple as possible
<br /><br />One way to better understand the dynamic of your event is to create a destination where attendees can sign up and receive critical information. It’s also important to keep registration as simple as possible. Don’t force your guests to fill out entire surveys – keep in mind that guests don’t usually like to share much more information than their names. Keep it short and sweet and ask for basic contact information.
<br /><br />3. Don’t forget the reminders
<br /><br />People tend to forget dates and times easily. Send out reminder e-mails and reminder invitations to recipients and attendees. At the same time, you can keep guests interested and more importantly, continue to give them more opportunities to register before the deadline.
<br /><br />Most importantly, be creative. Follow these tips, but don’t be afraid to come up with new and innovated ideas to see a great turnout for your next event!

These rooms are blank canvases that can be transformed into any exciting and vibrant setting you can imagine.
<br /><br />1. <strong>Designate space for different activities.</strong> Depending on the type of event you are planning, space can be designated for different activities such as dining, socializing, or dancing.
<br />The following basic guidelines and tips can help transform your next event:
<br /><br />Break away from the traditional method of organizing tables and create fun arrangements for dinner receptions or meetings. Using a diagonal layout for chairs and tables makes optimal use of space and encourages engaging interactions between the speaker and guests.
<br /><br />If you are planning a social event, create spaces that encourage mingling with the use of living room-type furniture. Contact local furniture rental companies to check out the types of sofas, coffee tables, chairs, and rugs they have to offer. Areas with these pieces create a welcoming and comfortable place for guests to relax and enjoy each others’ company.
<br /><br />Guests need a lot of space when dancing; the benefit of holding your event in a large venue is being able to have an area that is designated for dancing. Tables are great for defining the dance floor; create a floor plan that arranges the tables to surround the area where you want the dance floor to be located. Placing the dance floor near the DJ will enable him to interact with guests.
<br /><br />2. <strong>Use strategic lighting to change the mood.</strong> Lighting can help create the mood or atmosphere you desire for your event. Depending on the theme of the event, different colored lights can be used to enhance the room and decorations.
<br /><br />Up lights come in a variety of colors and can be used to soften walls or complement décor. 
<br /><br />Up lights can be easily rented through a local audio/visual or lighting company.
<br /><br />Gobos are lights that project shapes, logos and words. Use them on a wall to display your company’s logo or on the dance floor to create moving shapes. Rent gobos from lighting companies to create a custom and unique look for your event.
<br /><br />Candles can transform a large venue into an intimate space. Candles can create visually attractive and romantic areas when placed on tables and near seating areas.
<br /><br />3. <strong>Create height in open spaces.</strong> Make use of large venuesusing center pieces, AV equipment and decorations.
<br /><br />Tall centerpieces can enhance the height of a room by making use of the open space. Centerpieces should be tall enough that guests are able to see under them and place on tables that are large enough so that the centerpiece does not look out of place.
<br /><br />Utilize large walls for projections in meetings and conferences. This will help fill the room and draw attention away from empty spaces.
<br /><br />Do you have any ideas for transforming a blank room into an exquisite event space? Let us know your thoughts!

Due to the economy not being what it used to be and the price of clothing still on the rise, consumers are looking for a cheaper alternative to shopping for clothing and accessories.  Well, shoppers can have a little something to rejoice about!
<br /><br />When companies have an excess inventory or a collection of products that have slight appearance defects, they have to findways to unload the merchandise without losing money.  What better way to get rid of their excess inventory than to have a sample sale?
<br /><br />Sample sales are a win-win for the company and consumers. They give consumers an opportunity to buy the products they’ve always wanted at the fraction of the cost. Sample sales can consist mostly of clothing items, but can also include accessories, furniture, eyewear, shoes, and house wares. Sample sales have become increasingly popular over the years, not only because of the incredible savings for consumers, but also because of things like giveaways, concerts, and food trucks that make the event entertaining.
<br /><br />American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, Roxy, and Volcom are among some of the companies who hold sample sales.  The list, however, doesn’t end with giant clothing companies.  Boutiques and small establishments can also have sample sales, and you’re usually able to find some great stuff at a fraction of the price in department stores.
<br /><br />Sample sales are usually held in company warehouses and other large industrial spaces.  The Business Expo Center has two Expo Halls that are similar in nature to these venues, which is why the facility is well-suited to hold sample sales. Companies can use the venue’s large spaces for the actual sample sale and use multiple other rooms to interact with their consumers.  The Business Expo Center has rooms ranging from 2,000 to 12,000 square feet, which means it has plenty of space available to use for clothing sample sales and other entertainment possibilities!
