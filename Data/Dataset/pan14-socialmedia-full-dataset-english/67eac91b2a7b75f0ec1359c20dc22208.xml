<br /><br />'k, so upon reflection, i decided that &quot;john&quot; was a scammer, and i reported the profile.  i don't know what the process is here for reported pages... but i guess either way i've let him know that i don't have any money, so i won't be sending any to him.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />   heh.
<br /><br />this weekend i've decided to visit some friends out of town. yay!  i've been itching for a roadtrip ever since i got home from alaska in may.  of course, this week has been so busy at work w/ hours of OT and new projects &amp; everything, i'm not really looking forward to the drive.  i'm sure that will  change as soon as i get going.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  i love to drive w/ the music going &amp; the shades on!

<br /><br />came back today &amp; beat the storm home.  i love storms!  the lightning &amp; thunder make me happy - as long as no power lines go down!  heh.  i remember when i was little, and it would be SO HOT outside, and the power would go off.  no fans, no AC, no tv to distract from the complete lack of air movement.  couldn't read, cuz there were no lights.  couldn't sleep, cuz it was too hot.  but, even then, the thunder &amp; lightning were cool!  
<br /><br />well, tomorrow's a busy day - meetings &amp; lots of work to get done.  so i guess i should go to sleep so i'll get up on time, huh?  have a good night!

		<document id="a178edac893a450779c9a8f4b74ed8ca" url=""><![CDATA[crazy times - a novel!<br/><br/>thank God it's friday!  i've had a really stressful last two weeks.  work has been insane, a little bit!  heh.  i love my job.  i love what i do, the ppl, my team is really neat &amp; my boss is AWESOME.  God really is looking out for me, and i appreciate it a lot.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />i don't normally let things stress me out.  i got my daddy's personality for the most part, and i'm thankful for that.  but apparently even i can only handle so much.  
<br /><br />home stress: one of my best friends from college was having a hard time at home (a town a few hours away).  she needed some help &amp; a place to stay.  i'd just bought my home &amp; had set up a guest room.  i moved in in february.  her problems came up at the end of march, and she moved in april 1st.  she struggles w/ depression, so the plan was for her to move here &amp; take a couple weeks off, then look for a job &amp; a doctor, get on some meds &amp; put her life together.  i naively thought that while she was here she would help out w/ some things - ya know, pick up after herself &amp; maybe help w/ the cleaning &amp; things since i was working all day &amp; she was just ... here.  nope!  
<br /><br />then, to compound her depression, in june her youngest sister died in a car accident.  she was only 16.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  very very sad!  however, i had  just lost my father, my best friend, so i know the pain &amp; the agony of it.  but i still had to go back to work, and life goes on.  i helped her get a job, but she wasn't ready yet &amp; ended up going in for one day &amp; then calling off the next day &amp; being let go.  that was my  &quot;last straw&quot;  &amp; i told her she needed to get  going w/ a doctor &amp; medication, assistance of some kind, because i just couldn't afford to support her anymore. 
<br /><br />she chose to call her parents &amp; go live with them.  
<br /><br />except her dad, who has always been a jerk &amp; treated her HORRIBLY when she went to the hospital to visit her younger sister, says no.  he will not help her.  he will not let her  mom help her.  he made her cry, a lot.   she became much nicer to me.  and then, that same night, i found out one of my favorite uncles had shot himself &amp; was dead.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  
<br /><br />but i did not break.  i felt like i was going to, but i didn't.  my friend was very supportive &amp; helpful, and she started to get on track, making appointments w/ a doctor &amp; DHS for food assistance.  things on that end got better, tho she still has some weird aversion to vacuuming or cleaning up after herself in the kitchen...but i'm working on that part!
<br /><br />work stress:  our team has been kind of short staffed the past few months.  we've had a lot of movement - transfers &amp; new ppl &amp; whatnot.  my work load has gotten considerably heavier the past month or two, and i've had to put in some extra hours.  again, i enjoy what i do.  but no matter how much you enjoy something, when you feel like you've never left the office, it's not a good thing. heh.  so, last friday i started having heart flutters, but i figured it was just normal aches &amp; pains.  when the flutters kept happening, along w/ some shoulder &amp; arm pain on my left side, i started to panic.  
<br /><br />i left work early on wednesday &amp; went to the dr. i didn't enjoy the dr. that i randomly picked.  she just ... her nurse was gruff &amp; brusque &amp; then she seemed to have stuff set in her head &amp; i didn't feel like she was listening to me.  plus, she recommended another doctor who i found out has had his license suspended for sexually harassing his female patients!!!  yeesh.  but she did prescribe me some meds for high BP, which i do have, and the meds seem to be working.  i went back today for a BP check up &amp; it was significantly lower, tho still high.  still, i think i'll be finding another dr. if my 2nd visit w/ her next month doesn't make me feel more comfortable.  ya know?  
<br /><br />life stress in general:  well, because of the roommate sitch, i'm having financial stress.  the OT on the next checks will help.  LOL  also, as i think i mentioned before, october is a hard month.  my dad passed away last halloween, and i can't believe it's been a year.  it feels like last month, or ten years ago. it feels like he'll come back from a fishing trip any minute now, and i can send him an email &amp; ask him to go to a movie w/ me!  but i can't.  
<br /><br />PTL for my mom - she &amp; i have had our rough times, but we've gotten closer this past year, and that is a nice thing.  she has helped me out mentally &amp; financially a LOT.   
<br /><br />so!  that's what's been going on w/ me, lately, and what makes for crazy times.  i know most of you already know all of this, so sorry for the recap.  but it felt good to write it all out!

<br /><br />oh, this whole hannah montanna concert stuff.  good grief!  i'm sure that miley cyrus does not want her tickets being sold for $3000.  she knows she has young fans &amp; they are her bread &amp; butter so to speak.  i would warrant a guess that most performers don't want outrageous ticket prices.  so who's to blame?  according to ticketmaster, they have  things in place to curb mass buying of tickets by scalpers.  but the other day dwyer &amp; michaels (or it may have been dave &amp; darin) were talking to a &quot;ticket broker&quot; (hello, scalper?!) who said they weren't doing anything illegal.  okay, explain to me how buying up hundreds of tickets to a show, any show, at regular price &amp; then selling them for 5x the price is legal?!  it's also unethical &amp; immoral, imo.  and it's breaking the little girls' hearts!!!  grrrr.  
<br /><br />scalpers are right up there in my crap list as scammers!

<br /><br />my friend summer's friend pearl had something in her blog on myspace that really touched me.  i tried to copy &amp; paste it on here, but it wouldn't paste.  and my computer is not letting me open multiple windows right now!  so, i will just say that it was about missing someone who'd died  &amp; how they are never really gone because they are in our hearts.  and it got me thinking about daddy.  of course, i think of him every day, sometimes all day long.  halloween is coming up, and he will have been gone a year, and i really can't believe it's been that long.  
<br /><br />i know, tho, he is so much happier with the Lord than he ever was here - and he was a REALLY HAPPY GUY!   i credit him w/ my good points, i praise Jesus that i am his daughter.  i'm so thankful for the time i got to spend with him.  i'm grateful for every hug, every road trip, every card, every stuffed animal, every $20 slipped to me when mom wasn't looking.  heh.  i'm grateful that he married mom, and loved her, and taught her how to relax, even tho she forgot for a time.  the memory of him is what keeps us going, when it hurts too much, when we miss him horribly.  knowing him has made us all much better people than we ever would have been without him.  
<br /><br />i love him and i miss him but i can't wish him back because that would be taking away from the awesomeness i know he is experiencing now.  and i know i will see him soon, in terms of eternity.  30 or 40 or 60 years from now is just a blink.  : )

		<document id="1c5b62513735344f67edbb929a0eb608" url=""><![CDATA[Celebreality<br/><br/>there's a lot going on this week in celebreality.
<br /><br />Britney Spears -  a judge has ruled that she no longer is allowed to have visitation w/ her boys, because she has chosen not to comply w/ court orders.  what is it going to take for her to realize that the courts have the power to keep her from her boys?  apparently after the ruling she went out tanning &amp; to get dinner at a drive thru.  now, criticizing her for getting dinner seems dumb, but i think the objection is more her attitude - very chipper, joking w/ the paparazzi &amp; all.  for all her talk of loving her boys &amp; being a good mom &amp;  whatever, she is NOT showing it right now.  many of you know that my parents were foster parents for much of my teen/young adult years.  i've seen so many parents not comply with court mandates in order to see their children, and i've never understood it.  if you love your kids, if you want to be a part of their lives, wouldn't you do EVERYTHING in your power to do so?  if the court tells you to stop drinking, to have a curfew, to take drug tests, DO IT!  it's not like they didn't have reason to order these things. i really hope she pulls herself together &amp; does  what she needs to do so those boys can have both their parents in their lives.  again, i must say -who ever would have thought that kevin federline would be  the better parent?!  *shock*
<br /><br />Halle Berry vs. the paparazzi -  a couple days after announcing her pregnancy,  halle was apparently being  chased by photographers, and was pushed into a wall in her car.  did the photographers attempt to help her or back off?  no, they scattered like the rats they are, until the tow truck arrived &amp; then they took pictures of the damaged car being hauled away, selling their story as &quot;halle berry drives recklessly&quot; or whatever.   WTH is wrong w/ these ppl?!?!  is the blood lust so strong in them that their ability to reason completely flees?  did they learn nothing from what happened to princess diana?  the answer to that is a very loud NO.  they didn't learn anything.  they don't care who they hurt, as long as they get their $1000 photo.  to a certain extent, i will agree that as a celebrity, you know you are going to be photographed  and should be prepared for that.  at functions like the emmy's or a premier!  NOT being chased down the road when you're on your way to the gym!  how do you prepare for that?  i've seen the swarms of photographers surrounding celebs' cars when they're trying to leave a restaurant.  they have bodyguards to get them TO the car, but what do you do when  you can't drive away?  that's how those photogs got run over  before.  and then the media liked to blame .. .lindsey, was it?  i don't even remember.  but in that particular instance, she was not driving recklessly!  she was just trying to get home.  yeesh.  
<br /><br />Ellen DeGeneres &amp;  Iggy  -  OMG, seriously!  this one really irritates me, too.  ellen adopted a dog, but the dog did not get along w/ her cats.  so she did something that, imo, was very sweet &amp; responsible.  she found the dog a new home, w/ a family who loved him &amp; took very good care of him.  she did not abandon the dog.  she did not return the dog.  she found the dog a home, which is what her intention was when she  adopted the dog!!!   apparently, this was not good enough for the lady who runs moms &amp; mutts.  she took the dog away from the loving family, and scolded ellen for breaking her contract.  ohhhkay... i understand having the contract to protect the interest of the dog.  i really do.  however, if the dog is obviously in a good &amp; loving home, isn't that the whole point??  isn't that what you have your business for?  *scoff*  apparently, it is not.   
<br /><br />so!  that is my entertainment news for the evening.  *hugs*  have a good one!!

<br /><br />i am so grateful for all the Lord has blessed me with.  right now i am struggling financially a lot, and emotionally a little less.   but i am thankful that i have running water, and heat when i need it (the money to pay for the heat, not sure!).  blankets and a warm coat for when i can't turn the heat on.  a mother who helps me w/ groceries and gas and things when she can.  and takes me to dinner or movies to hang out &amp; have fun!  a brother who mows my lawn and helps with other things when i need them.  friends to talk to and share with.  praise the Lord for His blessings! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />he gave the greatest hugs.
<br /><br />he loved the Lord with all his heart.
<br /><br />he liked roller coasters and stephen king books.  he bought me harry potter books and then read them himself.  he took me to the movies, even if i'd already seen it, he'd go w/ me again.  he went to the HP movies at the IMAX  &amp; bought me popcorn.  (and fell asleep thru part of one..LOL)
<br /><br />he was a wonderful husband.  he took care of the kids while mom worked when they became foster parents.  he would take them on a saturday to the park or the family museum.  every anniversary he sent mom flowers.  every valentine's day she got chocolates.  
<br /><br />he was a wonderful father.  he'd take us on trips, ride the aforementioned roller coasters, snore so we couldn't sleep.  *laugh*  he didn't get mad when i totalled his brand new car on the I-74 bridge one winter.  he spoiled me (but i'm not rotten!).  he bought me my Christmas Penguin one day when he'd taken one of the kids on a field trip to the dollar store.  it was waiting for me on my couch, looking so adorable.  : )  he always picked out awesomely funny birthday cards and valentine's cards and sometimes halloween cards.  he wasn't afraid of the hallmark store!  he chaperoned on class field trips.  he encouraged phil in baseball &amp; basketball &amp; bowling &amp; fishing &amp; golf.  : )  phil liked to hang out w/ him as much as i did!  
<br /><br />i could write for days and never explain everything i loved, love, about him! 
<br /><br />a year ago today, i knew he was dying, but i didn't think it would be tomorrow.  he &amp; mom were planning a golfing outing to arizona.  
<br /><br />a year ago tomorrow was the scariest day of mom's life.  i was at work, unaware of what was going on until mom called me.  i went to lunch w/ the team &amp; was having fun.  stupid fun.  i sat in the car in the parking lot of the hospital, leaving a message for dave that i wasn't sure i'd be in the next day because they'd brought daddy to the hospital.  i went up to the room they said they were bringing him to.  i texed mary, i think.  i was working on something, just waiting.  not really scared.  i didn't know how bad it was going to get.  i didn't know mom was going to have to fight an orderly wearing a pirate &quot;tattoo&quot;.   
<br /><br />i didn't know i was going to watch my hero die in just minutes.  
<br /><br />i remember him every day, all day long.  all night long sometimes, because i get to see him in dreams.  tomorrow mom &amp; i are going to hang out.   i don't know if we will talk about it.  i hope we do, i want to talk about him with her.  
<br /><br />if you think of it, please keep our family in your prayers tomorrow.  thanks.

<br /><br />have y'all heard about this whole Dog the bounty hunter scandal?  he apparently was talking to his son on the phone, and made some negative comments about his son's gf, who is black, using rather harsh language.  for some reason, his son was recording the convo, and leaked it to the press.  because of some of the language, they are now calling Dog a racist.  now, i haven't heard the tape.  but knowing that Dog has always treated black ppl w/ the same level of respect as native ppl or white ppl or purple ppl (should there be any) i find it hard to believe he is racist.  playing devil's advocate here, perhaps he was unhappy w/ this girl for reasons completely unrelated to her race, and chose to use the n word for the same reason many (if not most) ppl use the phrase &quot;son of a btch&quot; to refer to someone they dislike, or &quot;btch&quot; when referring to a female who has done something to make them mad.  why is the media so quick to jump on the &quot;racist&quot; bandwagon?   
<br /><br />i think it's because this country is obsessed with being &quot;politically correct.&quot;  and it really needs to stop, because it really irritates me!    if someone acts against someone else because of their skin color, that's stupid and should be met w/ disdain for that behavior.  but if someone gets pissed off at another person based on their actions, attitudes or behaviors -regardless of skin color, sex, age, etc., then person A should be able to express that frustration any way they choose!  (okay, barring something illegal like assault of murder, of course!)   *sigh*  the illogic of it is making my head hurt.  
<br /><br />have a good night, and hey - try not to piss anyone off, okay?   Jesus loves you &amp; i do, too!  : )

<br /><br />when the cold comes, in this part of the country, it means my birthday is soon (only 13 more days!) and then thanksgiving (mmm, turkey!) and then Christmas!!!!  i love holidays.  *bounce*  this year i'm a little bummed because i'm not sure how much money i'm going to have to shop for gifts, but i have a good idea of what i'm getting everyone, if i can!  i love to give presents.  of course, i also love to GET presents.  *laugh*  
<br /><br />so, more on this Dog saga.  a more comprehensive version of the tape has been made public, and it is as i suspected.  most of the conversation was not racist or even inflamatory.  Dog has issues w/ his son's gf for reasons other than her race, and - while he shouldn't have chosen to use that certain word - it sounds like he has rights to be upset.  *sigh*  it's crazy what can happen w/ a tape recorder!
<br /><br />anyway, stay warm!  i'm off to cuddle up in my blankets!   (after Bulletproof Monk - i can't resist this movie!)

<br /><br />help me understand, please &amp; thank you!
