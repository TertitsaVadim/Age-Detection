<br />Writing has been a hobby for me. I resumed it with my Hindi short stories and articles on subjects of my passion, History, Art and Literature. One of my stories was selected for Inter college competition. Though, not chosen for prize, yet my college (Agrawal College, Jaipur) honored with a certificate. I also made an attempt to give form of a novel to a real life story based on my Grandfather’s sister’s tragic life being kidnapped and placed in court of that time Maharaja Madhosingh of Jaipur. It was like an ordinary brother’s struggle to free his sister from the harem of his own king. But when I gave its manuscript to my Hindi teacher to seek his review and improvement, he never returned it. Being my teacher I could never do any more than reminding to return my manuscript. This he never did.
<br />For writers, the biggest problem is to get his work published. If you are not established writer no one will come forward to show day light to your manuscript. After completing study when I became Assistant Curator of Museum of Saputara, I got a break through and one of my study on a very interesting tribal musical instrument Pawari got published in commoarative issue in memory of Herman Guts of Baroda Museum Bulletine. Being it my first article in the English.
<br />Then I started writing in the Gujarati. My first big task in the Gujarati was to edit a complete souvenir on the Dang Durbar an annual funfair in the Dangs district, viz., Ranrahi- a tribal lexicon means the forest dwellers. 
<br />Fortunately, my job in the tribal belt proved to be an advantageous opportunity to learn fabulous aspects of human activities unknown to the people living in urbanized world. My first hand information received recognition as important for authentic and scientific sourcing the ethnology of South Gujarat. Various social science organizations used to invite me for reading papers and on other side I became contact man for researchers. My these papers seldom got published but I became an orator.
<br />I, being a professional museum man, too got good opportunity to pen my experiments, observations and experiences in the subject of Museology. Journal of Indian Museums, published my articles on Museology. Among them a little heavy weight article has been- So You Want A Good Diorama. This is an only fully discussed article on diorama making.       
<br />At Dharampur, I started writing about budding contemporary and experimental artists on suggestions of Surat based master artists and columnist, Vasudev  Smart. 
<br />I longed to get my work published by my own department (Department of Museums, Gujarat State), but could not succeed in convincing to my director. Later, I learned the reason. My director used his position and funds for publications of his own works so he would not in mood to give platform to his subordinate. But my works got regularly published by other agencies. This was enough for me.
<br />My first priced publication was a Gujarati compilation of earlier published articles on some confusing questions regarding history-archaeology of Kutch- Kuchchha Samskriti : Samsyao Ane Samadhan. It had well researched solutions to eleven problems.
<br />As there was no local journal in the English I translated my work in the Gujarati  and used to get published them. But finally my monumental works were published by Delhi based publisher in the English only.
<br />I wished if our departmental bulletin could be restarted which got stopped since 1993. It  could have been the best suitable place to inform world about the fantastic aspects of art, history, archaeology, anthropology, traditional crafts and literature of Gujarat with minutest details, scholarly analysis and interpretations.

Status of Western Ksatrapas. II. Political history: 5. Founder of Castana Family Ysamotika of Ghsamotika? 6. Conquests of Castana. 7. Castana's Rule and Administration. 8. Castana's achievements. 9.

<br />&quot;Role of the Sakas or Scythians in history of the Western India of the Early Christian period; has been a desired, subject among historians. Though, there are many aspects and characters of Saka History, the author, found to the character of interesting Castana sternly underestimated and neglected by the historians. Castana built his own empire conquering almost complete West and North West India. He was simply a Ksatrapa but became Mahaksatrapa. He united the scattered forces of the foreign born nationalities those who had lost their power with defeat of Nahapana by Gotamiputra. He tried to Indianise the foreign born nationalities by adopting Saivism, encouraging Samskrita and pursuing matrimonial relations with Satavahanas. He founded the Saka rule in India so firmly that they ruled for four centuries. He can be credited to start the solar calendar of Sakas in India which is now our national calendar. Though we do not find his Gold Coins but we know that the trade and commerce were flourishing in full swing during his period. The Ports of Makaran, Sindha, Kutch, Saurashtra, Gujarat and Konkan were very busy of harboring Indian as well as foreign vessels. Castana was like Napoleon who rose from a soldier to emperor. Rather he was more dynamic in founding his dynasty then later who failed miserably in this.
<br />Respite, many more interesting aspects in this period of Indian history in general and western India in particular, e.g., the progress of art, culture, society, literature have been discussed in details, which took place due to prosperity of people in reign of Western Ksatrapas of 1 and 2 cent. viz. Castana and Rudradamna.&quot; (jacket)

This has affected the museums, their collections and research works bringing them to a point of stand still.
<br />The basic problem is that most of the museums do not have adequate staff leave aside the technically sound staff. In our state Gujarat I sight instances where there is no staff at all and museums are run by non skilled wagers under remotely vigilance of a caretaker from Directorate who holds charge of these museums in addition of his regular job.
<br />Then comes, the poor situation of the proper training of museology or museography of the staff. There are number of museology courses now throughout the length and breadth of nation compare to the olden days in spite of that, there prevails dearth of trained museologists. Why? The reason is simple. When you do not have adequate staff to go, then  to whom you will asked to get training or when government is not appointing staff in museums to whom then the authorities will ask to go for training, or how come museum have fresh trained staff?
<br />Where there the administrator cadre directors are there, their lack of knowledge of exact requirements of museum as an institution seldom leave room to understand the human resource development of the staff responsible to take care of museums. For them their knowledge does not excess then a job of Sub Divisional Magistrate or a Tehsildar. 
<br />The existing caretaker staff even lacks the academic qualification too. Suppose if a Jr. Clerk is in charge of a museum, he would not be qualified as a curator with post graduate degree in art or archaeology. Therefore, he cannot do cataloguing; he can’t identify exhibits, he cannot conduct research on museum collections. So he cannot tell the visitors the massage behind any exhibit of his museum.
<br />This puts the research aspect of museums in to margins.
<br />Several museums have stopped their research bulletins. Because they do not carry out research and they do not have a well versed editor to publish, who in olden days used to be the director of museum department.
<br />The museum publications are limited up to only a beautifully crafted polychromic booklet or folder.
<br />So far the serious research in the field of numismatics, epigraphy, iconography, ethnology, natural sciences are concerned, what we see the curators of museums conduct in the TV channels like Discovery or National Geography, seems alien. 
<br />The research has become only responsibility of universities. But they hardly care for the museums. Because it is a tool for them and not an aim, as it is for museologists.
<br />The result is very damaging. You can find number of mistake in museum labeling. Because, no knowledge is there to learn the mistake. Where the question does lies to correct? Thousands and thousands of coins are in museum reserve collections are dumped without indexing, cataloguing or detail study. We do not know where our history might get a jerking twist if somebody reads them?
<br />The typical irresponsible nature of a government museum staff too is very serious hurdle in conducting museum research, viz., when an outsider scholar makes approach for seeing collections in reserve. They either will make hundreds of excuse to avoid or would create hundreds of hurdle to fulfill. So the collection will remain again unstudied.
<br />This lack of information regarding museum collection, harms museums very badly.Because, museums cannot boost to show the visitors anything special what we call <em>nayaab</em>. If some new information regarding collection comes on publicity the visitors will be tempted to see museum. That even might attract international scholar world.
<br />In fact all the government must take care of their museums. Museums are place where people come to enjoy with family. Kids pass their time. This keeps them engaged on holidays. Instead of vesting time, or doing unsocial activities, museum provide rescue to the citizens as a light entertainment. Then on museums hundreds of tourism based activities are run. Like, job of rickshaw driver, refreshment eateries, hawkers, toy sellers, balloon seller, sugarcane juice seller etc. These makes frisking business outside every museum. Even a museum without entry fee can help generating revenue by taxing the hawkers by municipalities who stands outside the museums. Leave aside the foreign exchange by tourist from abroad.

<br />the museums in states are now seriously getting themselves
<br />deteriorated on account of not the lack of funds but due to state
<br />governments’ policies of not recruiting the staff for any government
<br />office including museums. Therefore most of the museums are not having
<br />curators. The other technical staff too is getting day by day retired
<br />and the total ban on new recruitment has made the vacant places
<br />abolished. The posts like chemists to governments do not want to fill
<br />up without whom the whole valuable collections are severely
<br />deteriorating. The most dangerous aspect of government indifference is
<br />towards the research part. When there are no curators who are going to
<br />interpret collections.
<br />It’s not that the funds are poor, but governments have made to bring
<br />down the number of employees 0 at class 4, class 3 and class 2 levels.
<br />So now there are no guides, no photographers, no catalogers, no
<br />chemists, no taxidermists, no librarians, and gallery assists. Even
<br />not the clerks in the museums owned by states.
<br />The higher authorities just want everything to do by out sourcing
<br />without any discrimination of the feasibility or possibility or the
<br />nature and requirement of the profession.
<br />Many states have now merely administrative heads to look after museums
<br />and not professional heads.
<br />The states spend lacks on gallery designing but a dime to maintain it.
<br />The science museums luckily somehow are safe on account of their
<br />popular appeal, but heritage museums are dyeing fast.
<br />Think it in your Museum Association conference.
<br />In fact Government of India should set up a committee to review the
<br />situations of state owned museums.

<br /><br />Since prehistory period Western India has been a settling soil for the various races, tribes and communities of the Old World on account of its straight and easily accessible routes from Central south Easter Asia and Australia from south eastern side.
<br /><br />The Central Asian Communities, like, Indo-Iranians, Scythians, Turks etc. did come here from West. Tribal Heritage In Western India With Special Reference To Mavchis Of DangsTherefore here we come across all kind of races. The Negros as Siddis of Junagadh, Kutch and Rajanpur of Bharuch, the Mongoloid Luhanas, Caucasoid Scythians as shepherds like Rabaries and Ahiras and the Proto Australoids Bhils and other tribal aptly embody the mosaic of earth’s all foremost races.
<br /><br />In this museum like land of racial variation, some of the communities for their cultural traditions stand very distinguish. They are the Rabaries of Kutch, Siddis of the Panchmahals and the Mavchis of South Gujarat. They present divergent visit of ethnology.
<br /><br />THE TRIBAL HERITAGE IN WESTERN INDIA: with Special Reference to Mavchis of Dangs is an outcome of my vast experience as an ethnologist and cultural enthusiast, being curator in the Dept. of Museums of Government of Gujarat since 1977.
<br /><br />In general, it touches most of the aspects of life of a tribal in Western India and the Mavchis of South Gujarat in particular, by reciting an unhindered saga which starts with prehistory and then taking a complete tour of social enigma, occupational activities, religion, art and literature ends at recreation and amusement. There is no much muddle of reference after references from erudite studies but rather it just interprets only fundamental first hand information collected from the deep forests, terrains of mountains and smoking shanties of the Dangs.

<br /><br />Dr. Koppar, D. H. born in 1923, in Dharwad district of Karnataka, graduated in English literature and History, and had his Ph. D. degree in Social and Economic Conditions under the Hoysolas in 1958, under guidance of Prof. R S Panchmukhi from Karnataka University, passed away from this mortal world on 10th March 2010 at his daughter’s house in Anand, Gujarat.
<br />He became Curator of the Lady Wilson Museum (LWM) at Dharampur in 1951, when the museum was under department of museums of Bombay State. Before this he spent considerable time in Mumbai. His command over the English composition was great. But his services- formerly in Bombay state and later in Gujarat made him well acquainted in the Marathi and the Gujarati languages. 
<br />When he joined LWM, it was basically an industrial art museum and almost like a store house of curio kind of exhibits which were collected by Native ruler Maharana Shri Vijaydevji of Dharampur, during his tours of European and Asian countries, he made in 1927 to 1931.  It was Dr. Koppar who first time thought to give space in it to the local tribal culture. As Dharampur is land of forest dwelling ethnic groups, like the Dhodias, the Naykas, the Kukanas and the Kolghas. 
<br />He studied not only the local ethnology but also that of India and abroad. He was endorsed the job of studying the ethnological collection of Museum and Picture Gallery Baroda, viz., the African and Papuan.
<br />He made a drastic alteration in the Jubilee Hall where the museum of Dharampur is located and by removing mezzanine lobby, he got constructed a ceiling and thus got a two storied halls. Though, it called on him great criticism, but he got double space where now he could made Anthropological section.
<br />Fortunately, Dharampur, though a small town, was having a skilled artist cum sculptor, Balaram Gajare. He came to be handy to Koppar in his curetting the anthropology section.
<br />Slowly both set to organize anthropology of India, Gujarat and Dharampur, mainly in dioramic methods.
<br />Thus, the Lady Wilson Museum became Anthropological museum. Koppar put his efforts to publicize it in this discipline too. He used to read papers in conferences of Museum Association of India on his experiments in ethnological display. 
<br />It took him almost twelve years to make his dream true.
<br />The luck too favored him. Government of Gujarat decided to have a museum at newly schedule hill station at Saputara, in the Dangs about 120 km from Dharampur. It is again a tribal area and so government too was keen to make an anthropological museum. In 1971, Koppar started with a dormitory room. This got Koppar more fame as anthropological museologist.
<br /><br />His efforts inspired Museums at Surat and Gujarat Vidya Pith, Ahmadabad. The Tribal Research Institute of Vidyapith adopted the complete line of display of Dr. Koppar at LW museum Dharampur, the dioramic method, but little more environmentally.
<br />In 1972 he stood to be Director of Museums Gujarat State but lost against Dr. S. K. Bhowmik.
<br />After his retirement in 1981, he got fellowship from Indian Council of Social Science to study tribal art of India. For three years he was with Centre for Social Research at Surat.
<br />Dr. Koppar being good scholar penned number of articles in various journals. His books - the TRIBAL ART OF DANGS (1971) and FORGOTTEN ART OF INDIA (1989), both published by Dept. of Museums, Gujarat State are monumental volumes of his deep knowledge of tribal culture.
<br />My interaction with Koppar was first when he was holding charge of Director of Museums at Baroda and wanted an exhibition to curate. In fact I was then studying Museology at M.S. University. My Professor Bedekar took me to help the museum staff. I painted a huge background for the semi diorama of a tribal hut.
<br />Later, in 1977 I got appointed as Astt. Curator, at Saputara Museum, and met him at Dharampur 
<br />We together attended International Anthropological Congress in 1978 as official delegates of Government of Gujarat. 
<br />Finally I descended him as Curator LW Museum Dharampur on his retirement.
<br />Dharampur owes him for putting her on international directory of museums, one of the best tourist attractions, and the District Science Center which was proposed by him to then Secretary Education, K. P. Yagnik, to establish and recommended Saroj Ghosh – Director General of the National Council of Science Museums to visit Dharampur. So Dharampur has District Science Centre. 
<br />It was he who noticed the aesthetic superiority of the Warli Paintings and introduced Jeevya Soma Mase, the iconic Warli painter from Thane, near Dharampur. He invited Rajiv Sethi and asked him to send Mase in Festival of India in 1978 at France.
<br />Similarly it was he who only knew the wooden mask maker of village Lavkar, the unique tribal artist of Dharampur.

Do they not understand the value in right perspective? <em>‘Do’ bachane ke liye ‘so’ kho denge.</em> The logic, I feel is their mind set that they care for institution better. But it’s all superficial. In total they harm institutions unrecoverable. Something like happening with me.  I had requested to equip my office with computer and necessary systems. After 1 year’s lapse, it reached to HO. But not being transporting to my office for fear of fair. It already passed 2 months. I shall retire by September 2011. I know after it the post will never be filled. So the work being a curator I planned to complete with computer will halt. The ideal instrument if could have been handed over to me I could completed at least a portion of my task in two months. The fun is this that even after such a loss to institution, I am not aware when will the computer unit will arrive at my office. Jai ho!!!

I too was among guest speakers.
<br />It was a very thought provoking and guiding event for the all urban development planners or those who are in this field. 
<br />As usual with all expert discourses, with fine publications and yummy lunch after dispersing from the meet, an idea kept me stuck in my mind-
<br />&quot;How did this meet benefit to our monuments?&quot;
<br />If the hefty budget allocated to organize the meet could have been utilized in real conservation and restoration of any of the dilapidated monuments of Jamnagar it in fact could have been far more befitting to the motto of <em>Swarnim Gujarat</em>.

Located in Istanbul's Çukurcuma neighbourhood, famous for its second-hand and antique shops, the building presents hundreds of objects &quot;collected&quot; by Pamuk's fictional character Kemal from his most recent novel, The Museum of Innocence. After the death of his lover, Fusun, Kemal obsessively collects objects that describe and define both her and an Istanbul that has long perished. The building housing the museum purports to be Fusun's family home, later acquired by Kemal so that he can spend the rest of his life among their shared memories.
<br /><br />A result of Pamuk's meticulous efforts over the last decade, the museum presents its objects in 83 different cabinets, corresponding to the novel's 83 chapters. In the entrance hall, visitors are greeted by the image of a large spiral, representing Aristotle's concept of time, which the novel devotes many pages to describing. A massive panel filled with 4,213 cigarette butts, supposedly smoked by Fusun, is placed on one wall. Many cabinets feature video and sound installations depicting 1950s Istanbul. But the place is decisively not a museum of the city: many newspaper clippings, ads and &quot;historic&quot; photographs have been fabricated to represent specific characters and scenes from the novel and are by no means authentic objects.
<br /><br />Pamuk worked with several curators and young Turkish artists to find a way of realising the project, which he had in mind ever since the 1990s, when he bought the house. He has filled it with many surprises for his readers, including fictional obituaries of characters from his previous novels The Black Book, The New Life and The Silent House (which will appear in English later this year) and some of his own personal photographs. Glasses of raki, plates of half-eaten boreks and other local curiosities are also on display. Finally, visitors can see Kemal's bedroom as well as the original manuscript of the novel.
