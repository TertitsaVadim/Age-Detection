<br /><br />In spring, for adapting to the<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNTI0XzE2MDgwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">growth</a> </strong>of Yang-qi, people need to enhance exercise and do some aerobic exercise in the outdoors and nature, which is helpful to exhale the old and inhale the new and stretch muscles and bones.

<br /><br />3. Drinking Tea for Health care
<br /><br />Traditional Chinese Medicine takes tea as the first-rank substance for life cultivation. Tea can replenish moisture in our body and advance metabolism; besides, tea contains microelement and compound that are beneficial to our health. One attraction is that scented tea is the optimum selection in spring.

As the blood circulation amount in the digestive tracts increase after meals, substantial objectionable constituents in the cigarette are absorbed in the body which would damage the liver, brain and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNTI0XzE2MDgxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">heart</a></strong> vessels.

<br /><br />Substantial tannic acid contained in the tea would combine with the iron element and zinc element in the food to produce substance that is hard to be dissolved. Consequently, the iron element would lose. But if we drink tea one hour after meals, the situation mentioned above would not occur.

As a result, the digestive function of the gastrointestinal tracts would decline.

Especially for the elders, who have problems about the decline of the heart function, cardiovascular sclerosis or the functional disorders of reflex regulation for the blood pressure, would often suffer from blood pressure declining if taking walk after meals.
<br /><br />3. Don't hurry to drive. 
<br /><br />As a matter of fact, accident can easily happen on those drivers who have just finished their meals. That's because the stomach and intestines need much blood to aid digestion, therefore, under such circumstance, transient ischemia of the brain <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNTI0XzE2MDgxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">organs</a></strong> can be caused easily, thus operation errors may occur.

And the white cells in the body would not increase if people eat raw foods before cooked foods, which is helpful for protecting the immune system and strengthening the ability to prevent diseases. But this kind of protection would not occur by eating fruits after meals. Besides, the fructose contained in fruits can not be absorbed by the intestines when people eat fruits after meals, thus, it would ferment in the stomach, causing uncomfortable feelings such as abdominal distension and diarrhea, etc. Therefore, it is better to eat fruits about one hour after meals.

<br /><br />Song style of men attracts women around by using the ways of hide the elegance in the depression and the grievance and of the unprincipled tolerance of his wife. Xiao Li and Juanzi are attracted by Song Jianping because of sympathy. Ultimately, both of these two women involve in his marital conflict, suffering from insult from his wife Lin Xiaofeng.

In this film, he has two sides of personality which include caring others in front of the outsiders and keeping alone, tolerating to refuse, retreating to indifferent, defending to attack in his<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNDI4XzE2MDAzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">marriage</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Revelation 3: People lack of communication instead of trust in marriage
<br /><br />Lacking of communication is Song Jianping’s fault, while lacking of trust is Lin Xiaofeng’s fault. Whose fault is more serious? Think it over, in the marriage lacking of communication, lacking of care and sharing, it’s common that a person makes trouble to force both sides to force both sides to communicate and share. Of course, what they share may be the sadness. But sharing sadness is much better than share nothing because at least it looks like a marriage.

What’s the reason and how to solve it?
<br /><br />Shanshan from Kanebo thinks that applying the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNDI4XzE2MDAyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">sunscreen</a></strong> is one of main reasons for acnes. 
<br /><br />LANCASTER in Professor Z makes clear that although the high SPF can protect us from the sun for a long period of time, it also can lead to poor permeability and high greasy degrees. So, do remember to discharge the makeup completely so as to prevent the problem of pores block in the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50Y21kaXNjb3ZlcnkuY29tL1RDTS1Ub3BpYy9pbmZvLzIwMTEwNDI4XzE2MDAyLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">skin</a></strong>.
<br /><br />How to measure SPF and PA in the sunscreen? Is there a international uniform standard? How to choose a sunscreen successfully?
<br /><br />Shanshan from Kanebo points out that though SPF is tested by each brand themselves, ultimately it must be tested through health inspection. So, the consumers can choose to the sunscreen marked by special purpose.
