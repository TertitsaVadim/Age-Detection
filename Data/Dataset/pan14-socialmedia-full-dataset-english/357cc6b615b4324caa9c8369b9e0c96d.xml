<br /><br />Music is a sculpture that interacts with the space it inhabits, the personalities that create it, and it mathematically interacts with the passage of time.  It is constantly changing, evolving...
<br /><br />Sometimes it is grueling and painful. Like being an athlete who in the last mile of the race.  You've played for almost 4 hours, your shoulder aches, your hands are succumbing to RSI injuries finally, and your focus is not what it was in hour one...so you work to stay on your game.  After the gig you pack your wrists with ice and Salonpas pads...and rest.  Not every gig is like this...but it reminds me that I am finite, and this skill I have worked to develop may not last forever.
<br /><br />It becomes wonderfully intense when you are aware that you are channeling something greater than yourself...that you are just a conduit.  That the band is now functioning as something far greater than the individuals in it.  You wonder where this &quot;playing&quot; is coming from, because it is so much bigger than you...and you appreciate it as it happens.
<br /><br />Sometimes it is depressing....some scenes to illustrate the point:
<br /><br />....the time my friend's tube amp tipped over and punched through the window of his Chevy blazer on the on ramp of a highway as we were coming home from a gig at 2 AM...my car, following close behind, was showered in glass shards... 
<br /><br />....breaking up with a boyfriend, and finding out while I am on the road in North Carolina doing subbing work that my ATM card and checking accounts no longer work...he's closed our joint account...I've got $135  in cash to my name, and I spend the gig wondering if he's changed the locks on the house.... 
<br /><br />...both basses AND my amp breaking during a major festival gig, far from home, one bass limps through the gig, the other is completely useless, the amp sending some god awful noisy signal through the DI out... 
<br /><br />...performing with the kids at a local mall (and the kids have prepared for weeks for this gig)....the mall management comes up to me and mid song, screams at me to my face, while I trying to sing, that the PA is too loud.  My hands are full, I'm singing, I'm playing...I can't reach the PA in 5 seconds or less...the mall managements' solution is to walk over to the power cable and yank it...in front of a growing crowd of parents, friends and passing shoppers...end of show.  We didn't even finish the first song. 
<br /><br />So that, my friends, can be the ugly side of gigging.
<br /><br />On the bright side...there are all the wonderful folks I would have never met if I hadn't taken this path.  That list, is simply too long for this blog.  
<br /><br />Please check out my friend and fellow bassist Andy Long. He's just released a bass trio with Alun Vaughan and Graham Clark called  Gymnopedie No. 1.  Also check out  Andy's version of  &quot;Abide With Me&quot;.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fprofile.myspace.com%2Findex.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3Duser.viewprofile%26amp%3BfriendID%3D54696469"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=54696469</a>
<br /><br />We are working on a recording project together right now...so keep checking back for updates and a release.
<br /><br />Take care and have a good week,
<br /><br />Brittany

Here is an update on the fight to save it.  This is excerpted from a letter I received from Pandora:
<br /><br />Hi, it's Tim again, 
<br /><br />I wanted to thank you again for your extraordinary support in the fight to save Internet radio and Pandora. Thanks to the overwhelming number of calls you made, letters you faxed, and emails you sent, the Internet Radio Equality Act is fast gaining momentum in the House of Representatives (63 sponsors and growing). It's nothing short of remarkable for this to happen in such a brief period of time - almost unprecedented.   
<br /><br />Last Friday a Senate version of the bill was introduced by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sam Brownback (R-KS): <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savenetradio.org%2F071510-wyden.pdf"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.savenetradio.org/071510-wyden.pdf</a>. This is a promising development, but we need your help again. I know we're asking a lot, but the stakes couldn't be higher and the fight is not over.    
<br /><br />Please call the offices of your Senators and ask them to co-sponsor the Internet Radio Equality Act, S. 1353. 
<br /><br />Senator John Warner: (202) 224-2023
<br />Senator Jim Webb: (202) 224-4024    
<br /><br />Visit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.savenetradio.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.savenetradio.org</a> to keep up on our fight to save Internet radio. There are some powerful testimonials there from musicians who have found their audience through Internet radio.   
<br /><br />We are deeply moved by your support. Thank you.  
<br /><br />-Tim Westergren
<br />(Pandora founder) 
<br /><br />The phone numbers will only be of use to folks residing in Virginia.  Please look up the numbers for your Senators and give 'em a ring.
<br /><br />Thanks for all the supportive notes regarding my last blog on gigging...it's the little things like those notes that keep me going!
<br /><br />Take care,
<br /><br />Brittany

One of my students likes this song quite a bit, and has already got me teaching sections of the tune to him.  
<br /><br />This was written on an Epiphone Jack Cassidy 4 string bass with a Digitech Jam Man looping sampler.  It sounds best performed on my Rickenbacker 4003 or my Hohner B2V,  but the Jack Cassidy is the easiest bass to tap on of the three.
<br /><br />There are several loops occuring here.  Loop one is a tapped bassline with 2 tapped harmonics acting as a drone.  My left hand taps the bass line while my right hand taps the harmonics.
<br /><br />Loop two is the melody part.  
<br /><br />Loop three is the chordal section.
<br /><br />Loop four is a counter melody to the chordal section.
<br /><br />Enjoy, and as always your coments are welcome.

<br /><br />Happy Memorial Day weekend, everyone.
<br /><br />I have returned from my trip home, and I am trying to get caught up.  There is a whirlwind of activity here.  I guess Grandpa put in a good word for me.  So here is all the news from LadyBass Music....
<br /><br />Summer Classes: 
<br /><br />First off, two daytime group classes are starting in just a few weeks...group guitar and group bass!  This is the first time I have done either of these &quot;summer camp&quot; style classes, and I am very excited to have the opportunity to teach a group bass class.  These classes are ideal for the absolute beginner of either instrument, and I do invite folks of all ages to register.  Classes begin on June 13th, and are filling up quickly!  Follow the links below to register for the classes:
<br /><br />Group Bass Registration:

<br /><br />Private lesson registration for summer is already underway.   I plan on expanding my hours and offering daytime lesson spots throughout the summer of 2007.   So head over to my new teaching website for more information on private lessons.  You can pre-register for lessons and read up on my teaching studio policy.  Even if you are not planning on taking private lessons, you might want to check out the &quot;Links&quot; section...lots of good info in this section.

<br /><br />You can find course descriptions for the KG Parks and Recs classes under the news section on the homepage.
<br /><br />Feel free to pass this information on to other interested students.
<br /><br />KIDS ROCK:
<br /><br />The &quot;Kids Rock&quot; bands are getting ready for summer.   Celestial Immigrant has borrowed the Kids Rock folding stages and they are actively putting together rock shows with other King George bands at the Citizen's Center.  I have heard nothing but great things about these shows so far. 
<br /><br />Anything Goes is playing frequently through the Fredericksburg All Ages Shows.   Hopefully they will make an appearance at the Culpeper Rock Academy in the near future.
<br /><br />The Electric Gym Socks, JFJ and Anything Goes will be performing June 9th at 8 PM at Four Winds Campground's Youth Center.  Each band will do a 45 minute set.   The concert is free.  For more information, please go to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fourwindsclub.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.fourwindsclub.com</a>
<br /><br />For a short preview of what some of the Kids Rock bands have to offer, check out Pickers Supply &quot;Student Concert Series&quot; next week.  Banana Dust, JFJ and The Electric Gym Socks will play, along with many other talented student performers, on Thursday, May 31st, at 8 PM.  For more info and directions:

<br /><br />Other News:
<br /><br />If you have been following the Lady Bass Rookery posts, you will be happy to hear that the doves are raising their second brood this year in the hanging basket on my balcony.  Everyone has been enjoying watching the young birds develop.
<br /><br />The Syme fretless bass has been repaired and is back in operation with a new set of Lightwave pickups!  Thanks Chris Wilcox for all your help.  Lightwave rocks!  
<br /><br />Keep watching this page for new tracks.  I should be posting the results of a long distance recording project between myself and UK bassist Andy Long.  I've also been writing with the Digitech Jam Man...so I should have some completed tracks up shortly.
<br /><br />Keep an eye out....an upcoming issue of &quot;Making Music&quot; magazine will have an article on purchasing stringed instruments.  Yours truly was interviewed for tips on purchasing double basses.  There was also a good section on Mercury String Shop, located in Richmond, Virginia.  Thanks to Eve Carr for the opportunity. 
<br /><br />I will be posting some new video clips from Kids Rock shows and of myself...stay tuned!!
<br /><br />Thanks for checking out the news, and have a great Memorial Day weekend!

		<document id="10ae93fbc59e717fb91b005ecbd107c3" url=""><![CDATA[The end of internet radio comes on July 15th...<br/><br/>The RIAA has convinced our government to triple the royality rates the Internet radio stations have to pay...and then back collect fees from the last year.   This will effectively bankrupt the internet stations come Sunday, July 15th.  Monday morning, you will walk into your office, and Pandora, along with many other popular internet stations you listen to, will probably be off the air and out of business.  Meanwhile, traditional &quot;brick and mortar&quot; radio stations will continue to  pay the same royality rates they always have.
<br /><br />The bankruptcy of internet based radio will shut out the voices of  thousands of small, independent artists who are unable to get mainstream radio play due to the extremely commericalized playlists the stations are now using.  
<br /><br />I received this letter today from SaveNetRadio.org.  I encourage everyone to head over to this website for more resources and information on what can be done.
<br /><br />Read the letter below, and then follow this link:
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww3.capwiz.com%2Fsaveinternetradio%2Fhome%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www3.capwiz.com/saveinternetradio/home/</a>
<br /><br />Thank you for your time.
<br /><br />Greetings, 
<br /><br />Time and options are running out for Internet Radio.  Late this afternoon, the court DENIED the emergency stay sought on behalf of webcasters, millions of listeners and the artists and music they support.
<br /><br />UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS BY JULY 15th, the new ruinous royalty rates will be going into effect on Sunday, threatening the future of all internet radio.
<br /><br />We are appealing to the millions of Internet radio listeners out there, the webcasters they support and the artists and labels we treasure to rise up and make your voices heard again before this vibrant medium is silenced. Even if  you have already called, we need you to call again.
<br /><br />The situation is grave, but that makes the message all the simpler and more serious.  
<br /><br />PLEASE CALL YOUR SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES RIGHT AWAY and urge them to support the Internet Equality Act.  Go to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capwiz.com%2Fsaveinternetradio%2Falert_9738601.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.capwiz.com/saveinternetradio/alert_9738601.html</a> to find the phone numbers of your Senators and Representative.  
<br /><br />If they've already co-sponsored, thank them and tell them to fight to bring the bill to the floor for an immediate vote.  If the line is busy, please call back.  Call until you know your voice has been heard.  
<br /><br />Your voices are what have gotten us this far - Congress has listened.  Now, they are our only hope. 
<br /><br />We are outmatched by lobbying power and money but we are NOT outmatched by facts and passion and the power of our voices.
<br /><br />Again, please go to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capwiz.com%2Fsaveinternetradio%2Falert_9738601.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.capwiz.com/saveinternetradio/alert_9738601.html</a> to find the necessary phone numbers and make the call today. 
<br /><br />Thank you, 
<br /><br />The SaveNetRadio Campaign

<br /><br />There has been a lot going on lately. I will cover it all in a series of short blogs instead of one long one.
<br /><br />I completed work on a new track and it is available for upload.  The song was released about 6 days ago on Myspace and Soundclick, and it already made it to number 1 on the Soundclick.com Jazz Covers chart.    The song has also been added to the player on the &quot;Bass Players Wales&quot; Myspace page.
<br /><br />The track is a version of &quot;Autumn Leaves.&quot;  This is a trans-Atlantic, internet enabled, &quot;Myspace is entirely to blame&quot;  bass duet featuring bassists Andy Long (UK) and Brittany Frompovich (US). It is based on an arrangement of Autumn Leaves by NYC bassist, educator, and author Mike Dimin. 
<br /><br />Here's a guide to the players and their parts: 
<br /><br />Andy Long - bass lines in the verse sections, the bass solo, and most importantly...the idea to do this colloboration (thanks for the invite Andy!!) 
<br /><br />Brittany Frompovich - Vocals, congas, chord melody bass parts in the verse sections, bass line under Andy's solo, misc. percussion.... 
<br /><br />Andy is an accomplished bassist and writer, venturing into solo bass performance in recent years.  Check out his Myspace page at:
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Fsleepingplanet"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.myspace.com/sleepingplanet</a>
<br /><br />And his website at: 
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thirdbass.co.uk%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdbass.co.uk/</a>
<br /><br />The website has all kinds of treats....interviews with Norm Stockton, Steve Lawson, and John Paul Jones.  Don't forgot to check out his MP3s in the &quot;Bass Player&quot; section.  He has many great tracks centering on solo bass and multi-bass arrangements. 
<br /><br />And hey, if you feel really, really kind....I've posted this track on Soundclick.com....so please head over there and give it a listen.  Help us keep that number 1 spot a little longer!  The link to my Soundclick site is:
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundclick.com%2Fbands%2FsongInfo.cfm%3FbandID%3D643024%26amp%3BsongID%3D5535060"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundclick.com/bands/songInfo.cfm?bandID=643024&amp;songID=5535060</a>
<br /><br />&quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and two other tracks are available for purchase on Soundclick.  So if you really like what you hear, please consider purchasing a few downloads and support independant music.  Oh....and don't keep us a secret.  Go ahead and tell your friends. 
<br /><br />Signing off for now...thanks for listening!
<br /><br />Brittany

<br /><br />June 30th the Kids Rock program returned to Four Winds for another show at the Youth Center.
<br /><br />It was a great show, with Anything Goes returned sans drummer with an electric-folk set.   They played some new material and broke out the harmonica.   They even had a theremin solo on a tune.  Banana Dust played one of their strongest shows with a new bassist in the lineup, and the Electric Gym socks made their debut as a power trio. 
<br /><br />The gang from Banana Dust and Dylan Vasey from Anything Goes showed up early to unpack and set up.   As usual they did a great job getting the stage ready for the show.  This time, I brought some of my lighting equipment and they did a really great job rigging lights for the stage area!  
<br /><br />This show had a few nail-biter moments….the drummer from Banana Dust was stuck in holiday traffic on I-95 and had to arrive late for load in.   I got a super fast assist from the Hendricksons with moving the drum kit and other equipment over to 4 Winds.  
<br /><br />After the show, the battery on the van decided it had &quot;had it&quot; with our load out session and refused to start.  Fortunately I had my jump start box with me, so I was able to get the van going.  However, Troy and Becky Thom as followed me home to make sure the van was in good shape.  Thanks for that…it's still nice to know you've got a second pair of eyes watching, in case you've got a problem.   Kudos to Dylan….who we discovered can run really, really fast in order to catch a moving car if needed! 
<br /><br />And then the skies opened up, right as we finally pulled in at my apartment.  Not a sprinkle, not a thunderstorm.  Torrential downpour.  I had to take Dylan home through the rainstorm....it looked like the highway was &quot;flowing&quot; beneath the van.  I am so glad the Hendricksons unloaded the drum kit from their pickup into the apartment foyer before the rain started. 
<br /><br />We had a few rough pre-show practices, and some bands ran really short on practice time due to families juggling multiple obligations.   The rough practices were a little tough to get through…especially two days before the show.  However, everyone pulled together and really did an amazing job.   It was one of the best shows ever.  
<br /><br />Guitarist Mitchell Leippert wasn't able to make this show, as he is leaving the band and moving away this summer.   The Gym Socks adjusted their set list, and Tyler and I shared soloing responsibilities.  As they say, &quot;the show must go on.&quot;  And the kids did exactly that.   We all wish Mitchell lots of luck, and I understand he is forming a new band already with his younger brother, focusing on original material.  Kudos and best of luck to you and your family….we will miss you!!
<br /><br />More kudos to Dylan.  He's been taking live sound reinforcement lessons, in addition to his guitar lessons.  He has become responsible for setting up the 24 channel board, all the power amps, the effects, the snake….everything that is needed at the mixing board.   And he is doing a fine job running sound when I am unable to.  
<br /><br />And really, these shows couldn't happen without the kids diving in and learning as much as they have.   The gig is just where they go out and apply it.  The kids learn their set lists, and then they learn how to set up and tear down the stage…how to coil cables, the difference between and XLR and ¼ cable, how to get &quot;their sound&quot; quickly, how to DI a bass amp or mic a guitar amp, how to set up their amps and effects FAST, how to mic a drum kit, what a monitor is and what a main is, how to prepare for a show, how to do a sound check, and how to handle bad or unexpected situations that crop up (rain, heat, you turn your amp on and it doesn't work…etc. etc.).   And Dylan makes sure the PA system is up and running by the time the stage set up is complete.  And these kids are 13 – 15 years old, on average.   Wow.  Seriously, wow.  I couldn't do that when I was 15.  
<br /><br />I couldn't do these shows alone….they are too big now for me to do alone.  And I never really have done them alone.   In the beginning, it was Brandon and Matt and myself.  Brandon has gone to school, for his masters degree and Matt is a Scoutmaster on the weekend….but is still chompin' at the bit to do sound when he can. 
<br /><br />I give credit where it is due: kids are the muscle doing these shows.  Without them, it wouldn't happen.     
<br /><br />But wasn't that the goal all along? 
<br /><br />Thank you to Mr. Craig for staying while we were setting up and helping out with the whole process.  He actually created that nice roped off backstage area for the kids to use.  Thanks for that huge extra mile you went...esp. on your daughter's birthday! 
<br /><br />Thanks to Four Winds for hosting the event and providing the kids with free snacks.
<br /><br />Thanks to EVERYONE who stayed and helped with load out!!  There are a lot of &quot;soccer&quot; moms who have also learned how to coil cables properly….and can tell the difference between and XLR cable and a ¼&quot;  cable.  Guess we're going to rename you &quot;Rocker&quot; moms (I can see the kids runnin' with this...).  Put flames on the side panels of your mini vans and sedans.   
<br /><br />And thanks to the person who was shooting off fireworks at the end of the show.  Kudos to you....that was a nice touch.

<br /><br />Since I've had so much activity on my Soundclick site, I've posted some older tunes that were not available on Myspace anymore.  I am considering posting a few older tracks from &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; and &quot;War and Trespass,&quot; and a few live tracks from Acoustic Bandwidth shows.  Keep checking back for those releases.  You can purchase my MP3s from Soundclick.com as well.  The link to my page is:

<br /><br />Have a great day gang....I leave you with this quote from Pete Seeger...
<br /><br />&quot;The artist in ancient times inspired, entertained, educated his fellow citizens.  Modern artists have the additional responsibility - to encourage others to be artists.  Why?  Becasue technology is going to destroy the human soul unless we realize that each of us must in some way be a creator as well as a spectator or consumer.  Make your own music.  Tell your own stories.  Keep your soul.&quot;

<br /><br />Very much to my surprise and delight, my first fretted LightWave bass arrived yesterday.  (Thank you Chris Wilcox!)  I am now the proud owner of a Saber VL 5 string bass in TransAmber.  
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/16290603_12109098_14294235.jpg" />
<br /><br />These unique instruments are known for their ability to &quot;see&quot; the string, using optical pickups instead of electromagnets.  This increases the sustain of the instrument.  I quickly found (and loved) that the chordal material I have been working on has a stunning clarity on this bass.  It is very sensitive, which is wonderful for vibrato.  The neck is very fast and quite comfortable.  And, I am really pleased with the wide range of tones it can get.  I played it in a large ensemble tonight, and I was amazed at how solid sounding it was.  The bass cut through, and it still had the presence to anchor the group.
<br /><br />You can find more info about these basses at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lightwave-systems.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.lightwave-systems.com</a>. Also send me an email, and I will be happy to answer any questions.

<br /><br />The first gig with the Swing Kings went very well.  It has been years since I last played with a big band group.  This group is an eighteen piece band. The energy of a band that size can be a bit addictive.  
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/16290603_7278251_14294617.jpg" />
<br /><br />Good pic of the drummer.  I'm buried deep in a chart. looking far too focused....business as usual. 
<br /><br />Twin Brooks Winery has a regular concert series.  They have the concerts in a huge greenhouse with a terraced upstairs.  The upstairs has plenty of seating (200+ people), a wine tasting area, and a booth for purchasing wine.  The downstairs had some tables, a finished dance floor, and some bench seating next to the dance floor.  The staff hung oversized white Japanese lanterns from the glass ceiling.  Once the sun set, the glass building had a gentle, soft glow.  Despite all of the glass and reflective surfaces, we did not end up sounding muddy (from reflections) or overly bright.  I was surprised at how reasonable the acoustics were.  
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/16290603_13313310_14294689.jpg" />
<br /><br />I came home with a nearly full wine taster bottle.   It will be good for drinking and cooking for a few days.   Time to make risotto!
<br /><br />The dance floor was packed.  We did a lot of uptempo big band and 50's rock tunes such as &quot;Jump, Jive and Wail&quot;,  &quot;Kansas City&quot;, &quot;Bandstand Boogie&quot;, and &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;.  I had a bass solo towards the end of the night....&quot;Woodshoppers Ball&quot;.  It was first time I soloed with this group.  So the trust is starting to build in. 
<br /><br />I've uploaded some more photos to &quot;My Photos&quot;.  Check them out if you get a chance.

<br /><br />In other news, several of my students were interviewed recently for Carol Moxley's blog, &quot;She Lives.&quot;  They were asked questions about their experiences in music.  The questions were focused on performing, practicing and what their motivators are.  The interviews were posted last Friday and you can view them at:

The proceeds will go to the Fredericksburg chapter of Guitars Not Guns.  All three bands will donate the night's pay to Guitars Not Guns.  Guitars Not Guns provides guitar lessons and instruments to at risk kids.  We will also have collection bins at the concert for non-perishable food donations. Those donations will go to the Fredericksburg Food Bank. 
<br /><br />The bands performing in this show are The Red Light Effect (alternative/experimental), No Sign of Mourning (hard rock/classic rock/jam band), and Anything Ceol (acoustic/Celtic rock).  More information about the event will become available on my Myspace site and on my website shortly.  In the meantime, check out The Red Light Effect on Myspace at:

<br /><br />Last weekend was great. The Slammin' Sisters gig on Friday went very well…the whole band is getting better and better each time out.  This was the tightest, funkiest show yet.  I had some folks come out that I hadn't seen in years. By the end of the show, everyone was up and dancing.  I really want to get this group out of Fredericksburg and around the area.  There is a lot for us to share.
<br />I'm happy to report that concert on Saturday was also a success. This show really set a new standard for the Kids Jamming For Kids program. All of the bands did very well.  The concert raised $764 for Guitars Not Guns, enough to help out 15 children. We also had 109 pounds of food donations for the Fredericksburg Food Bank, bringing the yearly total to 349 pounds.
<br /><br />Anything Ceol played first, just as the sun was setting. (Ceol is Celtic for music.) It had already been a beautiful clear day, but the sunset was lovely.  They did a great set that ranged from '39 and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, to the Celtic song House Carpenter, to the bluegrass tune Jerusalem Ridge.  Their set was very well received.  This was a concern of mine since certain people have a mindset to yell &quot;Freebird!&quot;
<br /><br />No Sign of Mourning went next. This was the youngest of the bands, but they tackled some very difficult tunes. They made quite the impression as a result. The set list included Dream On, Under the Bridge, Purple Haze, All Along the Watchtower (Hendrix's version) and Emily. Sarah managed to work out a cool little drum feature, which had improved 1000% over the course of a week.  She and I did a cool bass and drum funk jam. That was a treat. 
<br /><br />My throat tore up partway through the first set, unfortunately, so singing was a difficult affair at times...especially considering we were doing songs like &quot;Dream On&quot;. The audience didn't throw anything, so I guess it didn't sound so bad in the end. I needed to drink a lot more water than I did, and to talk a lot less (nearly impossible given the circumstances).
<br /><br />The Red Light Effect put on a stellar show. They just keep getting better each time I see them. I think they came out of that show with many, many new fans of all ages.
<br /><br />Many &quot;thank yous&quot; are in order.  Thanks to Matt Jones for running stellar sound on a crippled sound board, and for towing the U-Haul trailer. And for inviting me to just hang out at Kings Dominion on Sunday. I needed that day off. And a few amusement park rides to get my right brain turned back on. And then another 10 –12 hours of sleep. And that's exactly what happened. Thank you.
<br />Kira also ran sound for the first time during the show, and she did a really good job with it. She also hung out with me during our 2 hour U-Haul debacle. She kept my spirits up as we tried to get a trailer with working lights (or a truck with a working wiring harness). We are still not entirely sure who is at fault with that one. A trip to the garage is in order for my truck, to see if there is fault with my wiring harness. (We hooked up Matt's Chevy Tahoe and one of the trailers was still having lighting problems.)
<br /><br />Thanks to Stephanie for the photos she took…they look great! Thanks to Dylan Vasey for being the zen stagehand that he becomes when everything gets chaotic. He did a great job micing all the gear and working very indepedantly with a minimum of &quot;Miss Brittany, how do I do this?&quot; questions. But Dylan is also an old pro of these shows now….so he has got things under control.
<br /><br />Thank you to Howard. He showed up with Matt because he was bored. He was put straight to work on sound and AV tasks. Thanks for the assist. I think we may just see you again!
<br /><br />Thanks to EVERYONE who helped load the gear at my house (despite the U-Haul debacle) and returned at 1 AM to unload it and carry up to my apartment. WOW. Thanks SO much. Seriously.
<br />Thanks to Kathy Fullen for providing two rescue squad ambulances on site. I suspect you had an ulterior motive (like watching your daughter play), but you guys still rock! Thanks for bringing the gear to take care of folks if they needed it. 
<br /><br />I loved the look on one student's face when the ambulances started rolling in.  She looked at me and queried, &quot;How'd you do that?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I know people.&quot;  This is true.  I know Katie's mom after all.  I might even know a few more folks beyond that.
<br /><br />&quot;Wow, I knew you were famous.&quot; 
<br /><br />My mind mentally replies....&quot;Say what?&quot;, but my outside voice doesn't kick in, thankfully. 
<br /><br />I love this young lady, but she is obsessed with rock stardom.  I've tried to explain to her the concept of a &quot;working musician&quot;, but it somehow doesn't click with her.  So she decided long ago that it was only a matter of time before her teacher was going to be a rock star.  At some point after that, she might just be one too.  Or at the very least, it would be cool to say her teacher was a rock star.
<br /><br />Now I was pondering the fact that the rescue squad had offered a fire truck as well.  Katie and I both declined the fire truck prior to the event.  After all, that might  be overkill.  And someone might actually need it, making response time much slower.  Yes, it would be very cool, but probably overkill.  Now I was thinking....if I had said yes, this girl would be losing her mind right now.  So maybe next year.  Why not?  Fire truck tours are way cool.  And maybe I could find someone who flies a LifeFlight helicopter who would let the kids tour it.  Land that thing right in the middle of the field...now that  would really be amazing.  Okay, back to reality....
<br /><br />Four Winds was very pleased, and they are already talking about next year's show, kids permitting. You never know when a band is going to break up or disband, and kids often graduate or just move on. 
<br /><br />Thanks to Guitars Not Guns for coming out and setting up your booth, and for providing a guitar to be raffled off. The winner of the Epiphone AJ-100 acoustic was Greg Barnes.  He left the show prior to the drawing, saying &quot;I've always wanted to learn guitar.&quot; A few minutes later, he owned one. Thanks for the great T-shirts GNG provided all of the bands.
<br /><br />Thanks to all the parents who provided taxi service for their kids. There was at least band per day, in my apartment, doing daily practice for two weeks. It was almost to the point that cots would be needed.
<br /><br />Thanks to Jen Hendrickson for creating the posters for the event. They looked really great, and turned all the kids into instant local celebs. I even saw Sarah signing an autograph for a fellow drummer after she played.
<br />Thanks to the FLS for the great article you ran on the event.  It is still online at:
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffredericksburg.com%2FNews%2FFLS%2F2008%2F082008%2F08212008%2F404197"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2008/082008/08212008/404197</a>
<br /><br />And thanks to our MC Lex (Luthor) Knight…nice job! Lex apparently is a bassist as well.
<br /><br />Random vingettes about the show. Or rather the post-show. Dylan and I got to glimpse some kind of interesting flying craft that appeared somewhere over old town Fredericksburg that night. Seriously. Weird flying stuff. I'm not saying it was aliens. I'm saying it's unidentified, and rather interesting. It flew like a plane crashing, but it wasn't crashing. It was &quot;crashing&quot; at a straight line above the treetops. You had to be there. Thankfully, Dylan was, so he'll back me up on that one.
<br />So we got all the gear back into my apartment, and I dropped Dylan off. Katie and Sarah were so wound up that we all ended up at IHOP until 3 AM or so. It was the first time since 4:00 PM that I got a meal.   So we ate, and hung out watching the noisy drunks frolic at IHOP.  At least the girls learned how not  to act in public. 
<br /><br />Speaking of personality, this show was rampant with a lot of great personalities, making the show exceptional.  I usually get two types of kids.  Type one is &quot;The Rockstar&quot;.  I am weeding those types out.  These kids show up, expect everyone else to do all the work, usually exhibit a poor attitude if something goes wrong, and then go home when their band is done playing.  They whine.  They make life miserable for everyone else.  If a backstage drama explodes, you know exactly who is in the middle of it.  &quot;Rockstars&quot; don't get it.  Those kids get one strike, maybe two, and then they are banned from KJFK until some sign of maturity hits.  They aren't told they are banned, their phone just doesn't ring anymore with gig phone calls from me, just like in the real world. 
<br /><br />Type two is &quot;WMT&quot; or &quot;the Working Musician in Training&quot;.  Here is the WMT: no attitudes, always eager to help, always eager to learn about everything, and they will stay until the last piece of gear is put away (or until they hit curfew).  They also care deeply about the music, their instruments, the show, the audience, their band, their fellow musicians, and about doing a good job.  And there are no backstage dramas.  None.  Ever.  Those folks are invited to play with open arms and are given gigs over and over again. 
<br /><br />The show was rampant with WMTs.  I was impressed with Sarah asking me &quot;What time can I show up to pack the drumset?  I want to know where everything is so I can unpack quickly.&quot;   Or Dylan looking over the stage setup charts, and then jumping in to mic the drumset and set up gear.  The folks who did all the lighting work for the show.  The folks who set up the tent for hte sound men.  And the folks who set up a comfortable backstage area, or the folks who just polished and tuned guitars.  The folks who stayed late and helped me get all the gear stowed away.  Those people impress me, and encourage me to keep giving what I have to give.
<br /><br />So, as a result of this show, KJFK has been offered two more shows.  No Sign Of Mourning will be performing at Rev Your Engines on Sept. 20th, 2008. More details will follow soon.   Rev Your Engines is a benefit to stop the sexual abuse of children, and to help survivors.
<br /><br />Anything Ceol was offered a gig performing at an art opening. This is for Sarah's mom, Stephanie Bingham, who is a sculptor.   We would be playing in downtown Fredericksburg at Third Floor. The gig is 5:30 - 6:30 on Friday, October 3rd, 2008.  The installation will feature art inspired by the ocean and marine life.  I suggested that Stephanie make a donation to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation on behalf of the band.  I'm pretty stoked to see how Stephanie's works are going to turn out. She's got some exciting things happening over at her studio. She has done a beautiful piece with a conch shell that I am in love with. It looks like the conch is spinning itself apart.
<br />Thankfully, no sound system is required for any of these upcoming shows.  This last show was pretty hard on my gear.  My Spector bass is having issues right now...lots of buzzing all over the fingerboard, despite an action that now resembles AT&amp;T's high wire work.  The company has told me to send it back.  Several local techs couldn't successfully diagnose the problem.  Prior to this, I was splitting gig time between the Spector and the LightWave bass.  Now the LightWave is being used for every show, with a borrowed Hohner B2V5, a borrowed Ibanez SR 6 string, and my Rick 4003 as my backups. 
<br /><br />A Shure SM-57 mic split in half during a micing demo.  Split right in two...right in the middle of the body of the mic.  Examination revealed dozens of tiny stress cracks in the body of the mic.  That was a shocker for everyone, as these mics are the workhorse mic.   We compared the broken mic to another intact SM57, and you could tell that the company had switched at some point to a lesser quality metal for the body.  The mic with the lesser quality metal was the one that had split.
<br /><br />The 24 channel Carvin board also began having issues, and it needs to go in for servicing.  Upon powering up, the left channel going to the monitors went out.  It  initially went down on the first 8 channels of the board, but then the problem spread to the rest of the channels by the end of the show.  Matt did a great job working around the board's limitations on the fly.
<br /><br />I am thankful that things broke in the way that they did...many things failed at sound check, giving us a week to find replacement gear or work arounds.  The Spector had been declining to an unplayable state over the course of month, so I was able to get several backup instruments for the LightWave in place.   So despite all the gear issues, it really was a fantastic show.  I'm thankful I have a few months to get the board back in order before the Spring show.   
<br /><br />That's all for now.  Have a great Labor Day weekend everyone!

I wanted to share this encouraging email I received from Carol Moxley, reprinted with her permission:
<br /><br />What an encouraging bit of news, Brittany!  So excited about your Kids Jammin' for Kids project!  And it inspired me to do a one-time thing sort of similar.  You can read about it here:
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshe-lives.typepad.com%2Fshe_lives%2F2008%2F08%2Fa-big-party-is.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://she-lives.typepad.com/she_lives/2008/08/a-big-party-is.html</a>
<br /><br />A little post-concert blurb in this post:
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fshe-lives.typepad.com%2Fshe_lives%2F2008%2F08%2Fsunday-spotli-1.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://she-lives.typepad.com/she_lives/2008/08/sunday-spotli-1.html</a>
<br /><br />The event raised money for the Hemispherectomy Foundation.   It was a good test run to just give me a taste of what it would be like to do this sort of thing on a regular basis.  Aside from set-up/tear-down, it was really quite easy to pull off and went very smoothly.  I'll need to find some help to haul equipment, though.
<br /><br />Anyway, just thought you might like to see what you started!
<br /><br />Take care!
<br /><br />Bass-ically, 
<br /><br />Carol

I start to unpack, all my packing, start to unstack all my stacking...&quot;
<br /><br />That was a line from a song a friend of mine wrote in high school. I had to sing it to him once, many years later, to remind him of the pieces he had lost along the way. Now I sing it to myself. For myself.
<br /><br />I was sitting with an artist friend at a party on Saturday. She has gone through a divorce, and then a horribly abusive relationship after the divorce. She was sitting with me at the party, but she was sculpting in her mind at the same time. I could feel the restlessness to get back to her work. She has no choice, she must. And I remember what that was like.
<br /><br />She and I have a lot in common. I was living with a guy for about 5 years. We didn't marry but we had begun talking about it, and it was well enough that we didn't. He was bipolar, and a recovering alcoholic. Our relationship was dysfunctional due to issues he (and I) had to deal with. I lost so much of myself under his roof. I was yelled at far too often, and he was a pack rat. I never had room to ever completely unpack my things. And I spent most of my life at his house feeling stifled, fighting the clutter, and trying to make some kind of comfortable space I could exist in.
<br /><br />I entered that relationship a prolific songwriter, so much so that he invested heavily in my career. I was &quot;our retirement&quot;. I ended up letting him have too much control, and I had some unpleasant experiences in music with him as my &quot;handler&quot;. The pressure, the physical and emotional toll of caring for his house, and the lack of healthy living space killed what used to come naturally...the need to write music. I also started gigging in cover bands locally to make ends meet, and the emphasis shifted to learning dozens of cover tunes for various events. With all of those forces at work, that creative force just stopped, like a light bulb burning out.
<br /><br />And then I left my ex for my best friend, a musician. He ended up being angry, fearful, emotionally abusive, and self-centered (to the point where others around him were just tools). He held extremely negative opinions on women. After I ripped my former life apart and found myself homeless for eight or nine months, he said that that he did it &quot;for his ego.&quot; This same former friend once said (of his house) &quot;This is your home too.&quot; Worse yet, he never fully closed the door, and things would continue to drag things on for years, running hot or cold. In the worst times, he hardly spoke to me, acknowledged me, or even looked at me, even in mixed company.
<br /><br />I put my life back together, overcoming PTSD, getting an apartment, and eventually getting all of my things back from my ex. I still crashed headlong into a depression that nearly killed me. I also met someone amazing who saved me and helped me put myself back together. He coaxed me back to health....&quot;You are an amazing musician and person. The world needs you...you don't get to go yet.&quot;
<br /><br />And so, I chose. I chose stay. It hurt. I don't regret the process. It was a hell of a learning experience. And my companion through all of it asked me of only one thing after I healed...&quot;Pass on the gift I gave you.&quot; I try to everyday. I am mentioning this now because I know kids younger than me who are struggling in the same fight I fought. If you are reading this, STAY. You won't regret it.
<br /><br />But, let's return to my artist friend. Unlike my artist friend, I never recovered the part of me that could write music. Writing music because I had to...because it was me. I've recovered chunks of my creative thinking, but never recovered my connection with the source.
<br /><br />So since the party last Saturday, I've been facing the fact that this is the last part of me I have to recover. My connection, my joy...my ability to dive in and create something from pieces of me and pieces of the connection we all share.
<br /><br />I'm carving out space in my studio to work....not lesson space, not office space. Creative space. I've been up late re-arranging the furniture, unstacking all my stacking, tweaking the monitors I do have, researching analog summing mixers, and looking for my RTA so I can tune the space I am in. I am looking at some reasonable equipment upgrades so my mixes don't make me wince. I can't afford $70 an hour to record, plus duplication costs. I'd love to. I can't. I just don't have it. But as they say (and it so cliche, but true)...&quot;don't die with your music inside of you.&quot; I am tired of waiting. So I am going to work with what I have. I have to get the dust of my recording skills, and improve them.
<br /><br />The process is causing a different type of hope and excitement to stir in my creative spirit. Like a child who was hiding, being coaxed out into the sun. There's no one's ego to satisfy. No agendas. Just me, a bass, my vocals, and the idea that this should be joyful, not painful. So if I play guitar too in the compositions, so be it. Or anything else for that matter.
<br /><br />The ideas are starting to bubble up from the ether...I am happy for the moments as they come.
<br /><br />I'll let you know what I find. The part that harbors self doubt says perhaps this seems so basic and natural for some who are reading my blog. But this is where I am. The part of me that is coaxing the child out of the closet knows that you wish me luck.

The Myspace blog has been a good place to experiment with blogging, but I have had difficulty linking it to other sites like Reverbnation, PAN, and Facebook.  So I have spent a lot of time cutting and pasting.  LiveJournal plays well with others, saving me a bit of work.
<br /><br />The new blog is located here:

<br /><br />Check it out when you get a chance.  I will still post here on PAN for quite awhile, but I might switch exclusively over to the LiveJournal site at some point.
