Because of the efforts of the government to encourage the use of solar power through rebates and incentives there's been an exponential surge in the number of its citizens &amp; businesses making the switch to renewable energy. Statistics implies that Australia is one of the countries which have less carbon emission, though we're a progressive nation with a lot of manufacturing &amp; industry.<br /><br />Australia was blessed in virtually every way to triumph within the search for renewable and clean energy. The nation's geographical position andweather conditions made it highly favourable for solar panels whether it is for home or commercial applications. Sunlight hours are long, wet season and cloudy days are more unlikely throughout the year, and solar power system owners can maximize their energy production whole year round. Another physical characteristic that the country has is that the average home space of 200 square meters per home makesdecentralisation of energy production viable.<br /><br />Aside from physical capacities the united states also caters to another very important aspect in making any project a success, you guessed it right, funding! The country has one of the most comprehensive solar rebates and incentives schemes in the world, and though there is news that the solar multiplier will go down from 5 to 4 and can decrease more over the years, the scheme is still favorable and solar is making an excellent economic investment. The feed in tariff scheme in position also makes a very good deal for its citizens to create the switch to solar power.<br /><br />There are exciting times ahead in the next 5 years, as Australia is catching up to the world leaders within the large scale production of clean energy through massive solar energy parks, and the looming Carbon Tax provides strong incentive for industry to reduce their carbon emissions?-.. Every day property owners also have the opportunity to reduce and sometimes even eliminate their electric bills and reduce their carbon footprints as well, which is the primary global concern.
