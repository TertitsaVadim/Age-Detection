<br />So, you want to buy a conservatory, but you’re on a budget. You don’t want to settle for poorer quality: after all, if you’re going to do that, why bother buying a conservatory at all? Where you can save money is by erecting the conservatory yourself. From “Changing Rooms” and “Home Improvement” all the way through to the more grandiose plans of “Grand Designs”, there’s been something of a DIY revolution over the past 20 years. We’re all busy putting up shelves and curtain poles, so why should a conservatory bother you?
<br /><br />The great thing is, just because you're building the conservatory yourself, you don't have to make do with a small number of specialist kits. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25zZXJ2YXRvcnlxdW90ZW9ubGluZS5jb20_" target="_blank">DIY Conservatories</a> come in all shapes and sizes, and most popular designs are available for home construction. These include the lean to designs popular for use with bungalows, as well as more traditional Victorian and Edwardian designs. Many companies also offer the ability for you to design DIY conservatories to your own specifications. Maybe you like the size and space afforded by a B shape design, but want something of the unusual shape of a gull wing.
<br /><br />You can combine the two to produce your dream conservatory. You can adapt your design so you have a conservatory that maximises your available space. If you have a paved veranda or patio, then you are already one step ahead. Many suppliers offer <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25zZXJ2YXRvcnlxdW90ZW9ubGluZS5jb20vRElZX0NvbnNlcnZhdG9yaWVzLmFzcA__" target="_blank">DIY Conservatories</a> which are designed to be built up around pre-existing patios or verandas. It also removes one of the trickiest parts of conservatory construction; digging the foundations and pouring concrete.
<br /><br />A note of caution. You might be the world’s most confident DIY enthusiast, but before you go charging into the conservatory construction business, take a step back and ask yourself objectively, “Have I got the necessary experience?” We’ve joked about it, but it’s important to remember that building a conservatory is a construction job like any other and shouldn’t be taken on lightly. Even if you have plenty of experience in similar minor construction jobs (e.g. erecting a garden shed, porch or treehouse), sit down and run through everything that you might need to know for the job. Do you know how to dig foundations?
<br /><br />If you’re planning to add certain amenities, do you have the necessary experience and qualifications? Have you ever plumbed in a water supply before? Are you familiar with wiring? Remember, it is illegal for unqualified personnel to go messing about with gas supplies. If you do have the experience and are confident in yourself, then that’s great. Enjoy yourself. If, however, you realise your skills are lacking, then there is no shame in getting a professional in. You can always order your dream DIY conservatory and then have a builder you are familiar with build it.
<br /><br />That way, you will still make a saving on the astronomical costs of getting one company to supply and build it. If you have experience in certain areas but not others, you can always get help for those specific parts. You might have all the necessary experience to erect DIY conservatories and fit blinds, flooring, etc, but get a spark in to do the electrics. Make sure when you buy a DIY conservatory that your supplier is willing and able to answer any questions you may have during construction or further down the line.
<br /><br />Even the most confident of DIY enthusiasts will need a couple of friends along to help with certain stages of the build. You can’t lift and fit an entire conservatory on your own. Once it’s up, you can sit back and enjoy your custom-designed conservatory. And how much better will it feel knowing you built it with your own bare hands (or, at least, slightly fuller pocket)?

<br />It’s a common question when you set out on a trip; do I need to take a travel first aid kit? OK, maybe not if you’re off to gay Paris for the weekend, but in areas where medical facilities aren't on the same level as in the UK it’s a sensible question. It’s always sensible to have first aid equipment when travelling, but if visits are planned to remote areas, where medical facilities may be inadequate, you should take a sterile <a href="/" target="_blank">travel first aid kit</a> containing needles and syringes.
<br /><br />In many less developed countries, viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C are rife and can be transferred in the blood. Some of these countries do not have the same standards as in the UK and equipment used may not be adequately sterilised, blood used for transfusions may not be screened for HIV, Hepatitis B and C. You quickly realise how, even if you are careful, a sterile travel first aid kit can quickly mean the difference between life and death.
<br /><br />Minor injuries:
<br /><br />You should be carrying adequate supplies so you can self-treat common traveller ailments, such as cuts, grazes and burns. In hot climates where there may be dust or poor hygiene you are more susceptible to infection. Wounds should be cleaned immediately, covered and if any signs of infection develop you should seek urgent medical help.
<br /><br />Insurance:
<br /><br />Things can go wrong when travelling, accidents can occur or you could get sick or injured on your trip. You might get hit by a dangerous driver, slip off a kerb and twist your ankle, or just catch a good old fashioned stomach bug. Ensure you have comprehensive travel insurance that will adequately cover you in the event that you get sick or injured. Don't miss out any pre-existing medical conditions, because even minor conditions can invalidate your claim if they were not disclosed beforehand.
<br /><br />Make sure your insurance covers you for all the activities you wish to experience on your travels and includes cover for medical evacuation, personal injury and terrorist activity. A frightening statistic is that only 60% of insurance policies cover terrorism, so make sure you read the small print and have adequate cover.
<br /><br />What should my <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b3JsZHdpZGVuZXRzLmNvLnVrL2ZpcnN0LWFpZC0xMS1jLmFzcA__" target="_blank">travel first aid kit</a> contain?
<br /><br />Contents of a travel first aid kit will vary for each traveller’s needs. There are a few key areas you should consider:<span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"></span>
<br />Emergency Medications: antibiotics for wounds that have become infected, pain killers, prescribed medications - keep these in their original packaging.
<br /><br />Diarrhoea Treatment: oral rehydration salts, especially for children. Antidiarrhoeal tablets can be purchased from your local pharmacy or travel clinic. Alcohol hand gel can be useful for when there are no hand washing facilities available.
<br /><br />Injuries: swabs and dressings.
<br /><br />Lotions: you can purchase treatments for eye infections from your local pharmacy. It might also be useful to have an antibiotic ointment to treat skin infections (such as fucidin) and a cream to apply to burns. An antihistamine cream is useful for treating rashes and insect bites.
<br /><br />Equipment: tweezers, safety pins, sterile gloves, a digital thermometer, tick removers, scissors.
<br /><br />Mosquitoes: mosquito nets, insect repellents .
<br /><br />Sterile Equipment: sterile needles and syringes, intravenous cannula for a drip, suture material for sewing up skin. These should be in a specially designed kit. Do not carry single needles and syringes as customs may suspect they are for drug use. Purchase a specially prepared sterile first aid kit that includes a declaration that the contents are for personal medical use in an emergency.
<br /><br />Documentation: first aid book, details of blood group and regular medication, copies of prescriptions if carrying prescribed medication.

<br /><br />Wearing stones of particular significance is a tradition dating back 2000 years or more. They were once thought to have magical powers and to bring good luck to the wearer. Today, they make wonderful gifts for 18th or 21st birthdays. Since at least the 1600s, particular stones have been thought to have links to particular months. Though which stone goes with which month has varied somewhat over the centuries, according to modern tradition they are: 
<br /><br />January - Garnet
<br /><br />February - Amethyst
<br /><br />March -Aquamarine
<br /><br />April - Crystal Quartz
<br /><br />May - Emerald/Chrysoprase
<br /><br />June - Pearl/Moonstone
<br /><br />July - Ruby
<br /><br />August - Peridot
<br /><br />September - Sapphire
<br /><br />October - Pink Opal/Tourmaline
<br /><br />November - Citrine
<br /><br />December - Turquoise/Blue Topaz
<br /><br />When it comes to so significant a date as an 18th or 21st birthday, something so linked to one’s origins is a great way to mark and remember the occasion. One of the earliest references to wearing precious stones for luck is to be found in the Old Testament. The Book of Exodus the breastplate worn by the prophet Aaron is described thus,&quot;It was square... and folded double. Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl; in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and an emerald; in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst; in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper.
<br /><br />They were mounted in gold filigree settings. There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes&quot; From there, different precious stones became associated with different signs of the zodiac and, over time, this became a belief that certain precious stones were linked to certain months of the year. We have the Poles to thank for the specific tradition of wearing stones associated with months of the year. At that time it was believed that certain stones held magical powers and each birthstone’s power would become greater during their particular month.
<br /><br />For that reason, people of the time would rotate the birthstone they wore in line with the months. Some people still follow this tradition and so invest in a full set of the twelve birthstones. Nobody wants to give mass-produced jewellery as 21st gifts. One wants to give something precious and personal. Buying birthstone jewellery as 18th or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaXJ0aHN0b25lZ2lmdHMuY28udWsv" target="_blank">21st gifts</a> allows one to create something that is truly personalised. All of the fittings are made in solid Sterling silver or 9 carat gold. To add that extra personal touch, one can choose to have the wearer’s name or initials incorporated into the chain or added as one of a wide selection of charms. Birthstones are available fitted as ever popular rings, bracelets, pendants or larger (but still delicate) necklaces.
<br /><br />All of these choices are available in a range of styles and designs to suit any taste. From charm bracelets laced with a variety of luck-bringing symbols to Sterling silver rings handmade by big name designers. Of course, precious stones can be expensive, but one can still give an impressive looking gift without spending a small fortune. Birthstones can also be made by colouring Swarovski crystal. Ensure you are dealing with a reputable supplier. Some imitation birthstones can look correct, but are only made of glass and plastic. When marking an 18th or 21st birthday, one doesn’t want to be handing over what is essentially children’s play jewellery!
<br /><br />Reputable jewellers will ensure that even their synthetic stones are of the highest quality. Once you’ve invested in that perfect 18th or 21st birthday gift, you want to make sure it lives up to all your expectations. Make sure to ask about the jeweller’s aftercare package. The best should offer a cleaning service so the lucky bearer can keep their piece looking bright without damaging it. It doesn't matter if you believe in their luck-giving properties or not; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaXJ0aHN0b25lZ2lmdHMuY28udWsv" target="_blank">birthstone gifts</a> jewellery makes a great gift for an 18th or 21st birthday. The association of a particular stone with a particular month has a particular significance.

<br /><br />Cables are definitely the backbones of several systems, whether it's a person's LCD, television set, pc, CCTV, video, stereo system as well as your camcorder. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXh4aWEuY28udWsv" target="_blank">Audio and video cables</a> are needed everywhere and then for all form of connectivity. You could purchase pricey systems and sets however until you have appropriate cables in place, your systems may not work. It is important to have good cable connections for stable systems and also long lasting results. Defective cables would probably bring about variations as well as poor performance, finally leading to system failure. 
<br /><br />The electronics marketplace can be confusing to those who don't know much about the various solutions that are available to the modern consumer searching for audio and video cables. Too often, consumers unfamiliar with the market end up buying the most expensive products because they assume high price means high quality. With all audio and video cables, one thing to look out for during buying is the compatibility factor. One needs to make sure that your system is compatible with the cable you are buying.
<br /><br />If you are only looking to listen to background music, or to watch new shows, etc., you can use the cheap audio and video cables that come in the package with the other components. But you can only do this if you are not too concerned about the sound or picture quality and what other components you are hooking up to the cables. Several types and many brands of audio and video cables can be found. If you find yourself utilizing the appropriate cables for your equipment, it is possible to see a massive development in the quality of the sound as well as the picture.
<br /><br />People who are more keenly interested in higher sound quality or better picture quality have more options. Audio and video cable specialists have got goods intended for improved quality and durability. Some of these cables can cost as much as five hundred dollars or more. While many individuals have difficulty telling the difference between sound as well as picture coming through the priciest audio and video cables and through the ordinary cables, you have the elite who seem to think that absolutely no expense is too high in regards to owning the very best audio and video cables for the ultimate entertainment experience.
<br /><br />The basic purpose of audio and video cables is to transfer the signal from point A to point B unadulterated. Regarding audio cables particularly, at audio frequencies the goal is usually to reduce losses by controlling the amount of Resistance, Inductance and Capacitance. There are four basic kinds of audio cables that one can use which are analog audio leads, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXh4aWEuY28udWsv" target="_blank">audio video leads</a>, audio speaker leads and digital leads.
<br /><br />A video cable would connect your video player or DVD player to the LCD or normal television. Initially you might find video cables to be a bit cumbersome to control and especially to set up. However if you have read the instructions thoroughly, then there's nothing much to be concerned about. The handbook will usually aid you in guaranteeing you will have the right audio and video cables.
<br /><br />Audio and video cables tend to be made from fire proof materials so that they do not get burnt down easily in the case of any short circuits. They normally are easy to install as well as safe. Also, these are easily available over online shopping websites and can be ordered right at your doorstep. But make sure you go for a one which offers a guarantee period also. Also, there are many cables that come with voltage stabilizers. This shields your devices from getting broken from low or high voltage.

<br /><br />Back pain affects around 80% of us at sometime in our lives. Figures from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) report that around 30% of all injuries to employees are caused when handling, lifting and carrying. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5paGFzY28uY28udWs_" target="_blank">Manual handling training</a> is not just important for people who do regular heavy lifting, but for anyone who does ANY sort of lifting and carrying - that’s almost everyone. All “manual handling” needs to be done properly. An awkward sideways or sudden movement, regular or repetitive tasks - they could all cause back strain. Your back is a wonderful piece of technology, but also a vulnerable one and it needs to be taken good care of.
<br /><br />Learning good manual handling technique is not difficult, it’s a matter of thinking about any <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5paGFzY28uY28udWsvdHJhaW5pbmctcHJvZ3JhbW1lL21hbnVhbC1oYW5kbGluZy1pbi10aGUtd29ya3BsYWNl" target="_blank">lifting or carrying</a> task and ensuring that any difficulties have been taken into consideration BEFORE starting it. Always test the weight, always consider the route: are there stairs, doors to be opened, is the lighting sufficient, is there somewhere to put it down? These are all examples; there are many more factors that should be considered.
<br /><br />Five years ago, the HSE launched &quot;Better Backs&quot;; a major initiative which they hoped would encourage more people to undertake manual handling training and thus reduce the number of back injuries sustained at work. While the number of such injuries has been reduced, poor manual handling remains a serious problem.
<br /><br />Those working in certain industries are particularly at risk. Recycling, land transport, sewage and refuse disposal, and furniture, food and beverage production account for the largest number of such injuries. The HSE statistics also break down the manual handling injuries into types, for example over the last five years 25% of injuries were caused when lifting or putting down loads, 16% when pushing or pulling loads and 11% were sprains and strains from body movement.
<br /><br />Good manual handling training should include good explanations of ALL factors which need to be taken into consideration when preparing for a lift and should clearly show how to lift properly. Explaining how the back works gives great background and clarifies what exactly is happening when the back is mistreated and makes SENSE of the training. Good training needs to hold the interest, using various forms such as video, animation, illustration and clear, well-spoken language. Regular interactivity ensures knowledge is more likely to be retained.
<br /><br />A toddler picking up a box from the floor will almost invariably use naturally good manual handling technique - bending at the knees rather than from the back - perhaps because their centre of gravity is low, but for whatever reason we lose this knowledge as we grow older and have to relearn it. We can all avoid future back pain by taking a little time now.

<br />If you are planning a tour of Italy then you must, of course, consider Rome. Not for nothing is it known as “the Eternal City”. It has, in its time, been the centre of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic, the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZWxsYXJvbWUuY29tL2Rlc3RpbmF0aW9ucy9sYXppby9yb21lLmFzcA__" target="_blank">Kingdom of Italy</a> and (since 1946) the Italian Republic. Many of the remnants of these great civilisations can still be seen in the city’s historic centre, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
<br /><br />The Colosseum is one of the world’s most visited tourist destinations, attracting 4 million visitors each year. Those tourists will be treated to one of the greatest works of Roman architecture and engineering. The Colosseum is itself almost 2000 years old. It was originally constructed on the outskirts of the city, but since then Rome has grown and enveloped it, so it is now seen by many as the city's unofficial heart.
<br /><br />For those who prefer to live in the present, Rome can also offer those taking a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZWxsYXJvbWUuY29tLw__" target="_blank">tour of Italy</a> the country’s very best nightlife. There is a plethora of nightclubs and bars to appeal to all tastes. Well known hotspots include Akab Cave in Testaccio. With a dance floor in a cave (hence the name) and a Japanese style garden out back, it offers the tourist a style that goes beyond the simply gimmicky. A touch of high class is brought by Brancaleone out in the suburb of Montesacro. Those making the trip will not be disappointed as, as well as a dance floor, Brancaleone also boasts an exhibition gallery, library and outdoor space. Classy. The Rock Castle Café is a popular venue with both locals and tourists.
<br /><br />Located, as the name suggests, in the dungeons of the Palazzo Cenci, you can enjoy a cocktail and a dance in a uniquely medieval setting. Roman venues do not typically have a set house style of music: instead, the style of music rotates on a semi-regular basis depending on which DJ or band is playing on any particular night. If you have a particular fondness for New Wave, electro, dance or house, best to make sure which clubs are playing it that night before you set out.
<br /><br />Italy is known for its fashion and Rome, along with Milan, is one of the two chicest cities on the globe. Some of Italy’s oldest jewellery and clothing lines were founded in Rome and the modern tourist can still find parades of boutique fashion houses selling the very coolest in designer ware.
<br /><br />The sports fan will also find much to attract them in Rome. The city has hosted a number of major sporting events across its history. It was the site of the 1960 Summer Olympic Games, utilising a number of the city’s ancient sites as event venues (e.g. the gymnastics were held at the Roman Baths of Caracalla). Rome has hosted the Football World Cup twice - once in 1934 and again in 1990 - the latter famously introducing high art to a traditionally populist sport with a performance by the Three Tenors the night before the final. Rome’s long tradition of attracting sports fans looks set to continue as the city is currently bidding to host the 2020 Summer Olympics Games.
<br /><br />Whether you plan to spend an entire holiday in the city or want to make it just one stop on your wider tour of Italy, you can’t go wrong with Rome. Once the centre of the world’s mightiest civilisation, the Eternal City still shines with arts, history and culture.

<br />The Royal Savoy Sharm el Sheikh is the “Club” wing of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdXh1cnlob3RlbGhvbGlkYXlzLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Sharm el Sheikh's Savoy Hotel</a>. It offers the high quality service one expects from the &quot;Savoy&quot; name. The facilities and amenities of the Royal Savoy cover every aspect of the guest’s stay, ensuring that nothing will disturb your peace, tranquillity and relaxation.
<br /><br />The Royal Savoy is reserved exclusively for the use of adults. Children under the age of 12 and pets are not allowed in the Club wing. Families are welcome in the rest of the resort - there is even a supervised, soft play arcade where children can play safely - but it’s also important for the adults to have a place where they can be free of the noise and frantic activity that can come with a family resort. Neither are groups allowed; bookings are only accepted from individual guests, so you can rest assured your holiday will not be overshadowed by anybody else’s.
<br /><br />This doesn’t mean guests won’t necessarily want to have their own fun. Guests can take a walk down to the hotel’s private beach. The White Knight Beach is situated on the South Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, facing out across the Red Sea. It is an area noted for its astounding natural beauty. According to Christian, Jewish and Islamic tradition, this was where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, and the southern area of the peninsula is home to Saint Catherine’s Monastery, the oldest working monastery in the world. Some believe that Tiran Island, which can be seen from the resort’s private beach, was the site of Moses’s parting of the Red Sea.
<br /><br />White Knight Beach offers access to a range of wastersports, including para-sailing, water-skiing, canoeing and windsurfing. The Red Sea is a popular destination for divers due to its clear waters, warmth and rich variety of flora and fauna, and guests to the Royal Savoy can go snorkling at a nearby reef or deeper diving at the hotel’s own scuba dive centre.
<br /><br />Those who book a holiday at the Royal Savoy can choose from a selection of accommodation. The main Royal Savoy building contains two spacious suites, each one comprising a salon, bedroom, bathroom and balcony. You will be presented with flowers, drinks and seasonal fresh fruit upon your, and supplied with sweet treats each additional day.
<br /><br />For those looking for a romantic getaway, there are sixteen recently constructed honeymoon suites. Each has a four-poster bed and two-person Jacuzzi. Mood lighting creates a romantic atmosphere. You needn’t be too divorced from home, as international, European and local channels are available on each room’s plasma television set.
<br /><br />Sharm el Sheikh has been dubbed &quot;the world's meeting place&quot;; it lies at the point where three major continents - Europe, Asia and Africa - meet. It makes the perfect, quality venue for meetings, conferences and summits. The hotel’s spacious conference halls - equipped with state of the art audio and visual equipment - are complimented by the Royal Savoy’s luxuriously furnished executive apartments.
<br /><br />The Royal Savoy is the very definition of elegance and tranquillity. Its guests expect the very best and the resort’s dedicated staff work hard to exceed those expectations. Whether you book your Royal <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sdXh1cnlob3RlbGhvbGlkYXlzLmNvbS9lZ3lwdC9zaGFybS1lbC1zaGVpa2gvcm95YWwtc2F2b3k_" target="_blank">Savoy Sharm el Sheikh holiday</a> in order to indulge, rejuvenate or relax, the resort will deliver, quietly and exceptionally.

<br />A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXltYW5leHBlcnRzLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvQ29sbGlzaW9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">road traffic accident investigator</a> can find his job throws him into all kinds of situations and take him to all sorts of locations.
<br /><br />The majority of their work comes from LSC funded instructions although they are seeing a growth in the number of instructions funded by insurance companies. One such case which I came across recently involved a lorry driver from France who was charged with causing death by careless driving. Clearly, this was to be funded by the driver’s insurance company and they were looking for a dual skilled Collision Investigator and Vehicle Examiner to assess all the factors involved. 
<br /><br />In order to get the investigation underway the expert decided to take the following course by investigating: time taken for the pedestrian (a pensioner) to reach the point of impact, the conspicuity of the pedestrian, given that a slower moving object in the peripheral vision is much less obvious, time taken to slow the vehicle at its weight at the time of collision from various speeds, the sight lines from the vehicle across the cab given the driver’s weight (this kind of vehicle has an adjustable, air ride seat which sinks when the driver’s weight is applied), any other vehicle defect which might have caused it to perform below its normal standard, whether the driver was within his tacograph limits, as fatigue is instrumental in the erosion of awareness, and a thorough review of the Police <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXltYW5leHBlcnRzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Collision Investigator’s</a> report to establish whether they had considered all the factors.
<br /><br />In this case the investigator actually had to travel to the place where the vehicle was located, which in this case was France. 
<br /><br />His vehicle examination concluded that the sight lines from the driver’s seat opened up exponentially, due to perspective, the further away from point of impact the vehicle was sited. Given that microscope analysis of the tacograph identified a speed of not in excess of 23mph, and that the consultant was able to calculate deceleration rates under braking, he was able to piece together what was in view from the point where the pedestrian stepped from the pavement to her impact with the vehicle. All of this information was then pieced together in the form of a report, plan, photo album and DVD video footage with the intention of attempting to explain the nuances of a highly technical investigation to a jury.
<br /><br />It was concluded that a mistake on the part of the driver had caused the accident in which the woman died. What had caused the driver to be unaware of the presence of the pedestrian only he will know. From the legal point of view, they were able to advise that he was unlikely to be able to construct a reasonable defence and the insurance company were advised accordingly.
<br /><br />This case study reveals several interesting realities of the collision investigation industry.
<br /><br />If nothing else it shows what a varied and complex role it can be. In our day to day lives we do not concern ourselves with the mechanics of how these kind of investigations work behind the scenes, yet upon examination it proves to be a fascinating world.

<br />Orangeries are an attractive and effective way of bringing more light into your house while also providing you with somewhere that is sturdy and warm enough to serve as comfortable living space. Like conservatories, orangeries are sometimes referred to as &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25zZXJ2YXRvcnlxdW90ZW9ubGluZS5jb20vaW5kZXhfMDEuYXNw" target="_blank">sunrooms</a>&quot;, which has led to some people getting confused as to the difference between the two. The difference is subtle, but easy to understand once you know it. Whereas a conservatory has walls made entirely (or at least predominantly) of glass, the walls of an orangery are made of stone or hardwood: although they will still prominently feature large windows and possibly a skylight.
<br /><br />Orangeries date back as far as the sixteenth century. Their original purpose was to provide a warm, but light-filled environment in which merchants could grow fruit and exotic vegetables during the harsh winters of northern Europe. The orangery didn’t truly come into fashion until the seventeenth century, when merchants in countries such as France, Germany and the Netherlands began importing large numbers of exotic plants for their beauty and scent.
<br /><br />The earliest orangeries were wooden shacks, sometimes covered with a tarpaulin, designed purely for practical rather than aesthetic reasons. As time went on, however, orangeries increasingly came to be viewed as a symbol of wealth and opulence. After all, the fruits grown within them were expensive fare and so their cultivation was generally only feasible by those who could afford a sizeable outlay. And, of course, the moment something becomes a fashion symbol is the moment it begins to become ever more extravagant. Soon, vast orangeries were being constructed in the grounds of stately homes across Europe.
<br /><br />Building an effective <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jb25zZXJ2YXRvcnlxdW90ZW9ubGluZS5jb20vSGFyZHdvb2RfQ29uc2VydmF0b3JpZXMuYXNw" target="_blank">orangery</a> was not always an easy task, however. Growing plants inside is a difficult task at the best of times and in the days before reliable central heating or double glazing, many owners found it difficult to balance sufficient levels of heat and light in their orangery. An orangery is the oldest surviving structure at London’s magnificent Kensington Palace. However, even the great architect Sir William Chambers was not infallible and the light levels below the building’s solid roof made the cultivation of plants near impossible.
<br /><br />This rather nice gallery building is today used as a restaurant; emblematic perhaps of the changing role of the orangery in our culture. The solid roof of the Kensington Palace orangery was presumably in an effort to keep the heat in: many early orangeries suffered from poor insulation and in some cases open fires were necessary to provide sufficient levels of warmth. In later years, as technology improved, under floor heating made it easier to keep the plants warm. Opening windows allowed for the regulation of heat; obviously, oranges and the like required plenty of heat to grow, but all that glass could lead to the orangery becoming too hot for more delicate plants in the height of summer.
<br /><br />Nowadays, orangeries are used almost exclusively as sunrooms. They offer a warmth and security which, even in these days of double glazing, some find lacking in conservatories. Their thick walls and open windows offer light and views, while feeling like an integrated part of the house, rather than something that has simply been stuck on the end.

<br />Specialist Temperature Measurement and Control Services have a vast amount of instrumentation and temperature control experience in numerous fields including aerospace, the automotive industry, power generation, water treatment, metal processing and pharmaceuticals and will provide a thorough, professional service. 
<br /><br />They also offer a wide range of sensor products and instrumentation from transmitters, sensors and thyristors to indicators, thermal imagers and kiln controllers and programmers.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taXRzY28uY28udWs_" target="_blank">Kiln controllers</a> are made to fit all manner of kilns with all manner of uses. If you enjoy pottery as a hobby or sideline then you will be after a simpler and more cost effective model. The ST 3300/1 is probably the kiln controller for you. These kiln controllers have a single program, delay and 2 ramps and dwells. The next model up, the ST 3300/2, is suitable for those will a small pottery studio, whose kilns might see more frequent use. These kiln controllers benefit from 10 programs, delay and 4 ramps and dwells. The 10 program, 16 ramp and dwell ST 3300/3 model is ideal for firing, fusing and slumping glass and the ST 3300/4 has all the features of the ST 3300/3 as well as an event function for programmed or manual control of a damper. These kiln controllers are most suited for commercial uses.
<br /><br />For the much larger or industrial oven or kiln, where the load is separated into zones, the ST 3300/5 is the best model. These kiln controllers are similar to the ST 3300/4 models but also benefit from an additional policeman controller which ensures the added protection of your kiln.
<br /><br />These companies can conduct the calibration and servicing of your kiln on site or in the company laboratory and the calibration is carried out on indicators, kiln controllers, recorders and other instruments using electrical simulation. Kilns are obviously rather heavy things to be carting about all over the place, so the company can also arrange to pick up and return your equipment. Pretty good service, I'd have thought.
<br /><br />For larger kilns and larger problems you can take full advantage of the breakdown and repair service where an engineer will come to your workplace and repair the kiln or oven on site. A survey of your furnace is a good pre-emptive strategy, allowing you to catch any minor faults before they become bigger and more costly.
<br /><br />Kilns have a long service life, so you may find the component that's just broken in yours isn't made anymore. Fear not. A good industrial <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taXRzY28uY28udWsvdGhlcm1hbF9pbWFnZXJzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">temperature services</a> company will still be able to find it for you in ex stock or, failing that, will configure or manufacture the item needed themselves to suit your precise requirements.

<br />The birth stone of December is turquoise, an awe-inspiring azure precious stone that's been capturing eyes and hearts for milliennia. Wearing the birthstone linked to your month of birth is believed to generate good luck and protection, and what better way to wear it than in a beautiful turquoise necklace or bracelet, hand made and finished in Sterling silver or 9ct gold.
<br /><br />Turquoise is made of hydrated copper aluminium phosphate and it is found in which are rich in aluminium. Translated literally it means “Turkish”, a nod to its history when Levantine merchants imported the stone to Europe via Turkey. Turquoise is one of the very few opaque precious gems, giving it a distinctive deep-pigmented colour which can vary from green to sky blue depending on its make-up, without or with black veins threaded throughout the stone known as its matrix. Bright blue is considered the most sought-after type of the stone, an on-trend colour in fashion and jewellery. Turquoise and blue topaz are the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaXJ0aHN0b25lZ2lmdHMuY28udWs_" target="_blank">birthstones of December</a>, and Turquoise is also the traditional gem for people celebrating their 6th or 11th wedding anniversaries.
<br /><br />Turquoise was among the first semi-precious stones to be excavated, mainly in the Sinai region of Egypt, Iran, and the United States and Mexico. Having been mined since as long ago as 3,000 BC, understandably the supply of the mineral is running very low. This has triggered replica gemstones becoming prevalent in jewellery in the modern day, and a higher value placed on genuine turquoise.
<br /><br />Turquoise has a history rivalled by no other gem stone. The mummy of Queen Zer, the ancient Eqyptian monarch, was found decorated in four vivid <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iaXJ0aHN0b25lZ2lmdHMuY28udWsvQ2F0ZWdvcnkvVHVycXVvaXNlX0JpcnRoc3RvbmUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">turquoise bracelets</a> when she was unearthed in 1900. She had chosen the precious stone to wear for 7,500 years. And consider the famous gold death mask of Tutankhamen: it too is set with valuable turquoise stones. 
<br /><br />The reason behind its historical prominence is that turquoise has been highly regarded by a great number of ancient societies who believed it held powerful metaphysical attributes. Around Asia the precious stone was believed to shield against the evil eye, and the Aztecs reserved the stone for the Gods in ceremonial masks. In the sixteenth century American Indians thought that turquoise embodied the spirits of the sea and skies, using it as a form of exchange and to bring fortune and protection to soldiers and hunters.
<br /><br />Even today turquoise is perceived as having protective properties. In modern gemstone therapy it is believed to improve confidence and relieve depression, stomach problems, viral infections and rheumatism. If presented as a gift turquoise is regarded as a sign of friendship. Whether you believe in these superstitions or not, it is hard not to see the beauty which this show-stopping stone posesses.

<br />Husband and wife creators Charles and Ray Eames, originally designed this attractive and state-of-the-art piece of lounge set in 1956 as a present for their good close friend and director Billy Wilder (‘some like it hot’, Sunset Blvd’). Ever since it's arrival, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYW1lc2NoYWlyaW5zcGlyZWQuY29tLyMvZWFtZXMtbG91bmdlLWNoYWlyLzQ1NDUzMTQyNjQ_" target="_blank">the Eames lounge chair</a> has evolved into one of the most modern and luxurious pieces of furniture of all time. 
<br /><br />Truth be told there aren’t many who wouldn’t recognise this sleek armchair, as it has made an appearance on screen countless occasions in sitcoms such as, ‘Friends’ - as Joey and Chandlers’ center item armchairs, many times defined within the program as simply being far too relaxing to get up off and one of which is even given a name (‘Rosita’). The Eames lounge chair has also appeared on ‘Frasier’, ‘House’, ITV’s lifestyle TV show ’60 minute makeover’ and films including, ‘Iron Man’ and ‘Mad Men’. 
<br /><br />Co-designer Charles, on one occasion talked about how he wanted the chair to ‘resemble the warmth, familiarity and comfort of a well used baseball mitt’ although his wife Ray, wanted the chair to have a ‘comfortable and un-designy look’. It is easy to see from the chair’s visual appeal that this is exactly what the completed design portrays. Its bucket chair style and raised reverse leaning posture immediately implies exquisite and appears like the baseball glove form, together with the glossy black Italian leather seating and veneer grain finish resembling both the material and colour of a baseball mitt and oozing with coziness.
<br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYW1lc2NoYWlyaW5zcGlyZWQuY29t" target="_blank">Eames inspired lounge chair</a> also arrives complete with mirroring ottoman, which is small enough not to disorder any sort of lounge, dining or workplace area, although big enough for people of any size, to sit back and experience maximum comfort. The chair’s neutral colour variety such as black, brown and white leather and different tones wood grain, allows the furniture piece to blend well with any kind of colour scheme or style. What really make the Eames lounge chair so unique and unusual, is its ability to offer a high level of both style and comfort, as proven in the amount of different screen appearances.
<br /><br />Much like most traditional items of home furniture the Eames lounge chair would be an investment for any customer, through its ability to retain its style and luxurious comfort for years on end. Both chair and ottoman are hand assembled and created with outstanding attention to detail. The lounge chair’s cushions are also individually upholstered and replaceable and the back cushions are also interchangeable, allowing those who aren’t into the ‘leather look’ to change the seating to any material or colour of their choice. Continuing to tick all the boxes, the Eames lounge chair is also eco friendly, as more recently manufactured modules are created with a richly grained veneer known as ‘Santos Palisander’, as opposed to the initial endangered Brazilian Rosewood.
<br /><br />Furthering the Eames collection’s high profile status, the New York Museum of Modern Art have added the lounge chair collection in their permanent collection describing the Eames furniture set as, ‘the most iconic of all modern chair sets’. The set can also be seen on a permanent display at the Art institute of Chicago. It is clear that purchasing the Eames Inspired Collection is like obtaining a piece of history, a talking piece for any house hold or office and most importantly of all, a piece of furniture offering magnificent style and laid back comfort. An absolute must have for all those seeking luxury style, comfort and relaxation!

<br />Previously, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taXRzY28uY28udWsvdGhlcm1hbF9pbWFnZXJz" target="_blank">thermal imaging software</a> may have seemed the stuff of CSI or James Bond; better connected with spotting Russian agents in the Arctic tundra, or tracing the footprints of a fleeing criminal. And many of those associations currently apply.
<br /><br />Police officers normally use thermal imagers to identify the distinctive heat patterns given off by cannabis factories, otherwise hidden within everyday houses or garden sheds. Then again, in the last few years the introduction of low cost, user-friendly technology has seen thermal imaging rolled out across a much wider and perhaps surprising range of industries. As per Mike Berrie's opinion, easy-to-use thermal imaging technology can be advantageous in measuring, tracking and pinpointing trouble spots that have previously been difficult to find, all at a reasonable cost.
<br /><br />The capacity to spot different areas of heat has security uses further than easily catching bad guys. Banks and other institutes can use thermal images to measure where heat is being lost around security doors - an effective indicator of exactly how strongly sealed that area is. Similarly, stores and supermarkets can check the gasket seals on cold storage areas (e. g. freezer and chiller cabinets), ensuring their produce remains fresh and they are not using unnecessarily high levels of electricity to keep it so.
<br /><br />Until recently, organizations would have had to seek the services of specialist contractors to carry out these inspections as the charge of temperature measurement equipment - between $40,000 and $60,000 - rendered ownership of the technology very costly. The advent of cheaper <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taXRzY28uY28udWsvdGhlcm1hbF9pbWFnZXJz" target="_blank">thermal imagers</a>, such as Irisys’s IR16DS, mean not only that these contractors can work more easily, more cheaply and more quickly, but also that non-specialists can purchase their own equipment. The main advantages of cheaper thermal imagers, like Irisys’s IR16DS are they can work more effectively at low costs and very quickly,on top of that that non-specialistscan buy their own equipment.
<br /><br />The actual long run savings are not only obvious, but preventative maintenance is a more practical thing to consider as one does not risk wasting considerable amounts of money only to learn that nothing is wrong. The most interesting thing is that, Thermal imaging can even find uses in your own home. We’re a cost conscious lot these days. With times hard for many we’re always on the lookout for extra ways to save a few pennies - and if it can help us go green at the same time, all the better.
<br /><br />Thermal imaging can reveal to you where your house is dropping the most heat; peer through the viewfinder and identify those houses with poor loft insulation lit up like a Christmas tree. Of course, a blockage in your central heating system can mean large areas of your house not getting any heat at all. Moreover, thermal imagers can tell you the exact place of the blockage and cut down on call out times. On top of that ,they are beneficial in uncovering potentially dangerous electrical faults - always encouraging - and can find areas of excess moisture, assisting you catch damp before it sets in.
<br /><br />Noticing electrical faults is also beneficial in the (literally) high flying world of aerospace engineering. The electrical units of aeroplanes are often strongly packed into narrow cavities in the fuselage and typical servicing can entail the taking apart of large parts in the search for a issue. One top of that, thermal imagers are very efficient in reducing time and expense. There are also another positive aspects like the capacity to spot air leakages quickly and the power to measure the heat generated by moving components.
<br /><br />We can't trust in our own senses to recognize when individual components may be overheating expecially when in an already heated environments just like a ship’s engine room or a busy factory,We can easily manage that with the help of thermal imaging. And that really is only the start. The applications of temperature measurement equipment handle various other industries as diverse as water treatment, research and development, transport, biotechnology, ceramics and even brewing. Not the stuff of science fiction any longer; thermal imagers are hot.

<br />There has never been a better time to go and visit this spectacular country. Kenya is one of the major countries of Africa and an immensely popular tourist location. Kenya is a land of diverse beauty; wide beaches, stunning mountains and open desert. But the large part of the nation is covered by an open, grassy plain, termed savannah. The savannas are the location of a variety of animals, such as lions, giraffes, leopards, antelopes, zebras, elephants, rhinoceros and many others. 
<br /><br />Typically months of July and August are the most popular times during the year to see the country. A person needn't be worried about accommodation in Kenya since there are various luxury houses, camps and also stone cottages. To avoid the wave of tourists vacationing in hotels, and also to have the opportunity to check out the wilderness, why not go and stay at a one of Kenya's many luxury houses?
<br /><br />There is no end to wonders on offer. You can take a trek across the savannah on horse of camel, go rock climbing above the open planes, or take a private truck-top safari. Thus a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbC1sZW50aWxsZS5jb20_" target="_blank">luxury house in Kenya</a> lets anyone to explore their own interests: tall peaks, deep canyons, waving grasslands and sandy beaches cover the land, with each region having its own landscape, climate and wildlife.
<br /><br />You have the chance to head out to check out a few of the world’s most endangered animals, such as black rhinos, 500 of which live in the Laikipia District. For those who stay in a luxury house in Kenya you can expect to almost certainly discover and get in close proximity to game that protected and undisturbed by human contact. You'll almost certainly view elephant, giraffe, leopard, lion, hyena, common zebra, and the rare Grevy's zebra, even more endangered than the black rhino. Luxury houses in Kenya, especially in this district (one of the most favoured tourist destinations in Kenya), allow you to explore the vast plateau bordering the central Kenya highlands and the north west of Mount Kenya. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vbC1sZW50aWxsZS5jb20_" target="_blank">Vacationing in a luxury house</a> in this part of Kenya could be the most memorable experience of a lifetime.
<br /><br />The particular Lewa wildlife conservancy in the Laikipia district additionally promises elephants, leopards, zebras and gazelles. For the more adventurous people, camel safaris will come in handy. Should you be looking for a romantic getaway, taking the family on vacation, or even travelling by yourself, a Laikipia adventure awaits you, and stay in a luxury house in one of Kenya's wildlife ranches. Game Drives, bush breakfasts, escorted walks, night game drives, sundowners, hideouts all feature at houses in Kenya.
<br /><br />The staff of Kenya's luxury accomodation are known for their dedication and welcoming nature. And, as many of Kenya's people speak English there will not be any language barrier. The local people have for ages been extremely helpful, courteous and gladly welcome tourists to their nation. At night you may return to a dusk swim, watching perhaps a herd of elephants arriving at the waterhole, and experience some absolutely memorable cuisine at your luxury house in Kenya. Luxury houses in Kenya are sometimes visited as part of organised safaris, and you'll pay much more if you just turn up and ask for a room. So it’s best to book a luxury house in Kenya in advance to avoid the higher prices. 
<br /><br />With no noticeable effort, vacationing in a luxury house in Kenya will allow you to move in Africa time, entirely controlled by sunrise and nightfall. It will be as if the real world doesn't exist anymore, and you may find yourself viewing the abundant game from much closer than a safari vehicle. Exploring the country sometimes high on a camel, on horseback, or on from the side of a cliff face, Kenya awaits you.
