<br /><br />Do you know the story of Joshua and how the wall of Jericho fell down after the Israelites marched around it once a day for six days, then seven times on the seventh day? Why not just walk around Jericho one time? I think it was because God was testing their faith.
<br /><br />God was teaching them that waiting time is not wasted time. Isaiah 28:16b says, “He that believeth shall not make haste.” God is never in a hurry, like we are. We get upset when we miss a section in a revolving door! God is also never late. He knows what He is doing.
<br /><br />Do you know what our problem is? We’ve been around Jericho six times and we’re ready to quit. Say with the psalmist: “My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from Him” (Psalm 62:5).

<br /><br />People are being sucked into swirling sewers of sin. Homes are coming apart at the seams. Precious little unborn babies are being put to death. Sexually transmitted diseases are rampant.
<br /><br />The time is half past late, and we must return to our “first love.” It’s time to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, and with all our souls, and with all our minds; and love our neighbors as we love ourselves (see Matthew 22:36-39).
<br /><br />It’s time to introduce people to the “free love” offered by our Savior when He died to forgive us our sins and purchase our salvation for eternity.

<br /><br />“Blessed arethe merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.” Matthew 5:7
<br /><br />Those who have received mercy are those who show mercy. And only those who show mercy will be those who continue to receive mercy. Showing others mercy isn’t just sentiment or softness. It is sympathy that serves. Jesus doesn’t merely save us from something, He saves us for something. He wants to express His life through us as we serve others.

Our tracks are different, our lanes are different and our durations are different. The only thing we have in common is the same Judge. For example one person graduates at age 20 and struggles for the next five years to get a job. Another graduates at age 25 and gets a job immediately. One marries a virgin and spends the next decade waiting for the blessings of children. Another, probably after having series of abortions in the past, becomes a mum almost immediately after marriage. One becomes an MD at 30, another becomes MD at 52. Life is full of twists and turns, ups and downs plus many surprises. Life  offers each one of us different opportunities. It is up to each of us to patiently prepare and wait for that opportunity. We learn on the way- No one knows it all or has it better. The devil always tries to tell us that lie over and over but that's just it- A LIE. There is a reason why we all don't fall at the same time. Its so that when one is down, weak and discouraged, the other, who is strong, can encourage and uplift him. God never promised that the road would be easy but HE promised never to leave or forsake us. There's no competition in life so let's learn to go easy on ourselves and trust that God is working it all for good (even if it doesn't make sense at the time). I know that there is a time for everything but most importantly that &quot;it will come to pass&quot;. Whatever trials, challenge or down time, this too shall pass and in due course, you'll be up and strong again to lift up those who maybe down around you&quot; . It is well with us all, Amen! Lots of things in life are by choice and not by force. Let's try to have an amazing life.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” 1 Corinthians 6:9-10
<br /><br />People have the idea today that it is okay to live in immorality and that God is going to overlook their little indiscretions. Is that so?
<br /><br /> “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (Galatians 6:7). God doesn’t miss a beat of our lives. He is the righteous judge and will judge accordingly (see Hebrews 13:4).
<br /><br />“Well Pastor, does that mean that if I have done any of these things, I can’t be saved?”
<br /><br /> No! 1 Corinthians 6:11 promises: “And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.” Hallelujah! There is no sin so awful that the blood of Christ cannot cleanse. He makes the vilest sinner clean.
<br /><br /> Nothing—not your worst offense—stands between you and the Cross. . .between you and forgiveness. . .between you and a loving Heavenly Father—nothing but your hesitation. Come to Him. He longs to receive you.

<br />some complications. He had to be
<br />rushed to the nearest hospital
<br />about 1km away or else it would
<br />be fatal. She called a neighbor
<br />who had a car but the neighbor
<br />said the car had no fuel; she called
<br />the pastor who said he had
<br />visiting pastors from USA and
<br />could not leave them alone. She
<br />decided to carry the son to the
<br />hospital; she could not imagine
<br />loosing her only child to the same
<br />sickness that had killed the
<br />husband few years earlier. She
<br />had a problem with her leg and
<br />could not move fast enough and
<br />the son was also heavy for her to
<br />move faster. Along the way she
<br />met people rushing home from
<br />work who just stared at her. She
<br />tried to beg them for help but
<br />they assumed her. She also tried
<br />to stop passing vehicles but they
<br />never responded. She fell many
<br />times but she had to keep
<br />moving. Then a man who was
<br />mad and used to roam the streets
<br />naked noticed her. He came
<br />running towards her and took the
<br />son from her. She could not talk
<br />but just pointed the direction of
<br />the hospital. The crazy naked man
<br />could understand perfectly well
<br />what she meant since he saw the
<br />desperate boy struggling for
<br />breath. He put him on the
<br />shoulder and told the woman “all
<br />will be well” as he ran towards
<br />the hospital. The doctors on
<br />seeing the crazy man knew
<br />something was really wrong, they
<br />attended to the boy immediately.
<br />Ten minutes later the mother
<br />arrived and the doctor broke the
<br />news “if he was brought five
<br />minutes later, he would have
<br />died” . God doesn’t have to use
<br />Bishops, Pastors, politicians &amp; rich
<br />people with cars to rescue or
<br />bless you. No matter what may
<br />come your way, no matter what
<br />u're going through, your life is in
<br />His hands &amp; He has good thoughts
<br />4 u. I know u will make it. For
<br />there’s a friend in God who will
<br />wipe away your tears. The Word of God
<br />says for with God all things are
<br />possible.

<br /><br />“For He hath made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.” 2 Corinthians 5:21
<br /><br />Have you ever laid your head on the pillow at the end of a long day and satisfyingly said, “Well, I was a good person today, so if I died tonight I will go to heaven”?
<br /><br />If you have, you’re not alone. I would venture to say that most people believe if you go to church, tithe your money, and do good to others, that God is going to let you into heaven.
<br /><br />If being religious could get you to heaven, then why was a religious man like Paul struck down on the Road to Damascus and asked by the Lord, “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?” (Acts 9:4<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br /><br />More importantly, if we could save ourselves with our good deeds, God did not need to send His only Son into the world as a sacrifice for the likes of you and me. No, it is Jesus’ righteousness that saves us. And Him alone.
<br /><br />Take stock: What “religious” things are you doing, hoping to score a few more “brownie points” with God? This is “works doctrine.” Abandon it. Come to Jesus and say, “Nothing in my hands I bring. Simply to Thy cross I cling.”

<br /><br />“And be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.” Philippians 3:9
<br /><br />A woman worked as a maid in the house of a mean innkeeper. One day God saved her and she could not hide her happiness. What used to be drudgery turned into joy. The innkeeper was furious and began to belittle her. He hated her for being happy.
<br /><br />Finally, he said to her, “You say you’re saved and I can see your happiness. Can you tell me what being saved means?”
<br /><br />And she said, “To me, it feels as though I am standing in Jesus’ shoes, and He is standing in mine.” A theologian couldn’t have said it better.
<br /><br />2 Corinthians 5:21 says, “For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.”
<br /><br />Have you come to realize that, in Jesus, you have been made “the righteousness of God”? It is the gift of God, in Him.

<br /><br />In Christ. That is a small phrase, but it is the key that unlocks the door to the largest treasure you will ever know. You see, all that happened to Christ, happened to you.
<br /><br />When He was crucified, you were crucified. When He was buried, you were buried. When He arose, you arose. Christ acted for you. “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption” (1 Corinthians 1:30).

<br /><br />Christian young people have asked me what specific things they can do to practice moral purity. Three of those are:
<br /><br />¨    First, watch the crowd they hang out with. Choose their friends wisely (see Proverbs 13:20).
<br /><br />¨    Second, guard what they put into their minds from books, movies, and music (see Psalm 101:3a, Proverbs 6:27).
<br /><br />¨    Lastly, control their thought life (see Proverbs 23:7a, Philippians 4:8). The thought is the father of the deed. Someone has well said, &quot;We cannot keep the birds from flying over our heads, but we can keep them from making a nest in our hair.&quot;
<br /><br />Walk with God today as you never have before. Guard your heart (Proverbs 4:23, Ephesians 5:3-5). Make a covenant with your eyes (Job 31:1). Set a guard over your lips (Psalm 141:3). Take charge of your thought life: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” (Philippians 4:8)

<br /><br />“Thy way is in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps are not known.” - Psalm 77:19
<br /><br />Visiting the Sea of Galilee is an unforgettable experience. The Lord Jesus walked on the water there, but you cannot see His footsteps. When a boat goes through the ocean, it doesn’t leave a trail does it? When a wagon goes across land, it does leave a trail, but a boat doesn’t.
<br /><br />In this passage in Psalms, what is God saying? That we will never know Him just by studying history—by simply studying what He has done. His ways are mysterious. Isaiah 55:8-9 says, “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.”
<br /><br />But we can know His ways, for He says in Psalm 103:7, “Hemade known His ways unto Moses, His acts unto the children of Israel.” And in Micah 4:2 we find, “And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.”
<br /><br />You can try to make sense of God with all your ingenuity, creativity, and intelligence, but God says we will never know Him that way. We have to lay our intellect in the dust and say to God, “Show me Your ways.”

<br /><br />“And I [Jesus] say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” - Matthew 16:18
<br /><br />There are many people who say, “I believe in Jesus, but I just don’t believe in the church.” That is like saying, “I believe in football, but I just don’t believe in stadiums, the gridiron, goal posts, and shoulder pads.”
<br /><br />Jesus loves the church. He gave His life for the church. If you are ever going to be victorious in the spiritual battles of life, you must realize that Christianity is not a “Lone Ranger” religion. The church is here to bind together and win the battle together.
<br /><br />Sabine Baring-Gould wrote the famous hymn “Onward Christian Soldiers.” One stanza really stands out in this regard: “Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane, But the church of Jesus constant will remain. Gates of hell can never against that church prevail; We have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.”
<br /><br />Jesus loves the Church, which is His body. If we love Jesus, we will love what He loves.

<br /><br />The Lord provides a sufficient portion of strength when we are feeling weak and beaten down. He sustains us when we are anxious, discouraged, frustrated and tired. He promises that when we stumble, He will give us His grace and mercy.
<br /><br />Most importantly, no matter how long we spin our wheels trying to find joy and satisfaction in earthly things, God patiently offers Himself and waits for us to realize that what we really need is a bigger portion of Him.
<br /><br />In Hebrew, the word &quot;portion&quot; is translated as &quot;inheritance&quot; or &quot;allotment.&quot; What if we thought of God's portion as our inheritance? Could we embrace the truth that He gives us everything He is; and we can have as much as we desire?
<br /><br />When we come to Jesus with the hungers of our heart, He provides the perfect portion to fill our longings, heal our wounds and meet our unmet needs. When it comes to God and His Word, we can always eat out of the gallon!

<br /><br />Job said, “I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my necessary food” (Job 23:12). In other words, Job was saying that if he had to choose between eating physical bread or spiritual bread, he would rather have the Word of God.

<br /><br />Why do you think we return to God time and time again asking Him to forgive us? I think it is partly because we fail to pray the other part of the Lord’s Prayer: “And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”
<br /><br />We wake up in the morning, come to the end of the day, and we say, “God, forgive me. I blew it.” And He does. Do you know why we fail? We’ve learned how to pray “Lord, forgive me.” But we’re not praying, “Lord, protect me.”
<br /><br />You wouldn’t come to the end of the day and say, “Lord, give me this day my daily bread.” The day is over. “Lord, protect me” is not a prayer for the end of the day; this is the prayer to begin your day.
<br /><br />Each day this week, begin your day with this prayer. Let it become a habit. Expand your prayer to encompass putting on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18).

<br /><br />When Jesus Christ died, not only did He die for us, but also we died with Him. You may say, “Well, what difference does it make whether He died for me or I died with Him? It’s just a play on words.” Oh no it’s not, dear friend.
<br /><br />When you’re dead, then death has no dominion over you. You can’t kill a man who is already dead. Let’s suppose a man is put to death for a capital crime he has committed, and yet somehow he is raised back to life. Do you think he can be arrested again for his crime? Absolutely not. That would be double jeopardy. He paid the penalty for his crime.
<br /><br />It is necessary that you understand that when Jesus died, you died, and the law has no more hold on you! Your sin debt has been paid in full because He died for you. You died with Him.

<br /><br />There are five qualities of friendship.
<br /><br />1. Harmony. We are to be of one mind, not necessarily singing the same note, but complimenting one another.
<br /><br />2. Sympathy. We hurt when friends hurt. The world is looking for friends like this.
<br /><br />3. Fraternity. We are to love one another like brothers. There is no brotherhood like the brotherhood in Jesus Christ.
<br /><br />4. Pity. If you want to be a real friend, you’re going to have to feel deeply. You’ll need to put yourself in the place of the other person.
<br /><br />5. Humility. Genuine courtesy is thinking of the other person’s needs before your own. You are less concerned with your rights, and more concerned about the relationship.
<br /><br />Begin to develop these characteristics of friendship in your life and watch God change your world!
