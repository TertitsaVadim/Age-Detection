<br /><br />2. If the shoe fits - buy one in every colour.
<br /><br />3. Take life with a pinch of salt... a wedge of lime, and a shot of tequila.
<br /><br />4. In need of a support group? - Cocktail hour with the girls!
<br /><br />5. Go on the 30 day diet. (I'm on it and so far I've lost 15 days).
<br /><br />6. When life gets you down - just put on your big girl panties and deal with it.
<br /><br />7. Let your greatest fear be that there is no PMS and this is just my personality.
<br /><br />8. I know I'm in my own little world, but it's ok. They know me here.
<br /><br />9. Lead me not into temptation, I can find it myself.
<br /><br />10. Don't get your knickers in a knot, it solves nothing; and makes you walk funny.
<br /><br />11. When life gives you lemons in 2008 - turn it into lemonade then mix it with vodka.
<br /><br />12. Remember every good looking; sweet, single male is someone else's ex-boyfriend!

He told me he loved me and was very upset at leaving me, but I knew that it was something that he had to do, as I couldn't stop him doing what he felt he needed to do as I'd had a similar experience myself (but only move from England to Scotland UK and he is just meant to be travelling).  Plus if you don't let someone do what they want to do it can cause all sorts of problems later in life and regrets.  I haven't heard anything from him since December 06 when we talked on Skype.  I log on to Skype a lot to see if we are ever on at the same time, and I have found out this week that he had deleted me as his friend I've also found out that he has been in touch with all of his mates over here.  It really hurts to find out that after being with him on and off for 6 years that he's just thrown me aside like this.  But I guess in the long run he will be the looser. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
