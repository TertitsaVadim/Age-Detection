<br />hot girl in his office... but she was dating someone else.
<br />One day Eddie got so frustrated that he went to her and said, &quot;I'll
<br />give you $100 if you let me have sex with you...&quot;The girl looked at
<br />him, and then said, &quot;NO!&quot;
<br />Eddie said, &quot;I'll be real fast. I'll throw the money on the floor,
<br />you bend down and I'll finish by the time you've picked it up.&quot;
<br />She thought for a moment and said that she would consult with her
<br />boy friend...so she called him and explained the situation.
<br />Her boyfriend says, &quot;Ask him for $200, and pick up the money really
<br />fast. He won't even be able to get his pants down.&quot; She agreed and
<br />accepts the proposal.
<br />Over half an hour goes by and the boyfriend is still waiting for his
<br />girlfriend's call. Finally, after 45 minutes the boyfriend calls and
<br />asks what happened...?
<br />Still breathing hard, she managed to reply, &quot;The bastard had all
<br />quarters!&quot;
<br />Management lesson: Always consider a business proposition in its'
<br />entirety before agreeing to it and getting screwed

<br /><br />&gt; There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on 
<br />&gt; their farm. He was given a slingshot to play with out 
<br />&gt; in the woods. He practiced in the woods; but he could 
<br />&gt; never hit the target. Getting a little discouraged, he 
<br />&gt; headed back for dinner. As he was walking back he saw 
<br />&gt; Grandma's pet duck. Just out of impulse, he let the 
<br />&gt; slingshot fly, hit the duck square in the head and 
<br />&gt; killed it. He was shocked and grieved! 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood pile; 
<br />&gt; only to see his sister watching! Sally had seen it 
<br />&gt; all, but she said nothing. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; After lunch the next day Grandma said, &quot;Sally, let's 
<br />&gt; wash the dishes&quot; But Sally said, &quot;Grandma , Johnny told 
<br />&gt; me he wanted to help in the kitchen.&quot; Then she 
<br />&gt; whispered t o him, &quot;Remember the duck?&quot; So Johnny did 
<br />&gt; the dishes. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Later that day, Grandpa asked if the children wanted 
<br />&gt; to go fishing and Grandma said, &quot;I'm sorry but I need 
<br />&gt; Sally to help make supper.&quot; Sally just smiled and 
<br />&gt; said, &quot;Well that's all right because Johnny told me he 
<br />&gt; wanted to help&quot; She whispered again, &quot;Remember the 
<br />&gt; duck?&quot; So Sally went fishing and Johnny stayed to help 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; After several days of Johnny doing both his chores and 
<br />&gt; Sally's; he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came 
<br />&gt; to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Grandma knelt down, gave him a hug and said, 
<br />&gt; &quot;Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the 
<br />&gt; window and I saw the whole thing, but because I love 
<br />&gt; you, I forgave you. I was just wondering how long you 
<br />&gt; would let Sally make a slave of you.&quot; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Thought for the day and every day thereafter? 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Whatever is in your past, whatever you have done... 
<br />&gt; and the devil keeps throwing it up in your face 
<br />&gt; (lying, cheating, debt, fear, bad habits, hatred, 
<br />&gt; anger, bitterness, etc.)...whatever it is ..You need 
<br />&gt; to know that God was standing at the window and He saw 
<br />&gt; the whole thing. He has seen your whole life. He wants you to 
<br />&gt; know that He loves you and that you are forgiven. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; He's just wondering how long you will let the devil 
<br />&gt; make a slave of you. The great thing about God is 
<br />&gt; that when you ask for forgiveness; He not only 
<br />&gt; forgives you, but He forgets. It is by God's grace and 
<br />&gt; mercy that we are saved. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Go ahead and make the difference in someone's life 
<br />&gt; today. Share this with a friend and always remember: 
<br />&gt; God is at the window!

<br /><br />This is a true story.  It all started on August 21, 2000.  My ex daughter in laws best friend came down from Paducah, Kentucky to visit her.  Her name is Ginger Elaine Davis and she has gotten herself pregnant by a guy she doesn’t even know that was a one night stand with a guy on an army base.  Her parents dad (name withheld since he is nice and a puppet on her string) and Cindy Davis (nasty ass controlling bitch) have thrown her out of their house because of this.  She has nowhere to go.  She walks into our house and steals a glance at our son, Richard Drew Forrest.  She falls madly in love at first sight.  She was not aware that this glance would steal her hurt for eternity. She comes to me and asks if it is ok for her to date him since she is 19 and he is only 16.  I give her my blessings, believing this is just one more tryst in my son’s young life. (boy did I ever nail this one wrong)  This was a world win romance that moved so fast. The next 6 months was spent with her and Drew picking out names for their son (not really Drews).  On March 17, 2000 their son, Awstyn Drew Forrest was born.   Boy did trouble start then.  Her mom came down from Paducah and had security to make me and Drew leave the hospital.  We wouldn’t allow Drew to talk to her anymore after this.  Many calls from Ginger crying and begging us to come see her at the hospital, me and Drew went to see her and I got the privilege to tell her mom what I truly thought of a person controlling their daughter and her being 19.  We visited with Ginger several more times that week and then her mom forced her to return to Kentucky with her when Awstyn was a week old and change his name to Awstyn Gage Davis.  Ginger did this like a puppet on a string.  Only two weeks later Ginger made her way back to Arkansas and to the man she loved.  Then more trouble came up.  Her mom along with the Drew County Sheriffs Department came to our house and removed her 3 week old son  away from her and Drew.   Trouble really started then.  The judge gave temporary custody to her mom.  On October 8, 2001 Drew came to us and ask us if we would give him permission to marry Ginger.  We gave him our blessing.  On December, 25, 2001 at 3:00 a.m. Drew woke Ginger, me, his dad, his brothers Jay and Daniel up and bent down on one knee and told Ginger how much he loved her and asked her to marry him and spend eternity with him.  Ginger said yes and Drew placed her engagement ring on her finger.  This is her one and only chance of a lifetime to be with the man of her dreams and it only happened once in a lifetime.  On January 5, 2002 and after many court battles and tons of money, lots of support from many people and the Drew County Sheriffs Department, (who made a trip to Kentucky to testify in court for us) we were able to  bring  Awstyn back to Arkansas to be with his true family.  Everything was going so well with them making plans for a beautiful small church wedding.  Upon finding out that the two of them were to be married her parents, Dad (name withheld since he is a nice person) and Cindy Davis refused to attend their wedding.  Low and behold, her mom is at it again.  There was a supposedly paternity test done on John Ashley Lamar (who is a man her mom found to say he was his father but Ginger doesn’t remember being with since high school) while Awstyn was in Kentucky with his grandmother, Cindy Davis and it was positive.  Another court order demands her to change Awstyn’s name again, to Awstyn Gage Lamar and to allow this man visitation.  This still didn’t put a stop to these love struck kids and they were married on February 14, 2002 in a beautiful fairy book wedding(see wedding pic of Drew and Ginger’s  wedding in photo album).  They were so happy and  in love.  You could see much love in their eyes.  The next few weeks was spent trying to buy them a house and settling things with that and court.  On March 9, 2002 Drew carried Ginger to Kentucky to get some of her things at her parents house and for visitation with Ashley Lamar for Awstyn.  While there Ashley and Carolyn Lamar Paschall (nicknamed by ginger slutty bitch of Kentucky that steals everyones kids ) started a fight with Ginger and growing more and more confused over all the hollering she agreed to stay with her son while he was in Kentucky and leaving all her belongings back in Arkansas.   Drew returned to Arkansas without Ginger or Awstyn (Drew’s life stopped at that moment).  The following Monday Drew filed for divorce and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.  Nine days later Ginger was at a friends house and called to tell us that she was pregnant with Drew’s child.  For the next week or so Ginger and Drew talked a lot about what to name their child and decided on Braylee Alexys Forrest (see pic of Braylee and Drew) but then she told Drew that the baby was not his and then she stopped calling and we couldn’t get back in touch with her.   On April 30, 2002 their divorce was final and on May 10, 2002 she was told by her mom, Cindy that if she didn’t marry John Ashley Lamar then she would lose her son forever.  She was scared and agreed.  Drew was due to leave July 27, 2002 but it was my birthday so he didn’t have to leave until July 29, 2002.  On December 11, 2002 Braylee Alexys Lamar was born.  This name is the one that Ginger and Drew picked out.  Just one more thing Ginger has done to keep Drew in her life.  Upon receiving this information I called my son in Iraq and he then called Ginger and asked her if this child is his and she at first said yes but then after awhile she told him no.  About a year later she openly admitted to emailing a girlfriend of Drew’s and telling her to leave him along that he was hers and she would get him back one day.   We had to have our home phone numbers and cell phone numbers changed 9 different times in to keep her from bothering us through the years.   From then until now she has sent me pics of Braylee and kept me up to date with her life.  She had another child on September 1, 2005, she even sent me pictures of this one too.  There is only one explanation from her and why she has continued to do all of this.  She loves him and cant get him out of her heart.  On July 27, 2006 I was online talking on yahoo and she sent me a message and wanted to know if we could talk on the phone, so the good person that I am I gave her the benefit of the doubt and allowed her to know my phone number one more time so she could call.  Drew had just gotten out of the Marines so her and him talked until December 14, 2006.  She was suppose to have the results of a paternity test done on Braylee and we were going to find out for sure but on December 15, 2006 we couldn’t get in touch with her once again.  She called a few more times and I finally started pushing this button about a message saying we didn’t want to talk to her and she stopped calling.  On January 4, 2007 Ginger was diagnosed as having Bi-Polar Disease.   On August 20, 2007 she called and said she was on her way down here to see us.  On August 21, 2007 her and her three children showed up at our door after five years and not seeing her at all.  Everyone was ok with her coming back down and was glad to see her once again.  The first glance between her and Drew was awkward, but then it was dejavu all over again.  She immediately moved in with him and they picked up where they left off 5 years ago.  She had supper cooked every night when he got home and kept an immaculate clean house.  She bought anywhere from $500.00 to $700.00 in groceries every month here for my house and then what ever Drew needed she bought for him and no one asked her to do it.  Here we go again with her and court.  The Lamars filed for emergency custody and took her kids away again.  On August 30, 2007 I went with her to court in Paducah, Kentucky but she lost the kids to temporary custody for the dad, John Ashley Lamar.  The judge asked her if she would move back to Kentucky for her kids and she told her no she loved Drew and was living in Arkansas so the judge scheduled visitation every other weekend for her two oldest and her baby she gets for a week every other week and she is to provide all transportation.  She came back, found her a job, bought her a car, and we changed her address to a different one instead of Drew’s, for custody purposes.  The past 2 months we have been going to Kentucky every weekend for visitation with her kids and Drew and myself have given her $150.00 a week for the trips.  On October 3, 2007 her attorney called to inform her that she needed $1000.00 to finish the divorce.  On October 5, 2007 my husband Paul told her that when she returned from Kentucky she was going to have to park the mustang that we helped her buy since she couldn’t pay for it.  On October 6, 2007 she went to Kevil, Kentucky for visitation with her kids and on October 8, 2007 she called to tell me that she was going to go back to her husband, John Ashley Lamar and get more information on him so she could take the kids aways from him for good this time.  She informed me then that me and her had to come up with a plan so the Lamars would believe she was mad at me and Drew and didn’t want anything else to do with us.  We have done that by making them believe that I filed charges on her for stealing my car and going to Kentucky and do not want any thing further to do with her.  During this process, Carolyn the mom in law asked me to testify against her in court for custody of the kids and that she was going to take those kids away from her once and for all.  She has contacted Drew two more times since then to assure him that she still loves him and will be back.  She has once again left everything she owns at my house, where it will stay just like she left it until her return.  She comes into our lives like a figure in the shadow and then she is out as fast as she came in just like when the sun leaves a shadow.  I have talked to a couple of her friends from Kentucky and they said she told them she wasn’t going back to her husband she was going to get custody of her kids and see them go to prison for drugs.  These friends are very reliable ones too.  She lives in a trailer in Kevil, Kentucky that has holes all in the walls from her husband hitting it instead of her or the kids(pics to prove it).  She was only sleeping with her husband three times a year and he had to begged for it then.  She told us that she hated the Lamars, especially Carolyn and that they were thieves and drug dealers.  She told me of all the things that Carolyn Lamar stole from my house when I was gone.  She has told us that she can have no friends, so why would she want to go back to a life of misery and loneliness like that.  Drew was engaged to a wonderful girl in California but it couldn’t work because he had no closure on this situation but now I fill as if he can.  He also was having a great life without her in it but his heart was still with her unfortunately.  He is talking with the girl from California again now and it hasn’t been a week yet.  Maybe he can continue his life and find the woman of his dreams now.
<br /><br />What I would like to know is your opinion on this situation and do you think that she is for real, and really loves our son or just a damn good con artist that has us all fooled?  What you would do in this situation?  Would you help her when she returned or would you depart from her forever and go on with our lives without her in it.  
<br /><br />NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY.

<br />When the road your trudging seems all uphill,
<br />When the funds are low and the debts are high,
<br />And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
<br />When care is pressing you down a bit
<br />Rest if you must, but don't you quit.
<br /><br />Life is queer with its twists and its turns,
<br />As everyone of us sometimes learns,
<br />And many a failure turns about
<br />When they might have won, had they stuck it out.
<br />Don't give up though the pace seems slow,
<br />You may succeed with another blow.
<br /><br />Often the struggler has given up
<br />When he might have captured the victors cup;
<br />And he learned too late when the night came down,
<br />How close he was to the golden crown.
<br /><br />Success is failure turned inside out
<br />The silver tint of the clouds of doubt
<br />And you never can tell how close you are,
<br />It may be near when it seems so far;
<br />So stick to the fight when your hardest hit,
<br />It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit! 
<br /><br />To laugh is to risk appearing a fool.
<br />To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.
<br />To reach out to another is to risk involvement.
<br />To expose your feelings is to risk rejection.
<br />To place your dreams before the crowd is to risk ridicule.
<br />To love is to risk not being loved in return.
<br />To go forward in the face of overwhelming odds
<br />is to risk failure.
<br />But risks must be taken,
<br />because the greatest risk of all is to risk nothing.
<br />The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing and is nothing.
<br />He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he cannot learn, he cannot feel,
<br />he cannot change, he cannot grow and he cannot love.
<br />Chained by his certitudes, he is a slave.
<br />Only the person who risks is truly FREE

<br /><br />A nice, calm, respectable lady went into the pharmacy,
<br />walked up to the pharmacist, looked straight into his eyes,

<br /><br />The pharmacist asked, &quot;Why in the world do you need
<br />cyanide?&quot;
<br /><br />The lady replied, &quot;I need it to poison my husband.&quot;
<br /><br />The pharmacist's eyes got big and he exclaimed, &quot;I can't
<br />give you cyanide to kill your husband. That's against the
<br />law! I will lose my license! They'll throw both of us in
<br />jail! All kinds of bad things will happen. Absolutely not!
<br />You CANNOT have any cyanide!&quot;
<br /><br />The lady reached into her purse and pulled out a picture of

<br /><br />Four married guys go fishing. After an hour, the following conversation took place: 
<br /><br />First guy: &quot;You have no idea what I had to do to be able to come out fishing this weekend. I had to promise my wife that I would paint every room in the house next weekend&quot;
<br /><br />Second guy: &quot;That's nothing, I had to promise my wife that I would build her a new deck for the pool.&quot;
<br /><br />Third guy: &quot;Man, you both have it easy! I had to promise my wife that I would remodel the kitchen for her.&quot;
<br /><br />They continue to fish. When they realized that the fourth guy has not said a word, they asked him. 
<br /><br />&quot;You haven't said anything about what you had to do to be able to come fishing this weekend. 
<br /><br />What's the deal?&quot;
<br /><br />Fourth guy: &quot;I just set my alarm for 5:30 am. When it went off, I shut off my alarm, gave the wife a slap on her butt and said:

My friend, Arlene, was nervous about the weekend. The boss was very wealthy, with a fine home on the waterway, and cars costing more than her house 
<br />The first day and evening went well, and Arlene was delighted to have this rare glimpse into how the very wealthy live. The husband's employer was quite generous as a host, and took them to the finest restaurants. Arlene knew she would never have the opportunity to indulge in this kind of extravagance again, so was enjoying herself immensely. 
<br /><br />As the three of them w ere about to enter an exclusive restaurant that evening, the boss was walking slightly ahead of Arlene and her husband.
<br />He stopped suddenly, looking down on the pavement for a long, silent moment. 
<br /><br />Arlene wondered if she was supposed to pass him. There was nothing on the ground except a single darkened penny that someone had dropped, and a few cigarette butts Still silent, the man reached down and picked up the penny. 
<br /><br />He held it up and smiled, then put it in his pocket as if he had found a great treasure. How absurd! What need did this man have for a single penny? Why would he even take the time to stop and pick it up?
<br /><br />Throughout dinner, the entire scene nagged at her. Finally, she could stand it no longer. She casually mentioned that her daughter once had a coin collection, and asked if the penny he had found had been of some value. 
<br /><br />A smile crept across the man's face as he reached into his pocket for the penny and held it out for her to see. She had seen many pennies before! What was the point of this?
<br />&quot;Look at it.&quot; He said. &quot;Read what it says.&quot; She read the words &quot; United States of America &quot; 
<br />&quot;No, not that; read further.&quot;
<br />&quot;One cent?&quot; &quot;No, keep reading.&quot;
<br />&quot;In God we Trust?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; &quot;And?&quot;
<br />&quot;And if I trust in God, the name of God is holy, even on a coin. Whenever I find a coin I see that inscription. It is written on every single United States coin, but we never seem to notice it! God drops a message right in front of me telling me to trust Him? Who am I to pass it by? When I see a coin, I pray, I stop to see if my trust IS in God at that moment. I pick the coin up as a response to God; that I do trust in Him. For a short time, at least, I cherish it as if it were gold. I think it is God's way of starting a conversation with me. Lucky for me, God is patient and pennies are plentiful! 
<br /><br />When I was out shopping today, I found a penny on the sidewalk. I stopped and picked it up, and realized that I had been worrying and fretting in my mind about things I cannot change. I read the words, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; and had to laugh. Yes, God, I get the message. 
<br /><br />It seems that I have been finding an inordinate number of pennies in the last few months, but then, pennies are plentiful! And, God is patient..
<br />The best mathematical equation I have ever seen:
<br />1 cross
<br />+ 3 nails 
<br />--------
<br />4 given
<br /><br />That's the whole gospel message simply stated.

<br /><br />Dear Mr. Thatcher,
<br /><br />I have been a loyal user of your 'Always' maxi pads for over 20 years and I appreciate many of their features. Why, without the Leak Guard Core or Dri-Weave absorbency, I'd probably never go horseback riding or salsa dancing, and I'd certainly steer clear of running up and down the beach in tight, white shorts. 
<br /><br />But my favorite feature has to be your revolutionary Flexi-Wings. Kudos on being the only company smart enough to realize how crucial it is that maxi pads be aerodynamic. I can't tell you how safe and secure I feel each month knowing there's a little F-16 in my pants. 
<br /><br />Have you ever had a menstrual period, Mr. Thatcher? Ever suffered from 'the curse'? I'm guessing you haven't. Well, my time of the month is starting right now. As I type, I can already feel hormonal forces violently surging through my body. Just a few minutes from now, my body will adjust and I'll be transformed into what my husband likes to call 'an inbred hillbilly with knife skills.' Isn't the human body amazing? 
<br /><br />As Brand Manager in the Feminine-Hygiene Division, you've no doubt seen quite a bit of research on what exactly happens during your customers monthly visits from 'Aunt Flo'. Therefore, you must know about the bloating, puffiness, and cramping we endure, and about our intense mood swings, crying, jags, and out-of-control behavior. You surely realize it's a tough time for most women. In fact, only last week, my friend Jennifer fought the violent urge to shove her boyfriend's testicles into a George Foreman Grill just because he told her he thought Grey's Anatomy was written by drunken chimps. Crazy! 
<br /><br />The point is, sir, you of all people must realize that America is just crawling with homicidal maniacs in Capri pants... Which brings me to the reason for my letter. 
<br /><br />Last month, while in the throes of cramping so painful I wanted to reach inside my body and yank out my uterus, I opened an Always maxi-pad, and there, printed on the adhesive backing, were these words: 'Have a Happy Period.' 
<br /><br />Are you fu*ing kidding me? What I mean is, does any part of your tiny middle-manager brain really think happiness - actual smiling, laughing happiness is possible during a menstrual period? Did anything mentioned above sound the least bit pleasurable? Well, did it, James? 
<br /><br />FYI, unless you're some kind of sick S&amp;M freak girl, there will never be anything 'happy' about a day in which you have to jack yourself up on Motrin and Kahlua and lock yourself in your house just so you don't march down to the local Walgreen's armed with a hunting rifle and a sketchy plan to end your life in a blaze of glory. 
<br /><br />For the love of God, pull your head out, man! If you just have to slap a moronic message on a maxi pad, wouldn't it make more sense to say something that's actually pertinent, like 'Put down the Hammer' or 'Vehicular Manslaughter is Wrong', or are you just picking on us? 
<br /><br />Sir, please inform your Accounting Department that, effective immediately, there will be an $8 drop in monthly profits, for I have chosen to take my maxi-pad business elsewhere. And though I will certainly miss your Flex-Wings, I will not for one minute miss your brand of condescending bull sh*t. And that's a promise I will keep. Always. 
<br /><br />Best,

<br />&quot;I've got problems. Every time I go to bed I think there's somebody under it. I'm scared. I think I'm going crazy.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Just put yourself in my hands for one year,&quot; said the shrink. &quot;Come talk to me three times a week, and we should be able to get rid of those fears.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;How much do you charge?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Eighty dollars per visit, replied the doctor.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'll sleep on it,&quot; said Bubba.
<br /><br />Six months later the doctor met Bubba on the street. &quot;Why didn't you ever come to see me about those fears you were having?&quot; asked the psychiatrist.
<br /><br />&quot;Well Eighty bucks a visit three times a week for a year is an awful lot of money! A bartender cured me for $10.00 I was so happy to have saved all that money that I went and bought me a new pickup!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Is that so! And how, may I ask, did a bartender cure you?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;He told me to cut the legs off the bed! - Ain't nobody under there now !!!&quot;

<br /><br />From the county where drunk driving is considered a sport, comes this true story.
<br /><br />Recently a routine police patrol parked outside of a bar in California. After last call the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so apparently intoxicated that he could barely walk.The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it. He sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off -- it was a fine, dry summer night -- flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left. At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyzer test. To his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all !!!Dumbfounded, the officer said, I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. This breathalyzer equipment must be broken.&quot;&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said the truly proud Californian, &quot;Tonight I'm the designated decoy&quot;

<br /><br />This is a true story.  It all started on August 21, 2000.  My ex daughter in laws best friend came down from Paducah, Kentucky to visit her.  Her name is Ginger Elaine Davis and she has gotten herself pregnant by a guy she doesn’t even know that was a one night stand with a guy on an army base.  Her parents dad (name withheld since he is nice and a puppet on her string) and Cindy Davis (nasty ass controlling bitch) have thrown her out of their house because of this.  She has nowhere to go.  She walks into our house and steals a glance at our son.  She falls madly in love at first sight.  She was not aware that this glance would steal her hurt for eternity. She comes to me and asks if it is ok for her to date him since she is 19 and he is only 16.  I give her my blessings, believing this is just one more tryst in my son’s young life. (boy did I ever nail this one wrong)  This was a world win romance that moved so fast. The next 6 months was spent with her and Drew picking out names for their son (not really Drews).  On March 17, 2000 their son, Awstyn Drew Forrest was born.   Boy did trouble start then.  Her mom came down from Paducah and had security to make me and Drew leave the hospital.  We wouldn’t allow Drew to talk to her anymore after this.  Many calls from Ginger crying and begging us to come see her at the hospital, me and Drew went to see her and I got the privilege to tell her mom what I truly thought of a person controlling their daughter and her being 19.  We visited with Ginger several more times that week and then her mom forced her to return to Kentucky with her when Awstyn was a week old and change his name to Awstyn Gage Davis.  Ginger did this like a puppet on a string.  Only two weeks later Ginger made her way back to Arkansas and to the man she loved.  Then more trouble came up.  Her mom along with the Drew County Sheriffs Department came to our house and removed her 3 week old son  away from her and Drew.   Trouble really started then.  The judge gave temporary custody to her mom.  On October 8, 2001 Drew came to us and ask us if we would give him permission to marry Ginger.  We gave him our blessing.  On December, 25, 2001 at 3:00 a.m. Drew woke Ginger, me, his dad, his brothers Jay and Daniel up and bent down on one knee and told Ginger how much he loved her and asked her to marry him and spend eternity with him.  Ginger said yes and Drew placed her engagement ring on her finger.  This is her one and only chance of a lifetime to be with the man of her dreams and it only happened once in a lifetime.  On January 5, 2002 and after many court battles and tons of money, lots of support from many people and the Drew County Sheriffs Department, (who made a trip to Kentucky to testify in court for us) we were able to  bring  Awstyn back to Arkansas to be with his true family.  Everything was going so well with them making plans for a beautiful small church wedding.  Upon finding out that the two of them were to be married her parents, Dad (name withheld since he is a nice person) and Cindy Davis refused to attend their wedding.  Low and behold, her mom is at it again.  There was a supposedly paternity test done on John Ashley Lamar (who is a man her mom found to say he was his father but Ginger doesn’t remember being with since high school) while Awstyn was in Kentucky with his grandmother, Cindy Davis and it was positive.  Another court order demands her to change Awstyn’s name again, to Awstyn Gage Lamar and to allow this man visitation.  This still didn’t put a stop to these love struck kids and they were married on February 14, 2002 in a beautiful fairy book wedding(see wedding pic of Drew and Ginger’s  wedding in photo album).  They were so happy and  in love.  You could see much love in their eyes.  The next few weeks was spent trying to buy them a house and settling things with that and court.  On March 9, 2002 Drew carried Ginger to Kentucky to get some of her things at her parents house and for visitation with Ashley Lamar for Awstyn.  While there Ashley and Carolyn Lamar Paschall (nicknamed by ginger slutty bitch of Kentucky that steals everyones kids ) started a fight with Ginger and growing more and more confused over all the hollering she agreed to stay with her son while he was in Kentucky and leaving all her belongings back in Arkansas.   Drew returned to Arkansas without Ginger or Awstyn (Drew’s life stopped at that moment).  The following Monday Drew filed for divorce and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.  Nine days later Ginger was at a friends house and called to tell us that she was pregnant with Drew’s child.  For the next week or so Ginger and Drew talked a lot about what to name their child and decided on Braylee Alexys Forrest (see pic of Braylee and Drew) but then she told Drew that the baby was not his and then she stopped calling and we couldn’t get back in touch with her.   On April 30, 2002 their divorce was final and on May 10, 2002 she was told by her mom, Cindy that if she didn’t marry John Ashley Lamar then she would lose her son forever.  She was scared and agreed.  Drew was due to leave July 27, 2002 but it was my birthday so he didn’t have to leave until July 29, 2002.  On December 11, 2002 Braylee Alexys Lamar was born.  Paternity test results will reveal the truth about this little girl.  This name is the one that Ginger and Drew picked out.  Just one more thing Ginger has done to keep Drew in her life.  Upon receiving this information I called my son in Iraq and he then called Ginger and asked her if this child is his and she at first said yes but then after awhile she told him no.  About a year later she openly admitted to emailing a girlfriend of Drew’s and telling her to leave him along that he was hers and she would get him back one day.   We had to have our home phone numbers and cell phone numbers changed 9 different times in order to keep her from bothering us through the years.  From then until now she has sent me pics of Braylee and kept me up to date with her life.  She had an.   other child on September 1, 2005, she even sent me pictures of this one too.  There is only one explanation from her and why she has continued to do all of this.  She loves him and cant get him out of her heart.  On July 27, 2006 I was online talking on yahoo and she sent me a message and wanted to know if we could talk on the phone, so the good person that I am I gave her the benefit of the doubt and allowed her to know my phone number one more time so she could call.  Drew had just gotten out of the Marines so her and him talked until December 14, 2006.  She was suppose to have the results of a paternity test done on Braylee and we were going to find out for sure but on December 15, 2006 we couldn’t get in touch with her once again.  She called a few more times and I finally started pushing this button about a message saying we didn’t want to talk to her and she stopped calling.  On January 4, 2007 Ginger was diagnosed as having Bi-Polar Disease.   On August 20, 2007 she called and said she was on her way down here to see us.  On August 21, 2007 her and her three children showed up at our door after five years and not seeing her at all.  Everyone was ok with her coming back down and was glad to see her once again.  The first glance between her and Drew was awkward, but then it was dejavu all over again.  She immediately moved in with him and they picked up where they left off 5 years ago.  She had supper cooked every night when he got home and kept an immaculate clean house.  She bought anywhere from $500.00 to $700.00 in groceries every month here for my house and then what ever Drew needed she bought for him and no one asked her to do it.  Here we go again with her and court.  The Lamars filed for emergency custody and took her kids away again.  On August 30, 2007 I went with her to court in Paducah, Kentucky but she lost the kids to temporary custody for the dad, John Ashley Lamar.  The judge asked her if she would move back to Kentucky for her kids and she told her no she loved Drew and was living in Arkansas so the judge scheduled visitation every other weekend for her two oldest and her baby she gets for a week every other week and she is to provide all transportation.  She came back, found her a job, bought her a car, and we changed her address to a different one instead of Drew’s, for custody purposes.  The past 2 months we have been going to Kentucky every weekend for visitation with her kids and Drew and myself have given her $150.00 a week for the trips.  On October 3, 2007 her attorney called to inform her that she needed $1000.00 to finish the divorce.  On October 5, 2007 my husband Paul told her that when she returned from Kentucky she was going to have to park the mustang that we helped her buy since she couldn’t pay for it.  On October 6, 2007 she went to Kevil, Kentucky for visitation with her kids and on October 8, 2007 she called to tell me that she was going to go back to her husband, John Ashley Lamar and get more information on him so she could take the kids aways from him for good this time.  She informed me then that me and her had to come up with a plan so the Lamars would believe she was mad at me and Drew and didn’t want anything else to do with us.  We have done that by making them believe that I filed charges on her for stealing my car and going to Kentucky and do not want any thing further to do with her.  During this process, Carolyn the mom in law asked me to testify against her in court for custody of the kids and that she was going to take those kids away from her once and for all.  She has contacted Drew two more times since then to assure him that she still loves him and will be back.  She has once again left everything she owns at my house, where it will stay just like she left it until her return.  She comes into our lives like a figure in the shadow and then she is out as fast as she came in just like when the sun leaves a shadow.  I have talked to a couple of her friends from Kentucky and they said she told them she wasn’t going back to her husband she was going to get custody of her kids and see them go to prison for drugs.  These friends are very reliable ones too.  She lives in a trailer in Kevil, Kentucky that has holes all in the walls from her husband hitting it instead of her or the kids(pics to prove it).  She was only sleeping with her husband three times a year and he had to begged for it then.  She told us that she hated the Lamars, especially Carolyn and that they were thieves and drug dealers.  She told me of all the things that Carolyn Lamar stole from my house when I was gone.  She has told us that she can have no friends, so why would she want to go back to a life of misery and loneliness like that.  Drew was engaged to a wonderful girl in California but it couldn’t work because he had no closure on this situation but now I fill as if he can.  He also was having a great life without her in it but his heart was still with her unfortunately.  He is talking with the girl from California again but she has a boyfriend now so no telling how that will turn out.  Maybe he can continue his life and find the woman of his dreams now.  My advice is to all that know any of these people involved to stay far away from them because they are trouble. 
<br /><br />What I would like to know is your opinion on this situation and do you think that she is for real, and really loves our son or just a damn good con artist that has us all fooled?  What you would do in this situation?  Would you help her when she returned or would you depart from her forever and go on with our lives without her in it.  
<br /><br />NOW YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY.

<br /><br />The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from his body because he was too skinny.
<br />So the wife offered to donate some of her own skin.
<br />However, the only skin on her body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from her buttocks.
<br />The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the Skin came from, and they requested that 
<br />the doctor also honor their secret.
<br />After all, this was a very delicate matter.

<br />Enjoy,
<br />Sarah
<br /><br />I, the Penis, hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons:
<br />I do physical labor.
<br />I work at great depths.
<br />I plunge headfirst into everything I do.
<br />I do not get weekends or public holidays off.
<br />I work in a damp environment.
<br />I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation.
<br />I work in high temperatures.
<br />Sincerely,
<br />Mr. P. Niss
<br /><br />The Response:
<br /><br />Dear Mr. P. Niss:
<br />After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons:
<br />You do not work 8 hours straight.
<br />You fall asleep after brief work periods.
<br />You do not always follow the orders of the management team.
<br />You do not stay in your designated area and are often seen visiting other locations.
<br />You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in 
<br />order to start working.
<br />You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift.
<br />You will retire well before you are 65.
<br />You are unable to work double shifts.
<br />You sometimes leave your designated work area before you have completed assigned task. And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and exiting the workplace carrying two suspicious looking bags.
<br />Sincerely,
<br />Miss V. Gina

The crocodile said that he had to check this out and walked into the rain forest, found the tree where the koala was sitting finishing a joint.

<br /><br />One day the old poodle starts chasing butterflies and before long, Cuddles discovers that he's lost. Wandering about, he notice's a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch. 
<br /><br />The old poodle thinks, &quot;Oh, oh! I'm in deep doo-doo now!&quot; Noticing some bones close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap the old poodle exclaims loudly, &quot;Boy, that was one delicious leopard! I wonder if there are any more around here?&quot;
<br /><br />Hearing this, the young leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. &quot;Whew!&quot;, says the leopard, &quot;That was close! That old poodle nearly had me!&quot;
<br /><br />Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the old poodle sees him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something must be up. 
<br /><br />The monkey soons catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard.
<br /><br />The young leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, &quot;Here monkey, hop on my back and see what's going to happen to conniving canine!&quot;
<br /><br />Now the old poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and thinks, &quot;What am I going to do now?&quot;, but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn't seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old poodle says....
<br /><br />&quot;Where is that damn monkey? I sent him off an hour ago to bring me another leopard!

<br /><br />If everyone can remember something this simple, we could save some folks. Seriously.. 
<br /><br />Please read: 
<br /><br />STROKE IDENTIFICATION: 
<br />During a BBQ, a friend stumbled and took a little fall - she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) .....she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. 
<br /><br />They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up, Ingrid went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. 
<br /><br />Ingrid's husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital - (at 6:00 PM Ingrid passed away.) She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Ingrid would be with us today. Some don't die.... they end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead. 
<br /><br />It only takes a minute to read this... 
<br />A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke... totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough. 
<br /><br />RECOGNIZING A STROKE 
<br />Thank God for the sense to remember the '3' steps, STR .. Read and Learn! 
<br /><br />Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke .
<br />Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions: 
<br />S * Ask the individual to SMILE. 
<br />T * Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) 
<br />(I.e. It is sunny out today) 
<br />R * Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS. 
<br /><br />NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue.. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other , that is also an indication of a stroke. 
<br /><br />If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call 911 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.

She didn't move, just sat with her head down staring at her hands. When I sat down beside her she didn't acknowledge my presence and the longer I sat I wondered if she was OK. Finally, not really wanting to disturb her but wanting to check on her at the same time, I asked her if she was OK. 
<br /><br />She raised her head and looked at me and smiled. &quot;Yes, I'm fine, thank you for asking,&quot; she said in a clear strong voice. 
<br /><br />&quot;I didn't mean to disturb you, Grandma, but you were just sitting here staring at your hands and I wanted to make sure you were OK,&quot; I explained to her. 
<br /><br />&quot;Have you ever looked at your hands?&quot; she asked. &quot;I mean really looked at your hands?&quot; I slowly opened my hands and stared down at them. I turned them over, palms up and then palms down. No, I guess I had never really looked at my hands as I tried to figure out the point she was making. 
<br /><br />Grandma smiled and related the following story: 
<br /><br />&quot;Stop and think for a moment about the hands you have, how they have served you well throughout your years. 
<br /><br />&quot;These hands, though wrinkled, shriveled and weak have been the tools I have used all my life to reach out and grab and embrace life. They braced and caught my fall when as a toddler I crashed upon the floor. They put food in my mouth and clothes on my back. As a child my mother taught me to fold them in prayer. They tied my shoes and pulled on my boots. 
<br /><br />&quot;They held my husband and wiped my tears when he went off t o war. They have been dirty, scraped and raw, swollen and bent.! 
<br /><br />&quot;They were uneasy and clumsy when I tried to hold my newborn son. Decorated with my wedding band they showed the world that I was married and loved someone special. 
<br /><br />&quot;They wrote my letters to him and trembled and shook when I buried my parents and spouse. They have held my children and grandchildren, consoled neighbors, and shook in fists of anger when I didn't understand. They have covered my face, combed my hair, and washed and cleansed the rest of my body. 
<br /><br />&quot;They have been sticky and wet, bent and broken, dried and raw. And to this day when not much of anything else of me works real well these hands hold me up, lay me down, and again continue to fold in prayer. 
<br /><br />&quot;These hands are the mark of where I've been and the ruggedness of life. But more importantly it will be these hands that God will reach out and take when he leads me home. And with my hands He will lift me to His side and there I will use these hands to touch the face of Christ.&quot; 
<br /><br />I will never look at my hands the same again. God reached out and took my grandma's hands and led her home. When my hands are hurt or sore or when I stroke the face of my children and husband I think of Grandma. I know she has been held by the hands of God. And I, too, want to touch the face of God and feel His hands upon my face.

<br /><br />Proud To Be White    
<br /><br />Someone finally said it.    
<br /><br />How many are actually paying attention to this?        
<br /><br />There are African  Americans,        
<br /><br />Mexican Americans,    
<br /><br />Asian Americans,    
<br /><br />Arab Americans,    
<br /><br />Native Americans, etc.    
<br /><br />....And then there are just-   
<br /><br />Americans.        
<br /><br />You pass me on the street    
<br /><br />and sneer in my direction.    
<br /><br />You Call me &quot;White boy,&quot;    
<br /><br />&quot;Cracker,&quot; &quot;Honkey,&quot;    
<br /><br />&quot;Whitey,&quot; &quot;Caveman,&quot;    
<br /><br />.... And that's OK.        
<br /><br />But when I call you Nigger,    
<br /><br />Kike, Towel head,    
<br /><br />Sand-nigger, Camel Jockey,    
<br /><br />Beaner, Gook, or Chink    
<br /><br />.... You call me a racist.        
<br /><br />You say that whites commit a lot    
<br /><br />of violence against you,    
<br /><br />so why are the ghettos the most    
<br /><br />dangerous places to live?        
<br /><br />You have the United   Negro College  Fund.    
<br /><br />You have Martin Luther King Day.    
<br /><br />You have Black History Month.    
<br /><br />You have Cesar Chavez Day.   
<br /><br />You have Ma'uled Al-Nabi.   
<br /><br />You Have Yom Hashoah.   
<br /><br />You have the NAACP.    
<br /><br />And you have BET.        
<br /><br />If we had WET    
<br /><br />(White Entertainment Television)    
<br /><br />.. We'd be racists.    
<br /><br />If we had a White Pride Day    
<br /><br />.... You would call us racists.    
<br /><br />If we had White History Month   
<br /><br />....We'd be racists.    
<br /><br />If we had any organization for only whites    
<br /><br />to &quot;advance&quot; OUR lives    
<br /><br />.... We'd be racists.    
<br /><br />We have a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,    
<br /><br />a Black Chamber of Commerce,    
<br /><br />and then we just have the plain    
<br /><br />Chamber of Commerce.    
<br /><br />Wonder who pays for that?    
<br /><br />If we had a college fund that only gave    
<br /><br />white students scholarships    
<br /><br />You know we'd be racists.   
<br /><br />There are over 60 openly-proclaimed    
<br /><br />Black-only Colleges in the US,   
<br /><br />yet if there were &quot;White-only Colleges&quot;    
<br /><br />THAT would be a racist college.    
<br /><br />In the Million Man March,    
<br /><br />you believed that you were    
<br /><br />marching for your race and rights.    
<br /><br />If we marched for our race and rights,    
<br /><br />.... You would call us racists.    
<br /><br />You are proud to be black,    
<br /><br />brown, yellow and orange,    
<br /><br />and you're not afraid to announce it.    
<br /><br />But when we announce our white pride    
<br /><br />.... You call us racists.    
<br /><br />You rob us,    
<br /><br />carjack us,    
<br /><br />and shoot at us.    
<br /><br />But, when a white police officer    
<br /><br />shoots a black gang member    
<br /><br />or beats up a black drug-dealer    
<br /><br />who is running from the LAW and    
<br /><br />posing a threat to ALL of society    
<br /><br />.... You call him a racist.    
<br /><br />I am proud.    
<br /><br />.... But, you call me a racist.    
<br /><br />Why is it that only    
<br /><br />whites    
<br /><br />can be racists?    
<br /><br />There is nothing improper about this  e-mail.    
<br /><br />Let's see which of you    
<br /><br />are proud enough to send it on.

<br /><br />After their baby was born, the panicked father went to see the
<br />obstetrician.
<br /><br />&quot;Doctor,&quot; the man said, &quot;I don't mind telling you, but I'm a little
<br />upset
<br />because my daughter has red hair. She can't possibly be mine.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Nonsense,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Even though you and your wife both have
<br />black
<br />hair, one of your ancestors may have contributed red hair to the gene
<br />pool.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;It isn't possible,&quot; the man insisted. &quot;This can't be, our families on
<br />both
<br />sides had jet-black hair for generations.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;let me ask you this. How often do you have
<br />sex?&quot;
<br /><br />The man seemed a bit ashamed. &quot;I've been working very hard for the past
<br />year.
<br />We only made love once or twice every few months.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, there you have it!&quot; The doctor said confidently. &quot;It's rust&quot;.

<br /><br />The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign around her neck. She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company. The sign reads, &quot;If you can catch me, you can have me.&quot;
<br /><br />Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later huffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 10 lbs. as promised.
<br /><br />He calls the company and orders their 5-day, 20 lb. program. The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life. She's wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, &quot;If you catch me you can have me.&quot;
<br /><br />Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape. Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 20 lbs. as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day, 50 lb. program
<br /><br />&quot;Are you sure?'&quot;asks the representative on the phone. &quot;This is our most rigorous program.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replies, &quot;I haven't felt this good in years.&quot;
<br /><br />The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, &quot;If I catch you, your ass is mine.&quot;
<br /><br />He lost 63 pounds that week.
