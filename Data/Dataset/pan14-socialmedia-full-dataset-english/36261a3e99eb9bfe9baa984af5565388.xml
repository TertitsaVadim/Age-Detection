<br />if you dress sexy, he says you're a slut
<br />If you argue with him, he says you're stubborn,
<br />If you're quiet, he says you're stupid
<br />If you call him, he says you're needy and clingy.
<br />If he calls you, he says you should be grateful
<br />If you don't love him, he'll try to win you
<br />If you love him, he'll leave you.
<br />If you don't fuck him, he'll say you don't love him,
<br />If you do, he'll say you're easy.
<br />If you tell him your problems, he'll say you're irritating,
<br />If you don't, he'll say you don't trust him.
<br />If you lecture him, he'll say you're bitchy,
<br />If he lectures you, it's because he 'cares for you'.
<br />If you break a promise, you can't be trusted,
<br />If he breaks it, he had to
<br />If you cheat, u expect it to be over
<br />If he cheats, he expects to be given another chance
<br />Either way.... you just never win

<br />Guy: No, this is fun.
<br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary!
<br />Guy: Then tell me you love me.
<br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down!
<br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
<br />Girl : *hugs him*
<br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me.
<br />Girl: Alright, now slow down
<br />Guy: I love you babe
<br />Girl: I love you too, please just slow down now! Please...
<br /><br />(in the paper the next day):
<br />A motorcycle had crashed into a building
<br />Because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived.
<br /><br />The truth was that halfway down the
<br />road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he
<br />didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say
<br />she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then
<br />he had her wear his helmet so that she would live
<br />even though it meant that he would die

<br /><br />You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value 
<br />of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper 
<br />may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to 
<br />the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! 
<br /><br />So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor 
<br />the sign on the door reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. 
<br /><br />She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 
<br /><br />&quot;That´s nice&quot;, she thinks, &quot;but I want more.&quot; 
<br />So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 
<br /><br />&quot;Wow,&quot; she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. 
<br />She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and 
<br />Help With Housework. 
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, mercy me!&quot; she exclaims, &quot;I can hardly stand it!&quot; 
<br />Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help 
<br />with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. 
<br /><br />She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads: 
<br /><br />Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on 
<br />this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible 
<br />to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. 
<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: 
<br /><br />To avoid gender bias charges, the store´s owner opened a New Wives store 
<br />just across the street. 
<br /><br />The first floor has wives that love sex. 
<br /><br />The second floor has wives that love sex and have money. 
<br /><br />The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited

<br /><br />A teacher asked her class, What do you want out of life?'
<br /><br />A little girl in the back row raised her hand and said, 'All I want out of life is four little animals.' 
<br /><br />The teacher asked, 'Really and what four little animals would that be sugar?
<br /><br />The little girl said, 'A mink on my back, a jaguar in the garage, a tiger in the bed and of course, I'll need a jackass to pay for all of it.'

<br />I remembered what you said. 
<br />You told me not to drink and drive, Mom, 
<br />So I drank sprite instead. 
<br />I felt really proud inside, Mom, 
<br />The way you said I would. 
<br />I didn't drink and drive, Mom, 
<br />Even though the others said I should. 
<br />I know I did the right thing, Mom, 
<br />I know you're always right. 
<br />Now the party is finally ending, Mom, 
<br />As everyone drives out of sight. 
<br />As I got into my car, Mom, 
<br />I knew I'd get home in one piece, 
<br />Because of the way you raised me, Mom, 
<br />So responsible and sweet. 
<br />I started to drive away, Mom, 
<br />But as I pulled onto the road, 
<br />The other car didn't see me, Mom, 
<br />And it hit me like a load. 
<br />As I lie here on the pavement, Mom, 
<br />I hear the policeman say, 
<br />The other guy is drunk, Mom, 
<br />And now I'm the one who'll pay. 
<br />I'm lying here dying, Mom, 
<br />I wish you'd get here soon. 
<br />How come this happened to me, Mom? 
<br />My life burst like a balloon. 
<br />There is blood all around me, Mom, 
<br />Most of it is mine. 
<br />I hear the paramedic say, Mom, 
<br />I'll be dead in a short time. 
<br />I just wanted to tell you, Mom, 
<br />I swear I didn't drink. 
<br />It was the others, Mom, 
<br />The others didn't think. 
<br />He didn't know where he was going, Mom, 
<br />He was probably at the same party as I. 
<br />The only difference is, Mom, 
<br />He drank, and I will die. 
<br />Why do people drink, Mom? 
<br />It can ruin your whole life. 
<br />I'm feeling sharp pains now, Mom, 
<br />Pains just like a knife. 
<br />The guy who hit me is walking, Mom, 
<br />I don't think it's fair. 
<br />I'm lying here dying, Mom, 
<br />While all he can do is stare. 
<br />Tell my brother not to cry, Mom, 
<br />Tell Daddy to be brave. 
<br />And when I get to heaven, Mom, 
<br />Write &quot;Daddy's Girl&quot; on my grave. 
<br />Someone should have told him, Mom, 
<br />Not to drink and drive. 
<br />If only they'd have take the time, Mom, 
<br />I would still be alive. 
<br />My breath is getting shorter, Mom, 
<br />I'm becoming very scared. 
<br />Please don't cry for me, Mom, 
<br />Because when I needed you, you were always there. 
<br />I have one last question, Mom, 
<br />Before I say good-bye. 
<br />I didn't ever drink, Mom, 
<br />So why am I to die? 
<br />This is the end, Mom, 
<br />I wish I could look you in the eye. 
<br />To say these final words, Mom, 
<br />I love you, and good-bye

<br /><br />A man walks into a drug store with his
<br /><br />8-year old son. They happen to walk by
<br /><br />The condom display, and the boy asks,
<br /><br />&quot;What are these, Dad?
<br /><br />To which the man matter-of-factly replies,
<br /><br />&quot;Those are called condoms, son. Men use
<br /><br />Them to have safe sex.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh I see,&quot; replied the boy pensively. Yes,
<br /><br />I've heard of that in health class at school.&quot;
<br /><br />He looks over the display and picks up a
<br /><br />Package of 3 and asks, &quot;Why are there 3
<br /><br />In this package?&quot;
<br /><br />The dad replies, &quot;Those are for high
<br /><br />School boys, ONE for Friday, ONE for
<br /><br />Saturday, and ONE for Sunday.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Cool&quot; says the boy. He notices a 6
<br /><br />Pack and asks, &quot;Then who are these
<br /><br />For?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Those are for college men,&quot; the dad
<br /><br />Answers, TWO for Friday, TWO for
<br /><br />Saturday, and TWO for Sunday.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;WOW!&quot; exclaimed the boy, &quot;then
<br /><br />Who uses THESE?&quot; he asks, picking
<br /><br />Up a 12 pack.
<br /><br />With a sigh and a tear in his eye,
<br /><br />The dad replied, &quot;Those are for married
<br /><br />Men. ONE for January, ONE for February,
<br /><br />ONE for March.....&quot;
<br /><br />1 for each month

<br /><br />When it was her turn to be served, and as she reached the cashier, she made a loud remark about the English Flag lapel pin, which the female cashier was wearing on her blouse.
<br /><br />The cashier reached up and touched the pin and said, &quot;Yes, I always wear it proudly. My son serves abroad with the forces and I wear it for him&quot;.
<br />The Muslim woman then asked the cashier when she was going to stop bombing and killing her countrymen, explaining that she was Iraqi.
<br />At that point, a gentleman standing in the queue stepped forward, and interrupted with a calm and gentle voice
<br />and said to the Iraqi woman:
<br />&quot;Excuse me, but hundreds of thousands of men and women, just like this ladies son have fought and sacrificed their lives so that people just like YOU can stand here, in England, which is MY country and allow you to blatantly accuse an innocent check-out cashier of bombing YOUR countrymen&quot;.
<br />&quot;It is my belief that if you were allowed to be as outspoken as that in Iraq, 
<br />, which you claim to be YOUR country, then we wouldn't need to be fighting there today&quot;.
<br />&quot;However - now that you have learned how to speak out and criticise the English people who have afforded you the protection of MY country, I will gladly pay the cost of a ticket to help you pay your way back to Iraq&quot;.
<br />&quot;When you get there, and if you manage to survive for being as outspoken as what you are here in England, then you should be able to help straighten out the mess which YOUR Iraqi countrymen have got you into in the first place, which appears to be the reason that you have come to MY country to avoid.&quot;
<br /><br />Apparently the queue cheered and applauded.
<br /><br />IF YOU AGREE... Pass this on to all of your proud English friends..
