<br />APPLIES
<br /><br />A little girl went to her bedroom and
<br />pulled a glass jelly jar from its hiding place
<br />in the closet.
<br /><br />She poured the change out on the floor
<br />and counted it carefully. Three
<br />times, even.. The total had to be exactly
<br />perfect.. No chance here for mistakes.
<br /><br />Carefully placing the coins back in the
<br />jar and twisting on the cap, she
<br />slipped out the back door and
<br />made her way 6 blocks to Rexall's Drug
<br />Store with the big red Indian Chief sign
<br />above the door.
<br />She waited patiently for the pharmacist
<br />to give her some attention, but he was
<br />too busy at this moment.
<br />Tess twisted her feet to make a
<br />scuffing noise. Nothing. She cleared her
<br />throat with the most disgusting sound
<br />she could muster. No good. Finally she took
<br />a quarter from her jar and banged it on
<br />the glass counter. That did it!
<br /><br />'And what do you want?' the
<br />pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone
<br />of voice.. I'm talking to my brother
<br />from Chicago whom I haven't seen in
<br />ages,' he said without waiting for a
<br />reply to his question..
<br /><br />'Well, I want to talk to you
<br />about my brother,' Tess answered
<br />back in the same annoyed tone.
<br />'He's really, really sick....and I want
<br />to buy a miracle.'
<br /><br />'I beg your pardon?' said the pharmacist.
<br /><br />'His name is Andrew and he has
<br />something bad growing inside his
<br />head and my Daddy says only a miracle
<br />can save him now. So how much does
<br />a miracle cost?'
<br /><br />'We don't sell miracles here, little girl.
<br />I'm sorry but I can't help you,' the
<br />pharmacist said, softening a little.
<br /><br />'Listen, I have the money to pay for it.
<br />If it isn't enough, I will get the rest.
<br />Just tell me how much it costs.'
<br /><br />The pharmacist's brother was a
<br />well dressed man. He stooped down
<br />and asked the little girl, 'What kind of a
<br />miracle does your brother need?'
<br /><br />'I don't know, 'Tess replied with her
<br />eyes welling up I just know he's really
<br />sick and Mommy says he needs an
<br />operation. But my Daddy can't pay for
<br />it, so I want to use my money..'
<br /><br />'How much do you have?' asked the
<br />man from Chicago .
<br /><br />'One dollar and eleven cents,'Tess
<br />answered barely audible.
<br /><br />'And it's all the money I have, but I
<br />can get some more if I need to.'
<br /><br />'Well, what a coincidence,' smiled the
<br />man. 'A dollar and eleven cents-the
<br />exact price of a miracle for little brothers.'
<br /><br />He took her money in one hand and with
<br />the other hand he grasped her mitten
<br />and said 'Take me to where you live.
<br />I want to see your brother and meet
<br />your parents. Let's see if I have the
<br />miracle you need.'
<br /><br />That well-dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, a surgeon, specializing in
<br />neuro-surgery.
<br />The operation was completed free of
<br />charge and it wasn't long until Andrew
<br />was home again and doing well.
<br /><br />Mom and Dad were happily talking about
<br />he chain of events that had led them to
<br />this place.
<br /><br />'That surgery,' her Mom whispered. 'was
<br />a real miracle. I wonder how much it would have cost?'
<br /><br />Tess smiled. She knew exactly how
<br />much a miracle cost.....one dollar and
<br />eleven cents...plus the faith of a little child.
<br /><br />In our lives, we never know how many
<br />miracles we will need.. A miracle is not
<br />the suspension of natural law, but
<br />the operation of a higher law.

<br />Love him or hate him , he sure hits the nail on the head with this!
<br />Bill Gates recently gave a speech at a High School about
<br />Eleven (11) things they did not and will not learn in school.
<br />He talks about how feel-good, politically correct teachings
<br />Created a generation of kids with no concept of reality and
<br />How this concept set them up for fail
<br />ure in the real world.
<br /><br />Rule 1 : Life is not fair - get used to it!
<br /><br />Rule 2 : The world doesn't care about your self-esteem.
<br />The world will expect you to accomplish something
<br />BEFORE you feel good about yourself.
<br /><br />Rule 3 : You will NOT make $60,000 a year right out of high school.
<br />You won't be a vice-president with a car phone until you earn both.
<br /><br />Rule 4 : If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss
<br /><br />Rule 5 : Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity.
<br />Your Grandparents had a different word for burger flipping:
<br />They called it opportunity.
<br /><br />Rule 6 : If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault,
<br />So don't whine about your mistakes, learn from them.
<br /><br />Rule 7 : Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring
<br />As they are now. They got that way from paying your bills,
<br />Cleaning your clothes and listening to you
<br />Talk about how cool you thought you were:
<br />So before you save the rain forest
<br />From the parasites of your parent's generation,
<br />Try delousing the closet in your own room..
<br /><br />Rule 8 : Your school may have done away with winners and losers,
<br />But life HAS NOT. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades
<br />And they'll give you as MANY TIMES as you want to get the right answer.
<br />*This doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.
<br /><br />Rule 9 : Life is not divided into semesters.
<br />You don't get summers off and very few employers
<br />Are interested in helping you FIND YOURSELF.
<br />*Do that on your own time.
<br /><br />Rule 10 : Television is NOT real life.
<br />In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.
<br /><br />Rule 11 : Be nice to nerds.
<br />Chances are you'll end up working for one..
<br />If you can read this... Thank a Teacher.
<br />If you can read this in English... Thank a Soldier!
<br />And for life and everything else you have... Thank God!!
<br />Now.... Think about this and smile if you agree and please pass this on...
<br />If you don't agree, go stick your head in the sand and take a deep breath!

<br /><br />Why? Because in addition to being in slow-growth economies, saddled with debilitating debts, they’re the victims of an enormous increase in money supply.
<br /><br />Result? Serious inflation and devaluation for both currencies in the coming years.
<br /><br />Even if the United States doesn’t add to its already bloated debt, the interest on it – coupled with massive money printing – virtually guarantees higher prices. The same goes for Europe, as the region is printing money out of thin air to bail out its ailing countries and banks.
<br /><br />However, the dollar and euro’s pain could easily be your gain.
<br /><br />You see, the situation is rapidly creating a new currency world order. Specifically, three currencies are poised for a massive upward revaluation…
<br /><br />The Three “Super Currencies” of Tomorrow
<br /><br />There’s a trio of currencies that you must include in your portfolio today.
<br /><br />Backed by solid fundamentals in countries that rely on growth, not artificial monetary stimulation, these three currencies operate on an entirely different playing field to the dollar and euro.
<br /><br />And they’re set to undergo huge revaluations in the coming years. Let me show you why. First up…
<br /><br />~ Currency #1 – Chinese Yuan:
<br /><br />As the dollar and euro decline, the Chinese are busy plowing the yuan into assets that increase in value. Things like mines, factories, other currencies and natural resources.
<br /><br />At current levels, the yuan is a bargain. Of course, the Chinese government deliberately sets the exchange rate artificially low – rather than allowing it to float freely on world markets – in order to profit from Chinese goods and services.
<br /><br />With the world balking at this arrangement, the Chinese will have to revalue the yuan in a big way over coming years. Why? Two reasons…
<br /><br />The Chinese aren’t just goods producers these days… they’re big consumers, too. This means reduced dollar reserves and more yuan will be invested abroad.
<br />    The Chinese will be forced to revalue the yuan more frequently and by greater amounts – something the country was unable to do as it was busy accumulating dollars.
<br /><br />As a tandem, these two catalysts will force the value of the yuan higher in the years ahead.
<br /><br />Where to Invest: The FOREX market is fraught with volatility and requires a special currency-trading account to facilitate trades. So in lieu of that, take advantage through the WisdomTree Chinese Yuan ETF (NYSE: CY<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />, which trades like a stock. Hold for the long term – two to five years – and look for 20% upside against the U.S. dollar in five years.
<br /><br />~ Currency #2 – Indian Rupee:
<br /><br />Having dropped by more than 20% against the dollar over the past couple of years, the rupee is an absolute steal right now.
<br /><br />The Indian Central Bank controls the rupee closely. And in an effort to combat the financial crisis and make Indian goods and services more competitive, it’s allowed the currency to depreciate.
<br /><br />Result? An artificially weak rupee that will appreciate, due to the trend in global growth and money flow.
<br /><br />With Indian GDP growth set to outstrip all Western economies in the years ahead, the country will have to raise interest rates to quell inflation.
<br /><br />In the past, this wasn’t an issue, since India wasn’t a global player when it came to importing goods and services. It was a closed, insulated economy, where the majority of the population bought locally.
<br /><br />But with the Indian middle class approaching some 400 million people, the country is beginning to import more goods. That will lead to inflation, which will force the central bank to tighten monetary policy.
<br /><br />Where to Invest: You can buy the Indian rupee through the WisdomTree Indian Rupee ETF(NYSE: ICN). Again, plan to hold for two to five years. I project 25% growth against the U.S. dollar in five years.
<br /><br />Finally, another currency that stands to gain from the demise of the dollar and euro…
<br /><br />~ Currency #3 – Canadian Dollar:
<br /><br />The Canadian dollar has a bright future.
<br /><br />For starters, Canada is rich in natural resources like oil, timber and gold. As the prospects for global growth pick up, all three are in huge demand from developed and developing economies alike – a trend that will remain for years.
<br /><br />Canada also has its fiscal house in good order. Its AAA credit rating is secure, as the country quickly tackled its debt issues in the early part of this century. As a result, the Canadian dollar has almost doubled against its U.S. counterpart in the past decade.
<br /><br />In addition, Canada didn’t have to bail out its banks or financial system because of lax lending practices. Quite the opposite, in fact. Thanks to their financial strength, Canadian banks are now expanding into the United States in record numbers.
<br /><br />In short, Canada has a lot going for it. It supplies emerging markets… it has a strong and fiscally responsible financial system and government… it will benefit from a U.S. economic recovery… and it maintains a transparent and trusted economy.
<br /><br />Where to Invest: Add the “loonie” to your portfolio through the CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXC). Like the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee, this is a long-term holding, with a further 25% gain against the U.S. dollar in five years.
<br /><br />Bottom line: Remember that we’re talking currencies here, so a move of 10% to 15% would be huge. But these three will represent the new world order in the currency market over the coming years – and the gains will reflect that.
<br /><br />The best way to buy the yuan, rupee and Canadian dollar is to make regular investments over time. Don’t just pile in at once. Average your cost over the next few months as the U.S. economy strengthens. This strategy will allow you to buy the currencies at reasonable levels.

		<document id="13fc7da03530c0927e62812e101be9e0" url=""><![CDATA[Family ....<br/><br/>Hazrat Sa'd ibne Abi Waqqas narrated:
<br />Allah's Apostle (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:
<br />&quot;You will be rewarded for whatever you spend for Allah's sake even if it were a morsel which you put in your wife's mouth.&quot; (Bukhari)
<br /><br />Explanation: Spending on family and taking full care of them with the intention to only please Allah (swt) and to have reward from Allah is of a great reward.
<br />Hence, every one ought to fulfill their requirement and spend on his family as per his capability and ought not to be miser for them.
<br />It is also narrated by Abu Mas'ud (ra) that the Prophet of Allah (saws) said,
<br />&quot;If a man spends on his family (with the intention of having a reward from Allah) sincerely for Allah's sake then it is a (kind of) alms-giving in reward for him.&quot;
<br />Question: If someone committed a sin and repented and asked Allah for forgiveness and made firm intention not to repeat. Then sadly he repeated.
<br />Will Allah forgive him if he repent again?
<br /><br />Answer: Allah says: 'Do not despair. Verily Allah will forgive all sins.' The only sin that is unforgivable is Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (ascribing partners). You should renew your Tawbah and again make a firm intention never to repeat the sin. For Allah is Most Forgiving.
<br />(And Allah knows the best)

You were born from a drop of dirty sperm. Thereafter you passed through many phases of your life until you have reached this position. Daily you expel urine and stool from your body. Also think of your condition after your death. The worms of the grave will consume your entire body. Can such a person still have pride?It is mentioned in a Hadi
<br />th that a person who has a miniscule of pride will never enter Jannah. Takabbur means to regard yourself as great and to look down at others. The cure for this is to ponder over death before sleeping. Think that it is your last night in this world. Do you have any rights of people that are not fulfilled? Is there anyone who you have hurt in any way and have not yet asked them for forgiveness? Then imagine the malaaikah taking control of your life. They are about to snatch it away. Commence reciting the kalimah as though you are preparing for your last moments. (In this way you will be cured from pride).

<br />A BIT LONG BUT DEFINITELY WORTH A READ--
<br /><br />Written by a doctor who suffers from cancer and he uses alternative rather than conventional medicine that involves chemo etc. 
<br /><br />Good to share with family and friends. 
<br /><br />Subject: Cancer treatment is about making money...provoking thoughts 
<br /><br />I posted this article, which may have some provoking thoughts:
<br /><br />The below is absolutely 100% true and as a doctor I have been telling people this for 15 years now. No one wants to listen. Folks need to wake up. Cancer treatment is about making money. It is a 120 billion dollar a year industry in the United States alone and estimated to be a 600 billion dollar a year industry worldwide. 
<br /><br />A successful cancer case according to the American Cancer Society and the American College of Oncology and Hematology means that the person survives for 5 years. Both the American Cancer Society and the American College of Oncology and Hematology admit that a person is likely to survive cancer for 7 to 10 years even if they do absolutely NOTHING. Of course, only the doctors get those magazines - not you, the cancer patient.
<br /><br />Alternative medicine's track record of curing cancer is 10 times higher than that of conventional medicine. Note that I say CURE.
<br /><br />Remember another thing. A TUMOR is just a symptom. It is not the cause of cancer. 
<br /><br />Science is cause and effect. Remove the cause and the effect disappears.
<br /><br />I am in my third battle with cancer right now. I have not done any chemotherapy or radiation or surgery for any of my bouts with cancer. I survived leukemia, I survived Non Hodgkins Lymphoma and now I have Glioblastoma which is supposedly an incurable form of brain cancer. I was given two months to live 5 months ago. 
<br /><br />I have been using Chinese herbs, high doses of vitamin C, acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy and nutritional changes. Yes, at first it got worse. It had metastasized to my lymph nodes, my lungs and my bones. As of this week, I am happy to say that there is no evidence now of any cancer in my lymph system or my bones. I had 6 tumors in my lungs, now there are only two. The tumors in my brain have shrunken tremendously. I never did any of their chemo, radiation or surgery. 
<br /><br />Here is a very interesting statistic that you can only have access to by being a doctor.Every year more than 1,000 doctors oncologists (cancer doctors) are diagnosed with cancer. Less than 10% of them choose to do the treatment that they have been giving to their patients. Sort of like the fact that less than 25% of all pediatricians vaccinate their own children because of the fact that the risk of sudden death or serious side effects from the vaccination is higher than the risk of catching the disease one is being vaccinated for. This is not bullshit people - it is truth. 
<br /><br />Medicine is about money, not about your health and the system traps people, especially the elderly, disabled and poor into a deadly treatment regime that puts them in an early grave. Meanwhile, all the jet set billionaires are flying off to Europe and paying big bucks for alternative treatments and getting cured.
<br /><br />Does alternative medicine work all the time? No. Of course not. Nothing works all the time. But there is a reason for that. You don't die until it's your time to die. Nothing can make you live longer than that time. 
<br /><br />However quality of life comes into play. Those cancer patients who use alternative therapies for their cancer, yet still die from the illness, suffer a much higher quality of life. They die able to spend time with their families and even recognize their family members. They don't become emaciated like those who do chemotherapy or radiation do and rarely is a person who goes under the treatment of chemotherapy able to recognize anyone for the last few days of their lives. Their bodies become ravaged to the point that you can't even recognize them either. They suffer at a much much higher rate and they have one let down after another as doctors tell them, ahhh - it's looking good, only to tell them on the next visit it's looking worse, you need more chemo and radiation.
<br /><br />What is criminal about this is that YOUR DOCTORS KNOW THIS SHIT. 
<br /><br />I took an oath as a physician. I have always followed it. That has certainly not made me successful financially as a doctor because I have consistently refused to go along with conventional medicine's bullshit.
<br /><br />Read the below carefully. It may indeed make a difference in your life.
<br />THIS IS AMAZING INFORMATION WHAT FEEDS CANCER, AND WHAT OTHER TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE. PLEASE READ AND PASS ON TO YOUR LOVED ONES. 
<br /><br />This HAS to be of interest to everyone... FINALLY!!! News from the medical world that makes sense!!! 
<br /><br />Johns Hopkins Update –
<br />This is an extremely good article.
<br /><br />Everyone should read it. 
<br />AFTER YEARS OF TELLING PEOPLE CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRY ('TRY', BEING THE KEY WORD) TO ELIMINATE CANCER, JOHNS HOPKINS IS FINALLY STARTING TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY . 
<br /><br />Cancer Update from Johns Hopkins: 
<br /><br />1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer 
<br />cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have
<br />multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients
<br />that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after 
<br />treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the
<br />cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable
<br />size. 
<br /><br />2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a 
<br />person's lifetime. 
<br /><br />3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer 
<br />cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and
<br />forming tumors. 
<br /><br />4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has
<br />nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic,
<br />but also to environmental, food and lifestyle factors. 
<br /><br />5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing
<br />diet to eat more adequately and healthy, 4-5 times/day 
<br />and by including supplements will strengthen the immune system. 
<br /><br />6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing
<br />cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells
<br />in the bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract etc, and can 
<br />cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc. 
<br /><br />7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars 
<br />and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs. 
<br /><br />8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often
<br />reduce tumor size.
<br />However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction. 
<br /><br />9. When the body has too much toxic burden from
<br />chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either
<br />compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb
<br />to various kinds of infections and complications. 
<br /><br />10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to
<br />mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy.
<br />Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.
<br /><br />11. An effective way to battle cancer is to starve the cancer
<br />cells by not feeding it with the foods it needs to multiply. 
<br /><br />*CANCER CELLS FEED ON: 
<br /><br />a. Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc are made
<br />with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute
<br />would be Manuka honey or molasses, but only in very small
<br />amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in
<br />color Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt. 
<br /><br />b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the
<br />gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soy milk cancer cells are being starved. 
<br /><br />c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based
<br />diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little other meat, 
<br />like chicken. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer. 
<br /><br />d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole
<br />grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into
<br />an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked
<br />food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live
<br />enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to
<br />cellular levels within 15 minutes to nourish and enhance
<br />growth of healthy cells. To obtain live enzymes for building
<br />healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most
<br />vegetables including be an sprouts) and eat some raw
<br />vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at
<br />temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).. 
<br /><br />e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high
<br />caffeine Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer
<br />fighting properties. Water-best to drink purified water, or
<br />filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap
<br />water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it. 
<br /><br />12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of
<br />digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the
<br />intestines becomes putrefied and leads to more toxic buildup. 
<br /><br />13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By
<br />refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes
<br />to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the
<br />body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells. 
<br /><br />14. Some supplements build up the immune system
<br />(IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals,
<br />EFAs etc.) to enable the bodies own killer cells to destroy
<br />cancer cells.. Other supplements like vitamin E are known
<br />to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's
<br />normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or
<br />unneeded cells. 
<br /><br />15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit.
<br /><br />A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior
<br />be a survivor. Anger, un-forgiveness and bitterness put
<br />the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to
<br />have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.
<br /><br />16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated
<br />environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to
<br />get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells. 
<br /><br />1. No plastic containers in micro. 
<br /><br />2. No water bottles in freezer. 
<br /><br />3. No plastic wrap in microwave.. 
<br /><br />Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in its newsletters. This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as well. Dioxin chemicals cause cancer, especially breast cancer. Dioxins are highly poisonous to the cells of our bodies. Don't freeze your plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic. Recently, Dr Edward Fujimoto, Wellness Program Manager at Castle Hospital , was on a TV program to explain this health hazard. He talked about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers. This especially applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of fat, high heat, and plastics releases dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Instead, he recommends using glass, such as Corning Ware, Pyrex or ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results, only without the dioxin. So such things as TV dinners, instant ramen and soups, etc., should be removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. It's just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc. He reminded us that a while ago some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper The dioxin problem is one of the reasons. 
<br /><br />Please share this with your whole email list......................... 
<br />Also, he pointed out that plastic wrap, such as Saran, is just as dangerous when placed over foods to be cooked in the microwave. As the food is nuked, the high heat causes poisonous toxins to actually melt out of the plastic wrap and drip into the food. Cover food with a paper towel instead. 
<br />This is an article that should be sent to anyone important in your life...
