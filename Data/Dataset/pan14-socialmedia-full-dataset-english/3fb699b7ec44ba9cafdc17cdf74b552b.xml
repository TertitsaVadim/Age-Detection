<br /><br />A few hours later, the babysitter was calling to ask if she could cover up the clown statue in the kids' room, the father said,&quot;Take the kids and get out of the house. We'll call the police, we don't have a clown statue.&quot;
<br /><br />The &quot;clown statue&quot; is really a killer that escaped from jail.
<br /><br />If you don't post this blog to 10 other people tonight, the clown will be in your bed at 3:00 am (and not bed as in sex, hell actually kill you)

		<document id="ef652ea72f26af82a0aebb8eb727e1d6" url=""><![CDATA[may your day be a shay day<br/><br/>OK, I got sent this and think it makes a very serious point about the jokes that we all forward to each other and have a laugh an joke at. This made my mum cry so just take something seriously for once people and don´t make a jokes about it.
<br /><br />its long but please take ya a moment to read it.
<br /><br />Thanks.
<br /><br />What would you do?....you make the choice. Don´t look for a punch line, there isn´t one. Read it anyway. My question is: Would you have made the same choice?
<br /><br />At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children, the father of one of the students
<br />delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question: &quot;When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do. Where is the natural order of things in my son?&quot;
<br /><br />The audience was stilled by the query.
<br /><br />The father continued. &quot;I believe that when a child like Shay, physically and mentally handicapped comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.&quot;
<br /><br />Then he told the following story:
<br /><br />Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, &quot;Do you think they´ll let me play?&quot; Shay´s father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.
<br /><br />Shay´s father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, &quot;We´re losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we´ll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.&quot;
<br /><br />Shay struggled over to the team´s bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye and warmth in his heart. The boys saw the father´s joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay´s team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously
<br />ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay´s team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.
<br /><br />At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn´t even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.
<br /><br />However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay´s life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.
<br /><br />The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.
<br /><br />Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman´s head, out of reach of all team mates. Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, &quot;Shay, run to first! Run to first!&quot; Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.
<br /><br />Everyone yelled, &quot;Run to second, run to second!&quot; Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball ... the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team. He
<br />could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher´s intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman´s head. Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.
<br /><br />All were screaming, &quot;Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay&quot;
<br /><br />Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, &quot;Run to third! Shay, run to third!&quot;
<br /><br />As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, &quot;Shay, run home! Run home!&quot; Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team.
<br /><br />&quot;That day&quot;, said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, &quot;the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world&quot;.
<br /><br />Shay didn´t make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy, and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!
<br /><br />AND NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY: We all send thousands of jokes through the email without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and work places.
<br /><br />If you´re thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you´re probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren´t the &quot;appropriate&quot; ones to receive this type of message.
<br /><br />Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference. We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the &quot;natural order of things.&quot; So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice: Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?
<br /><br />A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it´s least fortunate amongst them.
<br /><br />You now have two choices:
<br /><br />1. Delete
<br />2. Forward
<br /><br />May your day, be a Shay Day

<br />near the 
<br />end of his 
<br />senior 
<br />year in high school. 
<br />Unfortunately, 
<br />he still has to share a room with his 
<br />younger 
<br />brother who is only 9 
<br />years 
<br />old. 
<br /><br />One night, he decides to bring his 
<br />girlfriend home 
<br />for a little fun. 
<br />They 
<br />have bunk beds and the guy notices that 
<br />his little 
<br />brother is already 
<br />asleep 
<br />on the lower bunk, so he and his 
<br />girlfriend climb 
<br />up 
<br />to the top bunk. 
<br /><br />As you 
<br />might expect things start to heat up. 
<br />The guy remembers that his little brother 
<br />is 
<br />sleeping below so he tells 
<br />his 
<br />girlfriend to whisper &quot;lettuce&quot; if she wants 
<br />it 
<br />harder and &quot;tomato&quot; if 
<br />she 
<br />wants a new position. 
<br /><br />Lettuce!!!

<br /><br />Whoa!!! 
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT!!! 
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT NOW!!! 
<br /><br />I can't get pregnant! 
<br /><br />Then the little brother shouts up, &quot;Hey,

<br /><br />ITS 7TH GRADE... 
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called 'best friend'... I 
<br />stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she 
<br />didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me 
<br />and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed 
<br />them to her... She said 'thanks'... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I 
<br />wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be 'just 
<br />friends'... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know 
<br />why... 
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR... 
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling 
<br />on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come 
<br />over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her 
<br />on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 
<br />hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go 
<br />to sleep... She looked at me.. Said 'thanks' and gave me a kiss on the 
<br />cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to 
<br />be 'just friends'... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't 
<br />know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR... 
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... 'My date is sick' she 
<br />said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th 
<br />grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go 
<br />together just as 'best friends'... And so we did... 
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT... 
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I 
<br />stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she 
<br />doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said 'I had the 
<br />best time... Thanks!'... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to 
<br />tell her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be 'just friends'... I 
<br />love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY... 
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could 
<br />blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated 
<br />like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... 
<br />But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone 
<br />went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged 
<br />her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said 'you're my best 
<br />friend'... 'Thanks!'... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell 
<br />her.. I wanted her to know that I wanted to be more than 'just friends'... I 
<br />love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER... 
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married 
<br />in now... I watched her say 'I do' an drive off to her new life... Married 
<br />to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like 
<br />that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and 
<br />said 'You came!... Thanks!'... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to 
<br />tell her... I wanted her to know that I didn't want to be 'just friends'... I 
<br />love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED... 
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my 'best friend'... At 
<br />the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school 
<br />years... This is what it said... 'I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... 
<br />But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell 
<br />him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be 'just friends'... I 
<br />love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would 
<br />tell me he loved me'... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I 
<br />cried...
