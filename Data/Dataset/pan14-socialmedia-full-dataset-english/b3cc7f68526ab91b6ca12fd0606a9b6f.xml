This low quality content often left a signature as it was stuffed with the same keywords over and over. For example, phrases like, &quot;Keyword phrase is a good thing&quot; were actually much more common than they should have been. LSI related keywords are much more typical in regular writing created for real users. For example, this article on SEO also mentions links, content, page rank, Google, and backlinks. These are just the kind of LSI related keywords that would be present in an article written for a real human being.<br /><br />3. &lt;u&gt;Backlink Quality Over Quantity All Day Long&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Google had to do something to ignore the influx of spammy link-building tools that are all essentially designed to cheat Google's algorithm.

Unfortunately, this aspect of Google's search is often skipped to just skip straight to backlinks without increasing the user experience to get those backlinks.<br /><br /><strong>So what makes a quality backlink?</strong><br /><br />The ideal backlinks possesses all of the following characteristics:<br /><br />??

Google and many other search engines need to be able to trust your website, and that is where page rank comes into play. The more page rank your website has coming to it from trusted links, the more your website will be trusted by the search engines and your rank will start to improve.

Better invest it into more content and more backlinks. You can get quality backlinks for thousands of dollars for free. This is absolutely realistic and others started to do this.<br /><br />If you ever had an issue with coming up with press releases or you don't know how to do it properly, then this article is going to show you how and the right way to do it to get permanent traffic and backlinks. I will be talking about a powerful 6 step strategy to creating effective press releases.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 1: Your Headline&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Firstly, your press release must contain a headline that is both keyword rich and compelling. If you need ideas for keywords, you can use the Google keyword tool. The best keywords to use would be long tail keywords because they are easier to rank in the search engines.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 2: Announce Something&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Do not try to over-sell anything in your body text, PR sites do not like that. Remember, these sites are pretty much like news sites and they are looking for juicy information that can help get their own sites more views. So give them what they want and actually provide something newsworthy by announcing something. This can be a form of a &quot;revolutionary new treatment&quot;,&quot;underground traffic method&quot; or something like that.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 3: What's in it for them?&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Also remember to list the benefits of the site (or product) to entice people to visit your website. Generally, the benefits of a product can be found either on its sales page or the product description. Fill the reader up with them and get them more interested in the thing you are offering.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 4: Testimonials&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This would be dependent on the merchant you are promoting, but if they provide proof or testimonials, you should include them in the copy of your PR to help increase credibility and bonding with your prospect. However, don't go over board and just pepper your release with testimonial after testimonial.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 5: Call To Action&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This is one of the most important aspects of your press release. You should make certain to include a strong call to action for your prospect after they read your entire copy. Reiterate the benefits they can get if they visit your site, specifically tell them what to do next. Some people drop the ball on this component purely because they are afraid to ask. Make sure you are not one of them!<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Step 6: Contact Info&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Finally, you should include your contact info in the press release too. This will help make it look more professional and you would appear to be a more trustworthy individual.<br /><br />This article covered the six steps to creating powerful press releases that will help you get approved by the PR sites more easily. Some times it is a pain to get them approved but the tips mentioned above should help you much. By the way, I have a free press release software that I can share with you, just visit the site mentioned below, get my contact details, drop me an email and I will send you the link to the software instantly.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy8zMTI1NDktSG93LVRvLVdyaXRlLUEtUHJlc3MtUmVsZWFzZS1BbmQtR2V0LVBlcm1hbmVudC1UcmFmZmljLUFuZC1CYWNrbGlua3MuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Thorough Insights About get backlinks In Note By Note Order</a>

If you are a business owner or an Online Affiliate Business Owner having Search Engine Optimization skills will go a long way to your success Online. There are a couple choices I want to mention in this article.<br /><br />Do the SEO yourself. Start by making sure your On page optimization is set up properly going after the keywords you want to target. All meta tag coding should be structured so that it reflects the main theme or keywords and match the content on each page. You will have to build links that point back to your site as well once that is done. Good back links are widely considered the most important factor in why websites rank well Online.<br /><br />Or you can pay a SEO company to set up this for you. But paying a SEO company can be quite expensive. SEO is not rocket science so if you can take the time to learn it you will save your company thousands of dollars in monthly expenses.<br /><br />Ways to get Links:<br /><br /><strong>Write Articles</strong>. This is the old faithful way to get back links to your site. You simply submit articles to article directories like EzineArticles, Goarticles, or Article Dashboard. Some directories allow links within the body text and others do not. All will have a resource box where you will place your links in however. There are two strategies for article writing I will mention.<br /><br />One. Write the articles on your favorite topics or directly related to your niche, and place links within the body text where you are allowed, as well as the resource box. Or write articles without any body text links but write them in popular categories hoping webmasters will come along and pick up your articles. When this happens you have potential to have your articles placed on hundreds of websites giving you the possibility for hundreds of back links. In either case you can pay freelance writers to write your articles for you. Often you can find a good article writer 3-5 dollars per article freeing up your time.<br /><br /><strong>Directories</strong>.

This trusted way to get back links takes some time since most directories take weeks before approved. But this is something you should do because these links stick, and your website will benefit from page rank flowing back to your website.<br /><br /><strong>Web 2.0 Websites</strong>. This is a very popular way to get back links by taking advantage of the existing authority of websites that Google loves. Web 2.0 sites such as Squidoo, Hubpages and Vox are effective but there are literally dozens and dozens of these websites. Same strategy applies with writing articles, but you can place your body text links anywhere you want linking back to your website for linking power.<br /><br /><strong>Links from similar places as your competitors</strong>. Get links from the same place your competitors get them. An easy way to do this is to download a tool like SEO for Firefox. Use this tool when doing a search in Google. It will allow you to discover where all your competitors get many of their links. Go through the list and see if you can get some of the same ones they have.<br /><br />My personal favorite way to get back links is <strong>getting articles placed on niche related blogs</strong>. This is one way I have found that is super effective. With time, your site can be a top listed site on many search engines.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy8zMTI1NDktSG93LVRvLVdyaXRlLUEtUHJlc3MtUmVsZWFzZS1BbmQtR2V0LVBlcm1hbmVudC1UcmFmZmljLUFuZC1CYWNrbGlua3MuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">In Depth Notes On The get backlinks In Grade By Grade Order</a>

Fresh dofollow quality backlinks are adored by the search engines if they stay up long enough and will improve the quality of your SERP rank as well. Link building services often ignore the importance of Gov and Edu backlinks because they are somewhat more elusive. They opt instead for social bookmarking tools and the lower quality backlinks than come from spamming comment sites. These backlinks don't remain active for long as admin usually deletes them so you can see your site rise in rank and drop again just as quickly.<br /><br />Making sure that gaining edu backlinks is a part of your link building strategy is highly recommended. Again, the more trust and authority and association with high quality established sites, the more the search engines will reward you. New content will be indexed faster and so you'll keep your rank more easily.<br /><br />You can buy a backlink pack with several hundred backlinks already included and this is a good thing to do if you are so inclined. You can also buy packs for Edu backlinks and while they'll contain fewer links, you simply don't need as many considering how highly regarded Edu backlinks are with the search engines. The whole process of off page SEO consists of more than just the number of links to your site. For a while, having too many links in too short a time actually meant that a site would be relegated to the back pages of Google since the concept was being abused.<br /><br />It is easy to understand why backlinks are important; it is no different from social proof in traditional marketing. Think of this... if Harvard University uses a certain text book in its courses, then you can guarantee that the author would have more people interested in him. edu backlinks are the online equivalent of this exact scenario.<br /><br />To website owners, edu backlinks are the pinnacle of professionalism and link building. To get edu backlinks is to finally locate the holy grail. There is no use having a well designed website with informative content if your site do not show up in the first few pages of a search engine result. When it comes to Google, where most people go to search the Internet, having other sites linking back to your site (backlinks) is one of the sure fire ways to increase your page rank and visibility in search engines. It is important to appear on the first page because the vast majority of people do not search past the first page.<br /><br />When you get Edu backlinks, you will eventually increase your website page rank. Google gives authoritative pages or sites high page rank and if they link back to your site, your page rank increases as well. With a higher page rank, your website tends to appear higher in the search engine results page (SERP). What Google deems authoritative are pages with informative, verified content which actually help users who search for related phrases or keywords. Some of these authoritative sites are those with.gov or.edu. They are run by government establishments or universities and tend to be more professional most other sites.

In simple terms, social marketing is like using word of mouth on a very grand scale. It provides an excellent top of funnel platform for attracting new clients directly and indirectly. It can turn friends, prospects, and customers into your best sales staff.<br /><br />Most business owners and managers are familiar with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media sites. Most are also familiar with the goal to get fans, likes, shares, follows, retweets, and etc. The trick is knowing just how to implement a strategy to obtain the goal. Social marketing is not just an extension of traditional advertising and marketing or a website.<br /><br />Social marketing is a vast opportunity for interactivity and takes advantage of the natural motivation of people for sharing and reciprocity. The interactivity of the visitor naturally turns them into sales and lead generation referral partners. As opposed to pushing out traditional sales-hype driven content this new marketing channel allows a company to interact with the visitor and leverage the interaction to dramatically increase brand awareness, lead generation, and sales.<br /><br />In addition to the more common techniques used to grow fans, friends, followers, and etc. (to be covered later) a higher converting method of using Social Marketing is a referral program. A smart referral program can short cut the funnel time cycle and create pre-qualified leads along with additional advocates for your brand.<br /><br />Ideally a referral program works in conjunction with your social media sites as well as your other online properties. Any web page, landing or sales page, or even a Facebook tab can be used in the process. Take a look at the offer image to the left. See the &quot;Invite Friends, Get $10&quot;? This link, when clicked, asks the visitor to enter an email address. It could also drive them to a Facebook tab page where the visitor will &quot;like&quot; the page and receive an offer. This offer then provides the visitor with an opportunity to receive an additional reward for sending a reward link to a friend. Here is a sample post that an interested visitor might use.<br /><br />&quot;I love my new XYZ software. Here is a link to see it for yourself and to get 20% off! domain.com X466C677 &quot;<br /><br />A referral campaign should always be used in a funnel. A popular funnel is one that starts with a website visitor originating from a referral, SEO, social marketing, or other traffic generation technique. The visitor or customer is then prompted to visit a social marketing site. The social site contains a link or page for a referral offer. This technique is popular as it contains several funnel entry points throughout the process.<br /><br />Depending on whether you're a B2B, B2C, Ecommerce, or other form of online company, you'll want to test offers and sharing channels to get the best results. Email should always be included in the funnel. All companies should also include Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and if your B2B LinkedIn. Try to keep the number of channels in the stream to under 4.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTkyNzU0MC9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Finely Detailed Ideas About get backlinks In Bit By Bit Order</a>The term social marketing refers to the practice of using conventional marketing tools to alter human behavior in the direction of some social good, rather than as a means of increasing corporate profits.

In simple terms, social marketing is like using word of mouth on a very grand scale. It provides an excellent top of funnel platform for attracting new clients directly and indirectly.

Most are also familiar with the goal to get fans, likes, shares, follows, retweets, and etc. The trick is knowing just how to implement a strategy to obtain the goal. Social marketing is not just an extension of traditional advertising and marketing or a website.<br /><br />Social marketing is a vast opportunity for interactivity and takes advantage of the natural motivation of people for sharing and reciprocity. The interactivity of the visitor naturally turns them into sales and lead generation referral partners. As opposed to pushing out traditional sales-hype driven content this new marketing channel allows a company to interact with the visitor and leverage the interaction to dramatically increase brand awareness, lead generation, and sales.<br /><br />In addition to the more common techniques used to grow fans, friends, followers, and etc. (to be covered later) a higher converting method of using Social Marketing is a referral program.

Any web page, landing or sales page, or even a Facebook tab can be used in the process. Take a look at the offer image to the left. See the &quot;Invite Friends, Get $10&quot;? This link, when clicked, asks the visitor to enter an email address. It could also drive them to a Facebook tab page where the visitor will &quot;like&quot; the page and receive an offer. This offer then provides the visitor with an opportunity to receive an additional reward for sending a reward link to a friend.

Backlinks are one of these techniques; they have become building blocks for SEO for a few reasons. A backlink is a link on another website, article, newsletter or blog, etc. that leads back to your website, article, etc. Learning how to get backlinks is something that can be done by you for no cost. It will take a bit of your time though. You will have to become a member of networking sites and newsletters and even start a blog. You can post links on these networking sites that link to your website or article.<br /><br />The reason you want to get backlinks is because it is a great way for your website to get ranked, especially in Google. The way search engines rate your website, articles or blogs is based on quality and popularity. <strong>Quality</strong>: the linking text must be the same as the site, the link must go to a relevant site, backlinks placed on authoritative websites are very valuable and the backlink is considered valuable and relevant and has a strong influence on the search engine ranking. <strong>Popularity</strong>: simply put, link popularity is a measurement of the total amount of links coming into your site.<br /><br />When you learn how to get backlinks you will learn how to make them of good quality and relevant content. The search engines will use algorithms that compare the word content and decide if the sites are related. For example if you have a post about 'fly fishing' on Digg.com and it links to your article on 'bird watching' you will not get a rating from Google because the two are not related at all. Another small technique to use when linking to your website or article is to make your linking text the same as you keywords. The reason is because you keyword will obviously be related to your topic whereas 'CLICK HERE' doesn't. It's just another little trick to get the search engines to see you and rank you.<br /><br />Depending on what you are trying to achieve online, will probably dictate which route you take to get ranked with the search engines. I chose to learn how to build backlinks to promote my article marketing campaigns. This technique can also apply to websites or blogs. You first find a keyword you would like to use. Then you build your content around that word or phrase. Please keep in mind the content you create should be of good quality and it should be original. Either you submit your article to a subscription site or publish your website. Now you can start building backlinks. You should start by looking for social networking sites. These are sites like Twitter, Flickr and Facebook. You make posts on these sites that are relevant to your content and at the end of your short post you can attach a link to your site. Now remember if the site wants you to post linking text, use the name of your article as the text. I hope this helps you understand the amazing power of backlinks and will help you increase your online income.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTkyNTAyNS9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Extensive Records On The get backlinks In Bit By Bit Order</a>

However, please keep in mind that spammy or generic comments can reflect badly on the school. Links in blog comments, meanwhile, won't help your SEO, however, they can be a good tool for building your brand, getting visitors and increasing future backlinks.<br /><br /><strong>Leverage social media</strong><br /><br />The more great content you share, the more likely someone out there will retweet or repost something and help generate an inbound link back to your website.<br /><br /><strong>Think quality not quantity</strong><br /><br />It's better to have ten quality backlinks than a hundred lousy inbound links. Paying for links or using link exchanges or other link schemes is just not worth it, especially since Google may punish your website for using these tactics. Be patient and focus on quality.<br /><br />When someone is interested in making their website better, more user friendly and they want their keywords to appear higher up in search engines, they must not only provide well written content for their readers, but they must also look into getting several backlinks.<br /><br />If someone is looking for techniques to get backlinks to increase SEO, here are some tips for them to consider:<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 1: Add relevant keywords:&lt;/b&gt; When a person writes content that includes their keywords, it can help them out tremendously. Whether they use the keywords in the article title, in the body or they put links along with their keyword in the article, they can benefit in more way than one.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 2: Get good links:&lt;/b&gt; If someone's looking for techniques to get backlinks to increase SEO, they must consider getting good links. When a person gets a link from a strong, well-known and authoritative website, it will be worth much more than a link from a site that was just built a few days ago. Google's algorithmic method will determine the importance, as well as the popularity of the link.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 3: Consider a link building service:&lt;/b&gt; A link building service is a great option when someone is looking to get several backlinks for their site. In order for you to benefit, you must find a reliable and trustworthy SEO expert that has multiple link building strategies and options to choose from.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 4: Offer guest posts:&lt;/b&gt; When a person offers to write content for another site in exchange for a link, this is a great way to build links for a site while not spending a dime.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 5: Offer reciprocal links:&lt;/b&gt; A person can also consider offering to put someone's link on their website if someone does the same for them. This allows two people to benefit greatly.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Tip 6: Create a video:&lt;/b&gt; Videos are a great way to market a website and to add a backlink. Stress free success waits not for those who outsource individual components of the process of generating backlinks and then tries to project manage them all to work together, but for those who outsource the entire process to a trusted and successful backlinks service provider.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTkyNTAyNS9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">In-Depth Information On The get backlinks In Basic Order</a>

Granted, it is impossible to predict what search engines will take into account in their algorithms in the future, but it is a safe bet that the logic behind why high PR backlinks count for 'more' will remain the same.<br /><br />Bear in mind that although 'PageRank' is a grading system used only by Google - other search engines have been known to employ similar grading systems and very often pages with high PageRank end up doing well on these other systems as well.<br /><br />PR, which stands for PageRank, is Google's system of ranking web pages that get displayed when you search for certain keywords. PageRank uses many mathematical algorithms to rank pages on the internet. PR works on the basis of 'backlinks'. Backlinks are also referred to as 'inbound links' or 'incoming links'. Google's PageRank considers a link from one page to another a 'vote' by the first page to the second. A page that receives 'votes' from high-ranking pages, in turn, get high PRs themselves.<br /><br />For those people who run their own websites, high PRs are very important. Having a website with a high PR ensures that the page is displayed among the top few search results in the Search Engine Results Page, or SERP. If the page is among the first few displayed results, it receives more public attention, and hence, more traffic. There are many different services on the internet that allow users to create multiple backlinks to their websites, as a result of which the the pages on that website have high PR backlinks.<br /><br />Some of the methods that are used to increase the popularity or ranking of a website include relevant linking, three-way linking, two-way linking, etc. Relevant linking involves linking to a website with similar information or content. This is a very 'natural' backlinking process, according to search engines. Three-way linking involves connecting three websites in a chain through links. If it realises that a page is deliberately hosting links to several other pages, which in turn, are hosting links to this page, the search engine dynamically excludes it from it's algorithm, and does not rank it at all.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTkyNTAyNS9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">How to Increase Website Traffic - 5 Simple Steps to Effective Forum Marketing</a>

Certainly the easiest, but not necessarily the cheapest however it can get complicated so sometimes it's best to go with the professionals if SEO isn't your area of expertise.<br /><br />Essentially what these companies will do is find an academic institute that allows you to post in blogs, or comment, or add content and link to your website from the .edu site assuming the site incorporates 'dofollow' links. Fresh dofollow quality backlinks are adored by the search engines if they stay up long enough and will improve the quality of your SERP rank as well. Link building services often ignore the importance of Gov and Edu backlinks because they are somewhat more elusive. They opt instead for social bookmarking tools and the lower quality backlinks than come from spamming comment sites. These backlinks don't remain active for long as admin usually deletes them so you can see your site rise in rank and drop again just as quickly.<br /><br />Making sure that gaining edu backlinks is a part of your link building strategy is highly recommended. Again, the more trust and authority and association with high quality established sites, the more the search engines will reward you. New content will be indexed faster and so you'll keep your rank more easily.<br /><br />You can buy a backlink pack with several hundred backlinks already included and this is a good thing to do if you are so inclined. You can also buy packs for Edu backlinks and while they'll contain fewer links, you simply don't need as many considering how highly regarded Edu backlinks are with the search engines. The whole process of off page SEO consists of more than just the number of links to your site. For a while, having too many links in too short a time actually meant that a site would be relegated to the back pages of Google since the concept was being abused.<br /><br />It is easy to understand why backlinks are important; it is no different from social proof in traditional marketing. Think of this... if Harvard University uses a certain text book in its courses, then you can guarantee that the author would have more people interested in him. edu backlinks are the online equivalent of this exact scenario.<br /><br />To website owners, edu backlinks are the pinnacle of professionalism and link building. To get edu backlinks is to finally locate the holy grail. There is no use having a well designed website with informative content if your site do not show up in the first few pages of a search engine result. When it comes to Google, where most people go to search the Internet, having other sites linking back to your site (backlinks) is one of the sure fire ways to increase your page rank and visibility in search engines. It is important to appear on the first page because the vast majority of people do not search past the first page.<br /><br />When you get Edu backlinks, you will eventually increase your website page rank. Google gives authoritative pages or sites high page rank and if they link back to your site, your page rank increases as well. With a higher page rank, your website tends to appear higher in the search engine results page (SERP). What Google deems authoritative are pages with informative, verified content which actually help users who search for related phrases or keywords. Some of these authoritative sites are those with.gov or.edu.

For example, phrases like, &quot;Keyword phrase is a good thing&quot; were actually much more common than they should have been. LSI related keywords are much more typical in regular writing created for real users. For example, this article on SEO also mentions links, content, page rank, Google, and backlinks. These are just the kind of LSI related keywords that would be present in an article written for a real human being.<br /><br />3. &lt;u&gt;Backlink Quality Over Quantity All Day Long&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Google had to do something to ignore the influx of spammy link-building tools that are all essentially designed to cheat Google's algorithm. Google relies heavily on 3rd party links to interesting sites to occur naturally. Unfortunately, this aspect of Google's search is often skipped to just skip straight to backlinks without increasing the user experience to get those backlinks.<br /><br /><strong>So what makes a quality backlink?</strong><br /><br />The ideal backlinks possesses all of the following characteristics:<br /><br />?? Comes from an established web domain<br /><br />?? That particular URL also has its own incoming quality links<br /><br />?? That site links out links out to a select few pages<br /><br />?? Link is a dofollow backlink<br /><br />?? Most importantly, if a site is high page rank, it is likely to possess all or most of these features.<br /><br />To move your site up in the search engine, the message from Google is clear - quality content and quality backlinks.<br /><br />The internet today is a very competitive place for internet marketers. Google and many other search engines need to be able to trust your website, and that is where page rank comes into play. The more page rank your website has coming to it from trusted links, the more your website will be trusted by the search engines and your rank will start to improve. How do you find these high page rank backlinks for your website? Well I like to use a little tool called SEO SpyGlass, in my opinion it is the best search engine optimization software for finding the high page rank backlinks that you need in order to rank well.<br /><br />So how does SEO SpyGlass work to find high page rank backlinks?<br /><br />Well the software allows you to enter your competitors domains into it, and then shows you the backlinks of your competitors. Basically you are spying on your competitors link strategy so that you can use the links for yourself and out do them to take page one or even the first spot in Google or any other search engine! That is not all it also gives you a wealth of information about each link.<br /><br />What kind of information does it give you about each backlink?<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the link is Do Follow or No follow&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Anchor text (very useful)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Page PR&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;External Links (less is better)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Link Value&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Domain IP (so you do not link from the same IP too much)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;DMOZ Listing&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Yahoo Directory Listing&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Alexa Rank (lower is better)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Domain Age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br />This is why I think SEO SpyGlass is the best search engine optimization software out there!<br /><br />What information should you focus on the most to gain high rankings in Google using this tool?<br /><br />Well after I analyze my competitors links I only focus on the most important information to gain rank. You can also use some No-Follow links if they have a low Alexa ranking you can still get lots of traffic from the links that are on their site alone!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMTkyNzU0MC9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Simple Ways to Increase Website Traffic and Leads</a>It is worth noting right from the start that PageRank (or PR) is generally a ranking used by Google to 'grade' webpages.

Social media has made such a big impact on business more than 70% of companies now have a Facebook page.<br /><br />Social media does take time and work and must be done effectively. Below is a list of ten social media mistakes and what you can do to prevent them from happening.<br /><br />1. Not Being Consistent - You cannot post on your Facebook page or tweet here and there. You have to draw up a social media plan and schedule your time spent on your social sites.<br /><br />What You can Do: Make up a daily and weekly social media schedule and stick to it. Plan to spend maybe an hour a day working on your social sites. Do not spread yourself too thin. Choose a couple of the best sites and give them the time and attention they need to work their magic. I would recommend Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.<br /><br />2. No Interaction - When people comment or post on your pages, you need to answer them and thank them. If you do not respond to people who visit your page, they will just stop visiting.<br /><br />What You Can Do: Check your sites at least twice a day to see if anyone has posted or left comments. Take the time to answer them thoroughly - a quick thank you will not always suffice! Then you should go visit their site and reciprocate. This will help keep your pages active.<br /><br />3. Not Adding Personality - You want your social sites to be a fun and friendly place to visit but you also need to keep it professional. Don't just post a bunch of clone comments with no personality.<br /><br />What You Can Do: Treat your page as if it were a meeting place for you and your clients. Talk about interesting things, offer special deals and contests, keep things fresh and new. This will make your page live with personality!<br /><br />4. Not Linking Accounts - If you have several social sites and a blog you should be connecting them all together so people can find them all.<br /><br />What You Can Do: Put your social site links on your main blog or site. Use widgets and/or plug-ins that will allow your visitors to easily connect to your social pages. Have your posts go out to all your social sites instead of one at a time.<br /><br />5. Not Asking for Likes and Follows - Don't be afraid to ask people to Like your page or Follow your account. This can greatly increase your social activity.<br /><br />What You Can Do: Put a request in your email signature, put it on your business card, put it on all your office stationary. Post your links wherever possible and ask for those follows. You have to incorporate your social media into all parts of your marketing.<br /><br />6. No Quality Content - You have to give people a reason to want to visit your social sites.

On-site SEO has a lot to do with modifying your title tags, H1 tags etc. while off-site SEO is more about getting other websites linking back to yours. Usually search engines does give emphasize on the number of one-way back links that a website obtains from other sites. So the more you get websites link back to yours, the more you improve your chances to get visible at the top of the Google search results.<br /><br />Now, you can get back links for your website in several ways. Here I am going to cover some of those sources:<br /><br /><strong>Submitting your website URL to different directories </strong><br /><br />Once you have your website running live online, make sure that you have your website url submitted in as many directories as you can. They can be great sources of back links for your website. However, if you are planning to do it by yourself, there is a good possibility that this will turn out to be a very time consuming task if you are not an expert in this line. In such cases, you can always hire a professional SEO team to take care of the work. This will save you a whole lot of time that you can invest in other areas of your business.<br /><br /><strong>Buying Links from other Websites </strong><br /><br />You can buy links from other sites to increase the number of back links for your website. At this point, try to get some links from high PR (Google page rank) web pages, as they are likely to give you more SEO juice in comparison with just any other ordinary web page with zero or no page rank.<br /><br />Any body who is learning SEO (search engine optimization) has heard the word 'backlinks'.

Granted, it is impossible to predict what search engines will take into account in their algorithms in the future, but it is a safe bet that the logic behind why high PR backlinks count for 'more' will remain the same.<br /><br />Bear in mind that although 'PageRank' is a grading system used only by Google - other search engines have been known to employ similar grading systems and very often pages with high PageRank end up doing well on these other systems as well.<br /><br />PR, which stands for PageRank, is Google's system of ranking web pages that get displayed when you search for certain keywords. PageRank uses many mathematical algorithms to rank pages on the internet. PR works on the basis of 'backlinks'. Backlinks are also referred to as 'inbound links' or 'incoming links'. Google's PageRank considers a link from one page to another a 'vote' by the first page to the second. A page that receives 'votes' from high-ranking pages, in turn, get high PRs themselves.<br /><br />For those people who run their own websites, high PRs are very important. Having a website with a high PR ensures that the page is displayed among the top few search results in the Search Engine Results Page, or SERP. If the page is among the first few displayed results, it receives more public attention, and hence, more traffic. There are many different services on the internet that allow users to create multiple backlinks to their websites, as a result of which the the pages on that website have high PR backlinks.<br /><br />Some of the methods that are used to increase the popularity or ranking of a website include relevant linking, three-way linking, two-way linking, etc. Relevant linking involves linking to a website with similar information or content. If it realises that a page is deliberately hosting links to several other pages, which in turn, are hosting links to this page, the search engine dynamically excludes it from it's algorithm, and does not rank it at all.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT03YTgzOTBiNTEzZDQ0OThiYjVjNGZlNzY1YTU4NDJhNyZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD03YTgzOTBiNTEzZDQ0OThiYjVjNGZlNzY1YTU4NDJhNyZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhN2E4MzkwYjUxM2Q0NDk4YmI1YzRmZTc2NWE1ODQyYTdQb3N0JTNhYjUzYzI1YTUtNjAwMy00NmVjLThiMjMtODU5MjAxMWYwMTNk" target="_blank">Increase Website Traffic - Is Having More Content Always Better?</a>

Today you'll learn how you can easily begin to increase your back links with authority edu back links from high page rank blogs.<br /><br />However, not all links are created equal. Some links simply have more power and influence in terms of getting you ranks for your particular keyword of phrase. Links coming from educational organizations (or .edu links) come from institutions of higher learning. These types of links are generally regarded by the search engines as having higher degrees of 'authority' and 'trust'. The catch is that .edu links are often thought of as being difficult to obtain.<br /><br />It's simple - If you have a lot of .edu back links there is a greater chance of your website ranking higher in the search engines.<br /><br />Recommended Tools For You EDU Back Link Campaign<br /><br />Here are few recommended tools that you'll need to implement the technique we're going to give you.<br /><br />1.

The problem is that many owners were seeing these types of low quality sites at the top of their rankings and they were really providing no real value.<br /><br />2. &lt;u&gt;Low Quality Content is Toast&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />No one really knows for sure what filters Google applies to determine just what exactly is &quot;low quality content&quot;. Our best guess is that much of the SEO-types were writing their content for search engines rather than real users. This low quality content often left a signature as it was stuffed with the same keywords over and over. For example, phrases like, &quot;Keyword phrase is a good thing&quot; were actually much more common than they should have been. LSI related keywords are much more typical in regular writing created for real users. For example, this article on SEO also mentions links, content, page rank, Google, and backlinks. These are just the kind of LSI related keywords that would be present in an article written for a real human being.<br /><br />3. &lt;u&gt;Backlink Quality Over Quantity All Day Long&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Google had to do something to ignore the influx of spammy link-building tools that are all essentially designed to cheat Google's algorithm. Google relies heavily on 3rd party links to interesting sites to occur naturally. Unfortunately, this aspect of Google's search is often skipped to just skip straight to backlinks without increasing the user experience to get those backlinks.<br /><br /><strong>So what makes a quality backlink?</strong><br /><br />The ideal backlinks possesses all of the following characteristics:<br /><br />?? Comes from an established web domain<br /><br />?? That particular URL also has its own incoming quality links<br /><br />?? That site links out links out to a select few pages<br /><br />?? Link is a dofollow backlink<br /><br />?? Most importantly, if a site is high page rank, it is likely to possess all or most of these features.<br /><br />To move your site up in the search engine, the message from Google is clear - quality content and quality backlinks.<br /><br />The internet today is a very competitive place for internet marketers. Google and many other search engines need to be able to trust your website, and that is where page rank comes into play. The more page rank your website has coming to it from trusted links, the more your website will be trusted by the search engines and your rank will start to improve. How do you find these high page rank backlinks for your website? Well I like to use a little tool called SEO SpyGlass, in my opinion it is the best search engine optimization software for finding the high page rank backlinks that you need in order to rank well.<br /><br />So how does SEO SpyGlass work to find high page rank backlinks?<br /><br />Well the software allows you to enter your competitors domains into it, and then shows you the backlinks of your competitors. Basically you are spying on your competitors link strategy so that you can use the links for yourself and out do them to take page one or even the first spot in Google or any other search engine! You can also use some No-Follow links if they have a low Alexa ranking you can still get lots of traffic from the links that are on their site alone!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT1jNWQ5Y2ZjN2I3Njk0Nzk1OGU2NWY4ZTM3YjhkNDJjYyZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD1jNWQ5Y2ZjN2I3Njk0Nzk1OGU2NWY4ZTM3YjhkNDJjYyZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhYzVkOWNmYzdiNzY5NDc5NThlNjVmOGUzN2I4ZDQyY2NQb3N0JTNhMzFlZTY3ZmUtYmE3YS00MDgzLWE4NWEtZDA5ZjUxODA0MzEx" target="_blank">Increase Website Traffic</a>It is worth noting right from the start that PageRank (or PR) is generally a ranking used by Google to 'grade' webpages.

If you have been spending countless hours on blog commenting campaigns or submitting your latest blog posts to all the social bookmarking directories in hopes of getting a couple of up-votes, this article may be for you.<br /><br /><strong>1. Comment on other blogs</strong><br /><br />One of the easiest ways to get backlink for your blog is to leave comments on other blogs. Almost every blogger allows you to hyperlink your name to your blog these days. Try not to be spammy about it or you run the risk of being blacklisted. One link per comment is plenty.<br /><br />Some blogs have the &quot;nofollow&quot; attribute, which tells search engine spiders not to follow your link, enabled on comment URLs. DoFollow blogs are better for your blog's Page Rank, but nofollow links still increase your link popularity.<br /><br />Remember that the comments you leave represent your blog. Try to add something useful to the conversation already in progress. Be friendly. Offer advice when you can and your link will get clickthroughs from other bloggers and readers.<br /><br /><strong>2. Post in forums</strong><br /><br />Most forums allow you to include a signature at the end of your posts. It is a high priority to find and post in popular forums with high volumes of traffic, but it is equally important to seek out smaller, more niche oriented forums where your link will be most relevant. If you offer sound advice and help out other people in the forums they will probably visit your site too.<br /><br /><strong>3. Offer free advice</strong><br /><br />This goes along with posting in forums, but people often underestimate the power of sites like Yahoo Answers. Although you can't include a signature, if you are an active source of expertise in your niche you will be surprised how often the chance to link one of your posts in an answer arises.<br /><br />[b]4. Not only does offering digital downloads allow your site to be listed in certain directories, it also produces a lot more organic traffic as the word of your free stuff gets around in various ways.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT03YTgzOTBiNTEzZDQ0OThiYjVjNGZlNzY1YTU4NDJhNyZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD03YTgzOTBiNTEzZDQ0OThiYjVjNGZlNzY1YTU4NDJhNyZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhN2E4MzkwYjUxM2Q0NDk4YmI1YzRmZTc2NWE1ODQyYTdQb3N0JTNhYTNkMDcxYWUtYTBjMS00OGVmLTg0ZjAtMWYwNTM0ZTMxOGQ4" target="_blank">Detailed Notices On The get backlinks In Grade By Grade Order</a>
