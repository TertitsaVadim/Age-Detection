<br />what my pain has come to 
<br />walking throught the halls 
<br />arms folded 
<br />thinking what if someone sees 
<br />trying to act like me 
<br />without throwing my arms in the air 
<br />with every word i say 
<br />with every movement i take 
<br />its so hard to see 
<br />the girl im supposed to be 
<br />when i've got to act 
<br />so i dont ruin my cover 
<br />walking down the hall 
<br />loosing friends 
<br />with a blink of an eye 
<br />woundering why 
<br />did she do something so stupid 
<br />she was my best friend 
<br />and now she is gone 
<br />she cut so much 
<br />she was used to the pain 
<br />but she got so damn pissed yesterday 
<br />and didnt pay much attention 
<br />to what she was doing 
<br />and went way to deep 
<br />though she couldnt tell 
<br />her arm was to numb 
<br />she is now lying on the floor 
<br />with no feelings to her at all 
<br />she has achieved the greatest thing of all 
<br />to feel no pain 
<br />none at all 
<br />just lying their 
<br />in a dark puddle of blood 
<br />no pain 
<br />no fear 
<br />just no feelings at all 
<br />no worries are left 
<br />in her cold pail body 
<br />say good bye 
<br />to all your friends 
<br />to all your family 
<br />to them all

<br />to not fall for you

<br />so it is not the end nor the start 
<br /><br />we are trapped in the middle 
<br />of trying to find out this riddle 
<br />between thoughts and memories 
<br />visiting loved ones at cemetaries 
<br />we lost the loved 
<br />and loved the lost 
<br /><br />but dont come to me acting fake 
<br />because my heart isnt open to take 
<br />for you think it takes a game 
<br />to win my heart; what a shame 
<br />i thought you were different than others 
<br />but i dont want some one like my brothers 
<br /><br />who uses girls bodies 
<br />and abuses their feelings 
<br />so i might as well be 
<br />a mass murder of killings 
<br /><br />so feelings are true 
<br />but the real question here is 
<br />Are you?
