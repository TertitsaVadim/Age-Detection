<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; Two guys, one old and one young, are pushing their
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; carts around Home Depot when they collide. The old
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; guy says to the young guy, &quot;Sorry about that. I'm
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; looking for my wife, and I guess I wasn't paying
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; attention to where I was going.
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The young guy says, &quot;That's OK. It's a coincidence.
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; I'm looking for my wife, too. I can't find her and I'm
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; getting a little desperate.&quot; The old guy says, &quot;Well,
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; maybe we can help each other. What does your wife look like?&quot;
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; The young guy says, &quot;Well, she is 24 yrs old, tall,
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; with blonde hair, blue eyes, long legs, big b00bs, and
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; she's wearing tight white shorts, a halter top and no
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; bra. What does your wife look like?&quot; The old guy says,
<br />  &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Doesn't matter --- let's look for yours.&quot;

<br /><br />A nun walks into Mother Superior's office and plunks down into a chair.
<br />She lets out a sigh heavy with frustration.
<br /><br />&quot;What troubles you, Sister?&quot; asks the Mother Superior. &quot;I thought this was
<br />the day you spent with your family.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;It was,&quot; sighed the Sister. &quot;And I went to play golf with my brother.
<br />We try to play golf as often as we can. You know I was quite a talented
<br />golfer before I devoted my life to Christ.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I seem to recall that,&quot; the Mother Superior agreed. &quot;So I take it your day
<br />of recreation was not relaxing?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Far from it,&quot; snorted the Sister. &quot;In fact, I even took the Lord's name in
<br />vain today!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Goodness, Sister!&quot; gasped the Mother Superior, astonished. &quot;You must tell
<br />me all about it!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, we were on the fifth tee...and this hole is a monster, Mother 540
<br />yard Par 5, with a nasty dogleg left and a hidden green...and I hit the
<br />drive of my life. I creamed it. The sweetest swing I ever made.  And it's
<br />flying straight and true, right along the line I wanted...and it hits a bird
<br />in mid-flight not 100 yards off the tee!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh my!&quot; commiserated the Mother. &quot;How unfortunate! But surely that didn't
<br />make you blaspheme, Sister!&quot;
<br />&quot;No, that wasn't it,&quot; admitted Sister. &quot;While I was still trying to fathom
<br />what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and
<br />runs off down the fairway!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, that would have made me blaspheme!&quot; sympathized Mother.
<br /><br />&quot;But I didn't, Mother Superior!&quot; sobbed the Sister. &quot;And I was so proud of
<br />myself! And while I was pondering whether this was a sign from God, this
<br />hawk swoops out of the sky and grabs the squirrel and flies off, with my
<br />ball still clutched in his paws!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;So that's when you cursed,&quot; said the Mother with a knowing smile.
<br /><br />&quot;Nope, that wasn't it either,&quot; cried the Sister, anguished, &quot;because as the
<br />hawk started to fly out of sight, the squirrel started struggling, and the
<br />hawk dropped him right there on the green, and the ball popped out of his
<br />paws and rolled to about 18 inches from the cup!&quot;
<br /><br />Mother Superior sat back in her chair, folded her arms across her chest,
<br />fixed the Sister with a baleful stare and said...
<br /><br />&quot;You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;What happened to you?&quot; asked his wife.
<br /><br />&quot;I'll never understand women,&quot; he replied. &quot;I was riding up in an
<br />   escalator behind this pretty young girl, and I noticed that her skirt
<br />   was stuck in the crack of her ass. So I pulled it out, and she turned
<br />   around and punched me in the eye!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I can certainly appreciate that,&quot; said the wife, &quot;But how did you get
<br />   the second black eye?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, I figured she liked it that way,&quot; said the husband, &quot;So I
<br />   pushed it back in.&quot;

<br />The doctor took one look at this woman and all his
<br />professionalism went out the window. 
<br />He immediately told her to undress. After she had
<br />disrobed the doctor began to stroke her thigh. Doing
<br />so, he asked her, &quot;Do you know what I'm doing?&quot; 
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;you're checking for any abrasions
<br />or dermatological abnormalities.&quot; &quot;That is right,&quot; said
<br />the doctor. He then began to fondle her breasts. &quot;Do
<br />you know what I'm doing now?&quot; he asked.
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; the woman said, &quot;you're checking for any lumps or
<br />breast cancer.&quot; &quot;Correct,&quot; replied the shady doctor.
<br />Finally, he mounted his patient and started having sexual
<br />intercourse with her. He asked, &quot;Do you know what I'm doing
<br />now?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;You're getting herpes; which is why I came
<br />here in the first place.&quot;

<br />After a while, the priest opened a conversation by saying &quot;I know that, in your religion, you're not supposed to eat pork...Have you actually ever tasted it?
<br /><br />The Rabbi said, &quot;I must tell the truth. Yes, I have, on the odd occasion.&quot;
<br /><br />Then the Rabbi had his turn of interrogation. He asked, &quot;Your religion, too...
<br />I know you're suposed to be celibate. But....&quot;
<br /><br />The priest replied, &quot;Yes, I know what you're going to ask. I have succumbed once or twice.&quot;
<br /><br />There was silence for a while. Then the Rabbi peeped around the newspaper he was reading and said, &quot;Better than pork, isn't it?&quot;

We will no longer accept the Medical Officer's statement as proof of illness as we believe that if you are able to go on sick parade, you are able to come to work.
<br /><br />2. Leave of Absence for an Operation: We are no longer allowing this practice. We hired you as you are, and to have anything removed certainly makes you less than we bargained for.
<br /><br />3. Death, Other than Your Own: This is no excuse. If you can arrange the funeral services to be held late in the afternoon, however, we can let you off an hour early, provided all your work is up to date.
<br /><br />4. Death, Your Own: This will be accepted as an excuse, but we would like at least two weeks notice, as we feel it is your duty to teach someone else your job.
<br /><br />5. Quantity of Work: No matter how much you do, you'll never do enough.
<br /><br />6. Quality of Work: The minimum acceptable level is perfection.

<br /> ON A ROPE
<br /><br />Eleven people were hanging on a rope,

<br />10 men and 1 woman.
<br />The rope was not strong enough to carry them

<br />because otherwise they were all going to fall.
<br />They weren't able to choose that person,
<br />until the woman gave a very touching speech.
<br />She said that she would voluntarily let go of the rope, because,
<br />as a woman, she was used to giving up everything for her

<br />used to always making sacrifices with little in return.

<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them
<br />to,
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         mean they don't love you with all they have.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         LOVE
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         Jim and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital. One
<br />day
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; while they
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; jumped into
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; there.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom
<br />and
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; pulled
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         Jim out.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         When the Head Nurse Director became aware of Edna's heroic
<br />act,
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; she
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital,
<br />as
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; she now
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         considered her to be mentally stable.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         When she went to tell Edna the news she said, &quot;Edna, I have
<br />good
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; news
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         and bad news. The good news is you're being discharged;
<br />since
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; you were
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and
<br />saving
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; the life
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         of another patient, I have concluded that your act displays
<br />that
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; you
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         have a sound mind.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         The bad news is, Jim, the patient you saved, hung himself in
<br />the
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I
<br />am
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; so
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         sorry, but he's dead.&quot;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         Edna replied, &quot;He didn't hang himself, I put him there to
<br />dry.
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; How soon
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         can I go home?&quot;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY AND HANG IN THERE.- Remember your point
<br />of
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; view may
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;         not be universal.
