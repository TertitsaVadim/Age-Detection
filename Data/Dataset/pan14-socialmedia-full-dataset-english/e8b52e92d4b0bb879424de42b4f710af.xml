<br />And for us to be together, and never be apart.
<br />When you are sad, I will dry your tears
<br />When you are scared, I will comfort your fears
<br />No one else in the world can ever compare,
<br />You're perfect and so is this love that we share.
<br />We have so much more than I ever thought we would,
<br />I love you more than I ever thought I could.
<br />I promise to give you all I can give,
<br />I'll do anything for you as long as I live.
<br />When you need love, I will share
<br />When you are sick, I promise I will care
<br />In your eyes I see our present, our future and past,
<br />By the look in your eyes I know we will last.
<br />I hope that one day you'll realize,
<br />How perfect you are when seen in my eyes.
<br />Now the time has gone by, in laughs and tears,
<br />These days I will remember, for years and years.
<br />Those memories we have, will never fade,
<br />Because these are the steps, that we have made.
<br />But that was the past, the future is near,
<br />And I just can't wait, for what will appear.
<br />I'll take care of you and treat you right
<br />I'll lay by your side even when we fight
<br />The dreams I have, that all involve you,
<br />the chances I see and everything we can do.
<br />I could go on for days, telling you what I feel,
<br />but all you have to know is my love for you is real.

<br />Ronnie Radke is on probation for 5 FUCKING YEARS
<br />he was so awesome....
<br />god i feel like crying!
<br />its not fair he didnt kill the guy his friend did!
<br /><br />heres what kerrang said 
<br /><br />&quot;Escape The Fate singer Ronnie Radke pleaded guilty to a charge of battery with substantial bodily harm at a court hearing on January 15.
<br /><br />The singer, who has subsequently been fired from the Las Vegas-based punk band, was also sentenced to five years' probation as well as being ordered to pay nearly $100,000 in damages in relation to the death of 18-year-old Michael Cook on May 6 2006.
<br /><br />According to police reports, Radke's former friend Marcel Colquitt challenged him to a one-on-one fist fight at a secluded stretch of desert near to their Las Vegas home after Radke refered to Colquitt's girlfriend as &quot;a crack whore&quot;. 
<br /><br />Radke brought along three additional people and Colquitt brought along four. Both sides were armed with knuckle-dusters and baseball bats. A firearm was also involved in the altercation. 
<br /><br />The incident ended when Radke's friend, Chase Rader, shot and wound Colquitt's brother and killed Cook.
<br /><br />&quot;I don't think probation is good enough for him,&quot; said Cook's mother, Ceda Freeman. &quot;He has absolutely destroyed my family.&quot;
<br /><br />Colquitt, who was due to appear as Radke's co-defendant in the case, committed suicide in September 2007.&quot;
<br /><br />ITS NOT FAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
