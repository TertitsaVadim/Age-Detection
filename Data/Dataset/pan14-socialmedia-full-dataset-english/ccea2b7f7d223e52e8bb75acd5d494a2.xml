So customizing your own beach towel is certainly something worth doing.  The following are some helpful ideas on how you can go about doing this yourself.  <br /><br />Get a beach towel you want to customize and lay it out flat.  Don't lay it on a dirty surface, make sure everything is clean and washed, including the towel.  Don't forget to clean everything, it's vital to the process.  Over sized or novelty towels are the best kind to use for personalization.  <br /><br />Now it is time to get creative and think up a design.  Using materials you have cut yourself or embroidered patches you should make patterns or images on the towel.  Don't just start sticking anything on, plan out your creation before you set anything in stone.  Be cautious.  <br /><br />Fetch yourself some thread and a needle.  Begin sewing the patches in place when you have decided exactly how you want them to go on. <br /><br />It is best if you can get your hands on a sewing machine because the end result will be far more robust.  Sewing by hand is fine but it won't be as durable.  Embroidered letters are a good choice as well, sewing on your name could be worth a thought.  You can create customized towels as gifts for a number of occasions, such as a wedding gift.  Combine the beach towel with some customized bath and hand towels and you can create a lovely set of towels as a gift for anybody.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myindospace.com%2Fblog%2Fview_blog.php%3FBlogId%3D278779%23viewdetails"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myindospace.com/blog/view_blog.php?BlogId=278779#viewdetails</a>
