Well a bit of both but it is definitely an improvement on  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officeformac2011.org%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officeformac2011.org/</a> .<br /><br />Office for Mac is always compared to Office for Windows, most packages are compared on rough comparisons as they are not a like for like product, however seen as how Microsoft develop the same suite of applications for both OS you would think they would be a replica of each other.<br /><br />However this has never been the case and certainly hasn't changed with it's latest iteration. There are steps showing progress such as losing Entourage and gaining Outlook. The user experience is much more friendly and is starting to look like it's Redmond brother. There are also a few problems, there is still no Access database application and the experience still seems a bit crowded unlike the simple smooth version for Windows.<br /><br />Now then when we dig a little deeper we see a speed immense speed increase,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officeformac2011.org%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officeformac2011.org/</a>  for Mac took forever to load and often crashed, Office 2011 is a massive improvement on both these things, which is great. The User Interface itself is much improved with better graphics and effects.<br /><br />For the average user  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officeformac2011.org%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officeformac2011.org/</a>  for Mac is everything needed and as good as the Windows counterpart, most users don't use it's in detail high end features but for those who do they may find they are missing and some features are lacking, such as macros.<br /><br />As a whole we are impressed by it and think that Microsoft are taking Apple users more seriously by providing a product not too far away from it's Windows edition. Microsoft had to do something really as many Mac users use iWork which is compatible with all of the Microsoft standards and does a miles better job, as the Mac fan base grows more and more people will ditch Microsoft Windows and if things stay as they are Office also. If they step up their game users may bring Office to the Mac with them which can only help Microsoft.<br /><br />iWork to me still wins hands down, it is cleaner, more attractive, packs more features and also has a much cheaper price tag, but only time will tell if Microsoft will lower the divide and get something that makes people think twice in their office package selection. As for Microsoft missing out it's Access application, FileMaker currently fills that void and it does a good job of doing so too. Windows to Mac converts will obviously prefer something they know such as Access but if Microsoft won't provide it again they are potentially going to loose a large user base.

Microsoft had to do something really as many Mac users use iWork which is compatible with all of the Microsoft standards and does a miles better job, as the Mac fan base grows more and more people will ditch Microsoft Windows and if things stay as they are Office also.

As for Microsoft missing out it's Access application, FileMaker currently fills that void and it does a good job of doing so too. Windows to Mac converts will obviously prefer something they know such as Access but if Microsoft won't provide it again they are potentially going to loose a large user base.
