<br />family love......ive experienced ups and downs in this department and the only love in this catergory that although it has gone up and down is my lil brother
<br />parental love......dont even need to think of this one is my mother the one person who has been there no matter what has always been there in the toughest times and saved me from hazordous dangers
<br />Now comes the tricky bit
<br />Puppy love.....lets start from the begining shall we...puppy love is the most childish of this spectrum of emotion and usually happens at the start of puberty i would have to say im unsure of it im geussing it would have to be a boy in primary school his name was Robin.
<br />Infatuation.....often confused with sexual attraction as they often work hand in hand. this is also called love at first sight as ive often stated about Romeo and Juliet if they loved each other they wouldnt have wanted pain for the other and would have ran away at the very start its when u meet someone and instantly want them and then the feeling fades within a day or two.....and im geussing the only person i know ive been infatuated with is a man called Tom Scott..
<br />Sexual Attaction......are yes the one that comes to us all no matter who we are.....and we can have it about a vast number of people. it is an emotion purely based on sex hence the name and if you meet someone who says they love you and then they want you in their bed with in days.....its just hormones they dont love you they just want sex this one working in hand with infatuation is often mistaken for love but one will always follow the other and they will never happen together and dont think i have ever been infatuated with anyone and just wanted to fuck them.....i geuss im sad like that having only slept with two people one being someone who was more like a best friend and it just happened and finally the big one the daddy of the big five just like everthing in life....five sense five fingers five toes and well thats all the fives i can think of but let me get back to the point the last one is love........this is the one where all those feelings fall together this is true love and yes i must say i am in love but with who cannot be stipulated........sit down and think about what ive written everyone and see if youve had any of the above
<br />Peace

<br />Whatever happened to the time when relationships meant something when people fell in love with people because of who they were not just for a quick fumble tumble. i mean come on get with the programme i feel like im one of the few people out there who actually go into a relationship because they have thought about it and actually feel something for the other person..
<br />how many women and men out there have fallen for someone hook line and sinker only to have them back out during a time of need....it just goes to prove that the people of today are not just born with silver spoons in their mouths but most of them have argos home section in their too
