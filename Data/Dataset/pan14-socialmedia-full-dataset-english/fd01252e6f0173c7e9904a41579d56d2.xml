<br />&quot;And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Let the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Truly I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.  And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.&quot;
<br /><br />I think we should respect children and have them go first instead of last all the time.  We should pay attention to them and teach them they are cared about, and if not by family and/or friends, by a Loving God (certainly) and someone out there (probably).  We should be honest with them where we are:  Do we love them?  Do we care about them?  What aspects of their lives do we care about?  What don't we care about?  Why?  Why not?  We should make our interests interesting if we want them into them.  We should tell our children who can help them and/or how they can get their goals, interests and needs met without needing us.  We should teach them what to do with freedoms and give it to them.  And as a Christian who has witnessed children coming to Jesus and to Faith in The Lord Jesus Christ (Son of God, God Who Came in the Flesh), I think it's good and healthy and even important to tell children about The Lord Jesus in a good way (even if they don't come to Faith that day, I mean, if you don't believe, it's highly unlikely you're going to pray with them a prayer where they accept the Lord Jesus, but they'll know Somebody cares for them, wants them to go far in life and live a full life, no matter what kind of day you're having).  And if you do care, they got a lot of Positive Influence around them - they got you, and Someone Perfect, you can't go wrong there.  Let them come to The Lord Jesus because He cares about them and can give them a better life than they'd have if they missed out because of you.  When parents come bringing their children to get them near Jesus and you're representing Him, keep those children near to you &quot;Let the little children come to Me.&quot;  Don't neglect them, don't push them away from front.  Don't keep them out of the way, they're important.  If you offend one of them, you will regret it.  I've seen and heard of all sorts of sick things parents do concerning children:
<br />1 I've seen a mother use a child's pair of underwear (they weren't wearing at the time) to wipe their nose.
<br />2 I've heard of a culture where a dad can use anything (hand, foot, object - any) to beat their kid
<br />3 I've heard of families who have 'friends' over who have managed to secretly (sexually) abuse the children - even 'Christian friends' and relatives, it's not safe to just trust anybody anymore (I know some of them)
<br />4 I've heard stories and met people whose parents don't know about the bullying or worse that goes on in their young lives at least until they're a fair bit older
<br />5 As a child, my parents and caretakers (not all of them, but the ones I was exposed to most often) instilled fear into me concerning doing things in my Beliefs that I've still been working through to this day, nobody personally taught me how to apply the Bible; I didn't get a youth-age Bible of my own until my friend gave me 1 when I was nearly 15 (my parents and family were Christian, they taught me the basics of Prayer to ask God for stuff, put me in Christian schools where I was bullied and teacher's pet, didn't read me much of the Bible, took me to Church sometimes)
<br />6 As a child, my parents left me to the television as a mental babysitter, where I got brainwashed into thinking violence was cool and humans were insignificant panickers; I'm still working through violence, being reminded on occasion by God Himself that He doesn't like it!  Nobody communicated in a way that reached through and said, &quot;you know, you don't need that stuff, God's got so much better for you than being a slave to the TV,&quot; in a way my 12 year-old mind grasped.
<br />7 In school, the teachers did nothing about the kids who teased me; when somebody cursed me by telling me that the devil was watching me (12, I still fight demons today, I forgave everbody at fault), I didn't think to tell the teachers.  One teacher let the kids make fun of my God and Religion because I had said bhudda was a myth in a single moment of anger because they kept saying his name just to tease me because I told them not to (I didn't like it).  The teacher never listened to my side of the story, they said to me, &quot;so, you've insulted the great bhudda?&quot;; I thought they believed in bhudda and that I had no chance of the teachers being on my side.  I've been on 4 anti-psychotics that didn't work (made me suicidal) and one anti-depressant that made my throat burn if I forgot to take it with water and the devil didn't go away.  I even tried to stop eating chocolate but soon figured out that didn't work.  I had somebody from the 'Catholic Social Services' tell me (in an attempt to get me on medication), something along the lines of what was I willing to live with'?' (and I thought, had I been suicidal at the time, it might have sent me over the edge.
<br /><br />Moral of story:  a lot of selfish people out there say stupid things to children, teenagers, and troubled people, and many of them don't think to say, &quot;trust in an All-Powerful God, Who can save you&quot; when they run out of answers, or even, &quot;oh, keep living, don't give up, you're doing good hanging in there&quot; or &quot;if there's anything I can do to help...&quot; or even &quot;I'm sorry I can't help you, keep your Faith, This looks like a good Help to you&quot; (some say stuff like this).  No one says to a child, &quot;you know, I'm sorry, yesterday, I acted like an idiot, I hope you know that and that I didn't hurt you too much.  Do you think you can forgive me?&quot;  We can't be perfect, but Jesus can, so refer them to The Lord Jesus (even if you don't think He exists) if you're too messed up to help them out (tell them about this page if you're stumped, tell them I care too).  At the end of the day, it wasn't the nice-intentioned people who really got me through.  Very seldom did I even text somebody to pray for me at 3 in the morning.  It was Jesus.  The Holy Spirit (God, we have a Connection) told me, when I was seriously-enough considering suicide to imagine the most painless way, &quot;That isn't a good idea!&quot; and later showed me that if I did commit suicide that I'd be in hell with even more demons (torturing me worse than) they do now.  Everytime I've been near falling away from the Faith, avoiding Church, having a mental breakdown, being suicidal (etc), God has always stopped me from it, rescued me.  Some people might not feel like they've had this experience; I've had (times where I seemed to fail, where things didn't seem to working out), but when these things happen it's best to trust God and keep watching for what will happen.  I've seen Him come through for others before, heard about it, even though one of them waited a while.  The Holy Bible Story of Job is good.  He had 3 idiots for friends too, and wife who couldn't be with it, and he had to wait through all that while being sore with a horrible disease (or more than one), and then still, yep, God came through and He told off his 3 friends (when He did).  If you're a kid reading this, know that God cares for you, more than anybody else can around you, even me, and there is a big wide world out there.  Jesus came down to earth and lived for you (perfectly) and died on a cross for your sins to be away so you could be alright.  (everybody does sin except God, Jesus is God, in the Flesh - don't let anybody tell you different. and Jesus after He got buried, in three days, came back alive)  It was spectacular, the Resurrection, the (Holy) Bible tells you about it in Matthew (Chapter) 28: (Verses) 2, 3 and 4.  I'm really sorry if nobody else seems to care about you at the moment.  Because your parents may never think to talk to you about how things are for you (instead of why things are, always making excuses), you could try writing them a letter to them, explaining (whatever you want to, why you think they're doing wrong, if you're angry at them, if you're scared of them, if you really want to live with somebody else, what you'd like from them, and to please write back, what you're thinking about doing if they don't listen to you, what you wish would happen, what you like, why you like it, something going on at school, if there's anybody they like who you don't and why, anything, and to please not yell at you because that's not them listening to you).  If you don't have a pencil/pen/writing-tool and paper, try asking somebody nice at school - there's always the principle (or a nice teacher) (on a good day).  And the school might have a computer with a printer they'd let you use.  And you may be able to write letters to the teacher too, or the principle.  It's always good, if you don't know the person (won't listen) to write a letter to the person who is causing you a problem (if they're another kid who might just rip it up, try giving it to a grown-up to read to them.  It might work better.  If there's something you don't want a grown-up to know, put it in code, keep the meaning written down with you so you remember, and if the kid asks you what it means, tell them.  If they're a bully, just tell a teacher secretly and ask them to please not tell them it was you).  The grown-ups who you write letters to should listen (but if they don't, write another letter to another grown up who could talk to them.  For instance, if it's your parent, write to the teacher, if it's your teacher, write to the principle, if it's to a grown-up who hits you and does things like that and you're sore the next day, write to the police, and give the letter to a nice grown-up or a friend with a nice mum to give to the police station if you can't get it to the police station yourself.  Remember on those letters to put your name and address, the place where they hit you, the place where they were at when they hit you - try getting an adress for that place -, the name of the person who hit you - the full name if you can - a detailed description - as detailed as you can - of the person who hit you, and as much facts as you can - do they hit other people? -are those people children?.  And when asking the questions, be careful, so they don't find out what you're doing it for, don't tell them about what I said if they hit you, and never never NEVER mention the word &quot;police&quot;/&quot;cop&quot;/&quot;pig&quot; or any other known term for them.  Hopefully this will never happen to you, hopefully after enough letters, people who right ignore you, give you orders, feed you bad dinners without explaining why, send you to school without even telling you that it's going to get better, yell at you with explanation, and stuff like that will treat you nicer.)  If you're a grown-up, please treat your kid nicer, they want you to be nice to them, trust me, you'd want your parents to be nicer to you, and if you're treating them nice (they've told you from their heart with no fear or hiccups, &quot;yeah, I think you're doing a good job&quot;, then you're doing a good job.  And don't worry about being a bad parent, or seen as a bad parent (it doesn't help, one of mine did), work towards being (the best parent you can) with your kid's help, communicate with them (find out what they want when they're old enough to tell you, they've learned how to talk), and of course do teach them good rules, much as they want stuff around, they do need that.  If you're a Christian parent, then pray - God talked to at least one of my parents and they knew when to give me space once and that was so good for me - He will never let you down.  Whoever you are, if you're inclined toward ignoring children, teasing them, hurting them, doing stuff that doesn't help their emotional development, please try to consider what it is that causes you to behave like this.  There's probably an underlying undealt-with cause that when you deal with it, you will feel better (altogether) and be nice to children.  There was a time I used to be scared of being too close to children, but seeing how much God loves them has changed at least a little of my attitude about this and I'm thinking, maybe knowing as much as I do about children and seeing how many people around them don't, I should get involved with them more.  I've just gotta work through my lazy streak and my unmotivated depressing state and few other issues first that are keeping me tied away from even a lot of society, especially children.  Maybe the net is a good way to get involved.  I care, I believe in God and Jesus, I just have a hard time getting out of the house unless there's something I have to go to.  God loves you, Jesus loves you.  End of Blog.

<br /><br />1 is spiritual, u need Jesus to help u against that, and all the thought patterns the depression brings, He can get u out of even if nobody else cares to and/or has time.
<br /><br />2 clinical, where ur physical brain isn't producing enough of a helpful balance chemical called ceretonin.  Taking a medication is usually helpful and I still know of people who don't miss their dose or their whole mood swings for the day, it seems to really help them.
<br /><br />3 I don't know what u call it, I call it just a physical lack of things.  For it, I've heard of and been applying where (in New Zealand) I eat salt with things now, because it has iodine, and everything in New Zealand soil doesn't.  Without iodine, the brain can seriously suffer all kinds of things which I don't specifically remember except depression.  Also, dark chocolate and chicken and a few other foods I know of (but forgot about) contain ceretonin.  Also, one I feel very unmotivated for at the time is exercise, so I'm trying to start out easy and slowly start working out more.  Another thing I heard of is taking a walk when the sun is setting or rising, where when you are out looking at that, a nerve in your eye starts a chain-reaction of some sort, causing your brain to produce cerotonin.  And my friend has just told me laughing is good for [fighting] depression, and so to find a funny site. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Thoughts I've had to change and could still be working on:
<br /><br />I can't ... -&gt; Yes, with God's Help, I can!
<br /><br />I can't be bothered doing... -&gt; sorry, complacent is bad, yes I do care about the people God loves and died to save (starving people in third-world countries, my family, my other family (other Christians, across the world), people out when I'm walking, the school next door, anybody else in my path and/or who my Creator puts on my heart)..
<br /><br />I don't feel like... today! -&gt; (still working on this one) other people are worth it/ but I want to, really!
<br /><br />Truths I've found:
<br /><br />I have a goal (several ideas and dreams and stuff, actually); there is Someone out there Who can help me; there is actually a being <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> that wants to stop me from doing my dreams and will cause feelings of fear, doubt, depression, and anything else imaginable... ***** him, it, not even a person, so move on past him/it!; sometimes, people try to stop you or slow you down at your dreams (or at least they seem to do a good job of it);  if you've got a good dream, and God doesn't say anything about it being a bad idea, why let anyone stop you? - I've had to forgive such people (even my family) and move on, still trying to move on, I'll either take 'em with me if they wanna go with my dreams or I'll let them go (altogether), who knows, maybe they'll come with me.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  (I want to be a missionary)

They make third-world countries out of first-world countries, they jail people for no real reason than they know too much or they have a belief, and they're now effecting people the nations' conscience.
<br /><br />(Here' goes)  There is a God Who, unless you change your wicked ways, will punish you very badly.  He is All-Powerful and All-Knowing.  He is Perfectly-Good.  But He doesn't want to punish you at all because He cares about you, in a good way.  He made you after all.
<br /><br />Here's what you do:  stop killing people, stop torturing people.  (If you have any questions, then you can ask me on the comments.  If you don't speak English, you may need a translator for the comment back from me)
<br /><br />And another to the lazy (who aren't trying to try) and the complacent (only caring about themselves and their families, not caring about who God cares about when He lets them know):  Wake up, it's your world too and if comes to an end, you die too and so do your families (God doesn't like it when people don't care about other people, it's not a loving way - Love should go two ways, God loves us, we should love Him back or at least the other people He made who we can see; Love can grow so don't worry about how you were now).  You can at least pray if you're Saved, and if you're not, you may want to try getting Saved (This will help you change the world).  (If you don't know how to take action and want to know more, ask me back on Comment).  If you have a disability or some valid reason for not doing much, don't worry, it's not on you to help the world, I know you care enough about it, I'm only talking to the people that should be pulling their weight and are leaving it to too few individuals.  It's not on the ignorant too much, because they don't know, but I'm letting you know the world's got problems.  To read about them, you can click on my next blog.
<br /><br />Love to you all anyways, stay tuned for my next blog about world problems, you may need a decoder unless I do a summary as certain words aren't allowed on this website (and I don't swear even, they just wouldn't let them on)*  Goodbye, May God Bless you.

		<document id="e0dc1c83e575ced4f0f58d9d528ad240" url=""><![CDATA[Some of the Problems I've Seen in the World<br/><br/> Hi, I told you to stay tuned for this update.  The world's problems are as follows:
<br /><br />Pollution:  This is my guess, leaders of countries are doing nuclear experiments which are harming the ozone layer and blaming the cows and the cars for it.  Meanwhile our cars with their exhaust pipes are actually polluting the air.  Somehow, India has a big cloud over it (which makes not much sense to me unless they just happen to have more cars and/or with worse exhaust than America or China or the cloud comes from else where), and New Zealand has the thinnest section of ozone over it in the whole world (with only 4 million people and pretty fresh air, but it does have some element in it's petrol/gas which America has taken out).  In New Zealand, you can see the blue sky while in Los Angelas area, the sky is a tad tinted brown (still looked blue enough to me last time I visited).  People have tried to come up with a vehicle that only ran on water (very clean), but everybody who has invented one has &quot;gone missing&quot; so we still don't have it yet.  We need the companies behind the petrolium to get on board and own water-charging stations (electricity plays a part in having it run) and the electricity companies to let them have it so that rather than going out of business, they change business and are no longer looked at as baddies.  They can still produce lipstick and vasseline, I was never killed by that, but lets face it, petrol/gas stinks and clouds the air.  Maybe if they get paid less, they should have less to pay for taxes.  And the nuclear guys just do have to stop.  They got all our money, why not use it on something good like making more food for one of the problems I plan on listing below.  There is other pollution too, like oil leaks (be more careful), garbage/rubbish being dumped into the sea (stop that, find somewhere else), and nuclear waste (I have no idea what you can do about that, except stop using nuclear, and pray for your planet)
<br /><br />Child-mistreatment:  There are the normal problems that go on in some domestic situations where one or both of the parents get drunk and begin to hit the child(ren), they need help to get off alcohol and counselling.  There are the other hidden (normal) problems where the parents get away from nearly all of the responsibility for the child(ren), and give them over to the TV, their relatives, school, anywhere, and show them no love nor protect them; parents like this need to wake up, before their children maybe aren't virgins and are messed up (they need to establish a loving relationship where their child[ren] can trust them and then to ask about their child[ren]'s lives.. Are things going OK? for instance, and How's school going?.. maybe What TV show is that [during the commercial, not when it's on]?  What's the story?.. just know what's going on in your child's life and if they're watching a cult-show, getting bullied at school or not.  And they may need to apologize and prove to their child they are really sorry before the relationship can start, and maintain their child[ren]'s trust from then on, may need support from other adults, getting support from God is the most helpful idea I can imagine).  Then there's a problem on a whole wider scale, where the parents actually sell their children off as slaves.  To what?  Yes, there's chocolate factories and shoes involved, but there's also a whole different business that men enjoy with 5-year olds!  Yeah, it's really that sick!  What parent would do that?  A desperate parent who doesn't see any other way out, as they have other children to raise, just like the desperate woman in the west sells herself, the desperate parent sells one or maybe even more of their children [I don't know to the full extent except there's a big disgusting business going on, some men even come from the west and they take advantage of this situation].  This is one of the most shameful things besides a dad that would force his sick doings on his own daughter (that's happened in the west and tried to in Russia).  We need to do something about this!  We can pray against these atrocities (if you believe in a God - hey, try to know God better too, this really helps your life which will cause you to be more effective in your work and cause), we can try to tell the [men, parents, and dads] that they are wrong, we can try partnering with organizations who give the poor food or their land back, and we might even be able to raise awareness through the internet and our voice to our listening people or writing it down somewhere (if you're in school and get an assignment where you can write about any of these issues, then by doing so, you can help your school teacher to become aware, and maybe they'll start letting their listening ears know somewhere; if you can read it to the class, do so.  If you can, try to share a solution with them on your paper so they're not just worried about stuff)...
<br /><br /><strong>There are organizations of secret evil out there</strong>, which have infiltrated almost every kind of employment imaginable (even the Big Office in America).  They c-t babies in half with sc-ss-rs, make people who &quot;know too much&quot; &quot;go missing&quot;, worship the devil at their highest oath, sacrifice human beings to powers or the devil, pronounce curses on themselves and their families to the 3rd or 4th generation (and I've seen some of those curses succeed, or heard about them playing out) with some evil force, fly out of their bodies and steal our answers to prayers and include them in their spells, influence events on the earth when out of their body, tell certain leaders to (or just by themselves) make a choice that will cause a bad result for a country (eg, war), suppress any knowledge about religious truths or extra-terrestrials, and probably other stuff. (I'm not afraid to &quot;go missing&quot;!)  Solution:  [Christians] pray hard, do your best to get rid of bad habits and bad ways etc [with God's Help] as the prayer of a righteous [person] avails much [and remember, Jesus is our Righteousness, He took away our sins with His Blood] and be serious about God's Kingdom and Will; non-Christians, I don't know what to tell you, as there's not much [physically] we can really do.  Anybody who tries really hard to raise awareness ends up &quot;missing&quot;, and I'd never somebody who isn't yet on their way to Heaven to take such a risk, so unless you're willing to join us, do nothing, because they'd do worse to you than change your religious status, so try to act like focus on the other problems you can help us solve if you want to solve them.
<br /><br />Starvation in Third-World Countries:  pretty straight forward right.  The land doesn't produce food because of lack of nutrients and too much salt due to blood, due to war(s).  Maybe the land does produce, but the people don't own it, hence to get food, they are selling their children.  And in other places, there just isn't any farming going on for an unknown reason.  One solution is to get the poor people's furtile land back.  Another solution is to relocate the poor people to some land nobody owns and cultivate the war-sorted land with something that'll neutralize the sodium and get the furtility-factor back, give them seeds and get them another source of food until the crops grow (this promises no security from jealous people so we may need China or America or Russia to guard them and capture any thieves with guns - shoot em in the leg, keep em alive already but don't let them hurt the poor, keep em off the land).  Another solution is to move the starving people to the shore and have them go fishing to keep alive.  Help build their villages, teach them all about fishing.  Perhaps Japan could share some of their whales they caught with them.  Arresting the greedy people who force the parents to sell their children could be in order (the parents don't like their situation and do need freedom).  Either way, we should import food to these countries (we may have to get country-leaders'  permission to do so).  Also, we need to supervise the food-distribution as some governments or leaders intercept the food and take it away from the starving and poor people before it gets to them.  Now, it's unreasonable to expect the civilians to organize a food-giving rally to Africa from anywhere in the West and far away places from Africa.  This should be the governments'  chore.  We can, however, pray, raise awareness, get rallies which tell our governments we want action (at least in the West, this should work, in a communist country, you may want to take a different approach, maybe a polite one as too small a rally could be fought with guns resulting in suffering and waste of time.  If enough people politely approach their government and pray for them, the governments and dictators might consider taking action for the starving countries.  If you are in a starving country, you may want to seek help if you are in power to do so, otherwise, raise awareness through internet and when you have enough friends, go to your government if it's safe to and politely approach him - otherwise, just keep asking people in free countries for help secretly).  We can try asking the markets how much food they get rid of without selling it ever (their excess) and report totals to leaders who would be shocked.  And, don't forget the sources of food - how much do they throw out?
<br /><br />Oppressive Regimes:  There are some countries, where to talk about your religion, or to say one bad word against the government (I'm saying you should diss them) gets you at least thrown in jail if not worse.  In some countries, human beings (including children) are hurt continuosly, very badly (t-rtured) for either what they believe, or for simply not worshipping the government, or both.  This is rediculous.  The government shouldn't be worhipped, nor any other simply human ruler of a country.  And people don't want to, they shouldn't be forced.  And while the Holy Bible says we should respect the countries'  rulers, It says we should only worship God (Creator of Heaven and earth, more about Him later).  People shouldn't diss governments, but at the same time, governments shouldn't retaliate by going over the top and hurting their bodies while they are defenseless in jail.  And people shouldn't be put in &quot;re-education&quot;  camps for saying &quot;God exists, we're having a Church at our house&quot;.  Solutions, pray for the people in this situation (including the rulers), write respectful letters to the government asking for freedom of your Belief, write to the prisoners if you can and tell them you care about them and their situation and are doing your best.  Appeal to your government to help those oppressive countries have religious freedom.  Make the killer do 15-hour/day labour if you need someone there, don't pick on poor Christians and bhuddists who aren't out to do you any harm.  Leave the Jews alone, Hitler's done enough  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Women:  In some countries around the world, women are mistreated.  They do not have gender-equality with men, they are expected to do more work (given back-breaking loads), they are female-circumsiced, they are violated s-xually by men, they are bought for marriage at as early as 7 years old by old-middle-aged men.  They are beaten by their husbands whenever they displease them.  Solution:  pray, bring out education to these countries saying it's wrong and why (to us, it's obvious why those things are wrong, we have love and our concience would feel guilty, but to them it's not wrong unless they're caught being wrong and their religion says some of that's okay and doesn't require them to seriously love every single person on the planet), raise awareness in the West and other countries where that stuff is wrong and tell them they should do the same if they can.
<br /><br />Mental/spiritual problems:  As leaders have stopped teaching people about God and giving society awareness of demons, not just the odd case but several human beings are being struck by what I can only guess to be demons.  There has been a high suicide-rate, all over the world.  With no fear or belief in God, and no Teaching to stop them, teenagers and children have disrespected their parents enough (because of their pain and problems their parents don't deal with) to go about their s-xuality as if they were animals, then to have their &quot;rights&quot; to get their baby cancelled (what mammal does that?!), and then they have post-traumatic stress disorder.  Some of them are too ashamed to tell their parents, so they don't get any counselling and they keep it bottled up which makes things much worse.  Out of purely demonic drive, some stressed out people cut their wrists (some actually try this to end their misery on earth).  Some people feel so Spiritually drawn and needing that they go to other spiritual &quot;sources&quot; like fortune-tellers and other &quot;churches&quot; that aren't mainstream Christian, which isn't good because it's worse for you than living on junkfood, people feel fed but they are really un-nourished, but are too proud and &quot;put off Church/Christianity&quot; to seek the Answer, they think they've got the answer.  What's the problem, they got demons, demons hurt people, they risk putting Christians off Christianity on a weak day (causing depression and wrist-slitting for the quitter, I had a friend who did that!), and they're still headed to h-ll.  Plus, they don't superly help the wrist-slitter, the depressed, the suicidal person, they can't.  The people with a serious demons on them need to know God can Help them (and is Willing to, if they just ask Him).  All the &quot;mentally healthy&quot;  people I've seen, who aren't Christian (and even one catholic) couldn't help me in my problem.  One even said, &quot;how much do you want to live with&quot; to me (thankfully I wasn't at a serious suicidal stage at the time), and most people in effect, told me to &quot;shut up,&quot; and keep it to myself.  &quot;There are no such things as demons!&quot; from the non-believer (even from people in my Church), the demons saying, &quot;surrender!&quot; in every way it could be communicated.  ...So, what's the solution?  For Believers who know, it's obvious, pray more, pray the suicidal people in this country to know God loves them!  And, if you can, get active (be part of Youth Helpline, try to make a program that educates why to/or just TO keep living to go through schools, make a KEEP LIVING! logo and put it up as many places as you can, raise awareness on the internet, or anything else creative you think of, work with other issues)... if you're not there yet, you don't know there is AnyOne or anything Spiritual/spiritual out there, just keep taking a look around, ask God if He exists and any other questions you have, try doing the physical solutions you see above... on the other side but still want to help with some of these issues?  You can still put KEEP LIVING signs up, and do your best, still I'm urging you to reconsider.  I know there can seem to be a lot of people who don't care, especially when you go to a Church sometimes.  Getting a Holy Bible and personally seeking God could be a better way to go.  Don't let what some human being did put you off God, you need him, so leave them to Him and don't lose Faith.  
<br /><br />Note, (whoever you are), the closer you get to God, the [more and] better you can help in any situation.  (Love to you all from God!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />)

People like rugby and music, it's got Christian heritage but besides values looks mostly non-religious, people like to eat saussages and other cultural foods, we have a lot of beautiful heritage (green hills, clear sky, lots of beaches, sheep in the countryside with some growing population of cities), people tend to look down on p-litics and we're prone to earthquakes because we're on a fault.  America has started influencing New Zealand over the last generation or two or three through television and other stuff, and we have a lot of music artists.  We got some problems in the youth particularly, and people are generally very tired but otherwise would want to help more if they could get aware.  As a Christian, I fight the apathetic streak of my country.  And New Zealand has something, where if somebody is doing really good for themselves, the rest try to cut them down.

(You may think nothing of it, you may think I'm an unhealthy person.)  I chose it for a reason.  Back in 2009 when I was in Bible College, as a Christian I saw an internet Testimony of a female human who was saved out of being in a satan-worshipping cult where she had been taught that she was &quot;the bride of satan&quot;.  She told out her story, it was intense for me, I was sheltered growing up.  A lot of hard and horrible and weird things had happened to her during that time she was part of the cult, including having demonic powers to push certain people away from her and drinking urine and 2 other bodily fluids as part of their so-called &quot;communion&quot; and being violated regularly by a &quot;priest&quot; of it.  Finally, one day, her and some witches decided to go to a Christian (God with Benny Hinn) meeting.  (The witches were going to teach her how to curse Benny Hinn.)  When she went, she saw a heap of light around the place, and was a bit (freaked out).  There she saw so much Light with Benny Hinn, and she didn't know why they wanted to curse him.  In the middle of when he was preaching, he looked at the witches and gave them a warning, but then said to the woman, &quot;You're gonna be saved soon!&quot;.  And after the meeting, whe burst in the doors, some Christian in there got her sorted so the demons went away from her and she became a Christian.  She said all that cult stuff before seemed normal.  And the whole time she was telling, her face was covered (shadowed) so you couldn't see it (maybe so nobody dangerous could see it, sometimes when you quit a cult or a religion, people around you from where you were get angry and try to kill (and/)or hurt you (depending on how the religion's being taught and the people's attitudes who are around you).  When I saw this testimony (plus reading another of a former satanist who was saved), heard the story, I was moved in two emotions:  1, I wanted more people who worshipped the devil to come to Jesus and be one of Us (that was cool, and I realized that it wasn't impossible!);  2, I felt really sorry for people who were in cults that did such bad stuff to their lives, I wanted all the more to somehow help (be part of) getting them Saved (to Jesus, just getting them out of a cult with no way to Heaven makes them a target for their cult to hurt them and kill them or reconvert them for no reason - a total waste of time because the healing process would cause their awareness of their pain and messed-up life to increase.  Besides, there's no other god or being that I know of that is as powerful as or more powerful than satan except the God of the Bible, ask me about Him if you want to know more).  So I fasted for them, the first year, for 5 days (but I couldn't cut out eating all meals or drinking altogether because I was in Army-style physical activity then so I thought I should do something more dramatic).  For 5 days, I &quot;Fasted Blue&quot;, all my fluids were not white, red, or yellow.  I mixed blue food dye into white yogurt.  I mixed this yogurt with any milk I had so it was blue.  I drank drinks like blue poweraid.  I wore a blue hat, I slept in a blue sleeping bag, I wore no red or white or pink or yellow beneath my waste, I skipped lunch, and I ate rice bubbles instead of cornflakes, so was hungrier.  (During this fast, a lot of weird stuff happened, not like the other groups I had been fasting for previously.  Physically, there were a lot of blackbirds around outside; I was tired, and my Army leaders decided to get us to do my least favourite activities during the week and I even could predict a few.  We had to do 1,000 push-ups in one day for instance, and climb lots of stairs.  I got my least favourite job on volunteer help day, I didn't get much sleep. A blackbird even ate some of my lunch when I left it outside a little while to help a two-year old.  Mentally I was very tired and my concentration was all-time low due to my body's tiredness, but having no white, yellow &amp; red fluids kept me safe.  When doing my job, I was in my imagination a lot and having some experience with the demons' mind games that is somewhere in my trauma file.  Also, another Christian there heard of what I was doing and discouraged me saying something like, &quot;that could be dangerous!&quot;.  Spiritually, God was still sustaining me.  I was getting attacked by heaps of demons but that was normal anyways, and to this day, I don't know if there were some out-of-body devil-worshipping humans who were spying on me.. I had this one dream of this guy walking through my room (he was a suspect for satan-worship, but I never really asked him, and when I prayed that they'd all get kicked out of the Bible College, later on I found out he got kicked out, and he said it in a way that makes me wonder if he knew I prayed that!).. and my hope-tank got super-drained to two thirds or half (which it never does) and the demon of condemnation's form came in view really clear (it wasn't just the devil hasseling me like how he normally did; I thought condemnation was ugly until I actually saw the demon of blasphemy which looked worse!)  And at the end, I was so feeling wasted that instead of being friendly, polite, patient, withdrawn, or at least biting my tongue, whenever somebody annoyed me, I said something like, &quot;(Leave me alone!  I'm wasted!)&quot; I was just tired and whinney all day, the day after!  But in that fast, I drank an orange fanta (it wasn't red or yellow, it was a perfect blend or a bright beautiful other colour besides blue, and it even had a bit of blue on the logo).  And as I was drinking it, I got an idea to &quot;fast Orange&quot; the next year (2010).
<br /><br />So I fasted orange in 2010 and had fanta, carrots, apricots, anything else orange, tried to avoid yellow fluid or red or white... but it felt so much easier, like I was putting in no effort (it was near the end of the year, I nearly didn't, so I crammed it in!)... I was recovering and had come off of medication so I was taking it easy that year.  To this day, I like fanta (I don't enjoy the taste that often, but I remember the satanists, the witches, the other-siders who I pray for whenever I drink it or see it nearly; I remember how I hope they'll be saved), and I couldn't find any other brands I liked so I chose Fanta.  Now you know I'm praying for them.

Besides daydreaming and sleeping in, everything else that I seriously want to do is like reasonable.  Why can't I just preach to kids and tell them about Jesus and God?  My parent won't let me, the police would remove me if the teachers called them, the teachers don't want me just on the other side of the fence.  Something about me scares them even though I've never threatened the kids and the kids all liked me enough, so they've probably talked to the kids now.  Cause now the kids tell me to go away and warn me they'll call the police, there's mind-poisoning (fear-instilling) for you!  Stupid secular-policy rules, but I could still get around them if my dad would just let me, and stop being so afraid.  It's not like I'm telling them any bad messages, and these teachers don't care if these kids don't make it to Heaven cause they never heard of The Lord Jesus The Saviour from anybody.  I'm so mad!  But my dad has stopped me from doing many things that I think are beneficial for other members of my society (though has helped me with some of my ordeals) but has always stopped me based on worry for my safety or for worry about the peace of mind for those people... it's always been fear and it's wounded me spiritually.  I'm sick of it, I'm sick of fear, I'm sick of my parents controlling me!  It's bad enough I'm still a virgin at 24 because my dad doesn't want to let me marry my boyfriend until I'm like &quot;more ready&quot; (not like we couldn't carry on with protection stuff, living in separate places until we paid off our student loans), now he's so averse to me preaching the Gospel that I feel a crushing sort of pressure.. he's probably not the only one, my grandma's that way too when I start telling strangers that Jesus loves them, my mom has been big on if I make noise in past times but I've hardly seen much of her (and now think she's really cool and miss her)... I even just now considered moving in with a bunch of *othersiders who had no rules and being as straight a preacher there as I am when out and about and agreeing to pay rent.  Yeah, those hard-core people who ***** sacrifice stuff to the devil, asking them if I could live with them and just be a hard-core Christian while living there Lol!  Like they'd let me in!  And if they did, would they really let me be or would they do they do harm to my body?  Man, what am I thinking, am I losing the plot - yeah, I know I pray for them but, and even do tell them the Message about The Maker &amp; Saviour sometimes, and yes I want to visit them at their house, but live with them?!  Oooohhh, maan, whatz wrong with me?  Am I that bad a rebel?  I decided not to get away from my home and go with them at the end.  I just gotta find the right moment and/or the Strength to just come up with an organized mind to my parents and say something like, &quot;look, I'm gonna do what I want okay?  and if you have issues with it, then that's just too bad. ...&quot; I really am scared of what might happen to me; scared over the top that I'm going to have to leave my house and all my stuff including the nice lovely internet wireless thing I bought behind or something like that.  I want to move out discreetly with friends who are Believers in Jesus Christ or to a boarding institution but I thought I heard quite clearly from God not to move out this year, but now I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if He did tell me to move to Lower Hutt, when, how much of it I can choose myself without doing a sin, etc... I really do need to get more Discernment when it comes to hearing God's Voice; so many others get it right, and also so many others get diagnosed with schizophrenia and given meds for it which help them, not me I got given the medicine but I still didn't stop hearing.  I still didn't stop feeling... I still didn't stop getting attacked by demons that were tempting me to do suicide.  No, it like never stops for me... anyway (nevermind, gotta go)

		<document id="e02f490a7216fe731a3514fe67f430ab" url=""><![CDATA[The Pledge to the Flag<br/><br/>When I was four years old, in Pre-school, I learned something called &quot;The Pledge to the Flag&quot;:
<br /><br />&quot;I pledge allegiance,
<br />To the Flag.. of The United States of America,
<br />And to the Republic, for which it stands,
<br />One nation.. under God,
<br />Indivisible,
<br />With Liberty and Justice for all.&quot;
<br /><br />In what's called 5th Grade (Year 6, I was around 10 - 11 years old), I learned what The Pledge meant.
<br /><br />In 7th Grade (2nd Form, Year 8, I was 12), I learned that it the Law for me to go to school.  School was a miserable place to me.  People made fun of me for anything they saw, whether my Religion or the pimples on my face or the way I dressed.  If I ever told the teachers, they never did anything about it.  They never punished the other kids.  One teacher even told me off for insulting bhuddism when the bhuddists had started the whole thing as if they were a bhuddist, and the teachers let the kids say bad things about God.  A kid cursed me, causing me mental illnesses from devil watching me and telepathically talking to me and sending demons to attack me every day, even until now (I'm 24, that's half my life, as it happened when I was 12, in 6th Grade).  By the time I was in 7th Grade, I wasn't telling anybody I was a Christian unless they asked me, I wasn't planning on sharing about my Faith with anyone.  I was too afraid to ever show somebody my Religion again, in case they made fun of me and said bad things about It.  And when they were starting the day out with the Pledge to the Flag, I always mumbled whatever I said under my breath so nobody could hear what I was really saying or praying.  When I spoke, I said the following:
<br /><br />&quot;I don't pledge my allegiance,
<br />to the flag.. of the un-united States of America,
<br />and/or to the republic, for which it stands,
<br />one nation, under gods,
<br />divisible,
<br />with no liberty and justice for all!&quot;
<br /><br />and sang, &quot;...the land of the enslaved, and the home of the cowardly!&quot;  no teachers did any kids justice.  
<br /><br />Now, at 24 years old and having witnessed their atrocious crimes from overseas, and even seeing islam work on them like it has every other country (perhaps they perfected the technique planned for America, using it in variations on every other country first, and England was the final practice!), I now am about to say the following for an official record (even if they deport me to North Korea):
<br /><br />I un-pledge my allegiance,
<br />to the Flag.. of The United or un-united (I dunno) States of America,
<br />and to the Republic, for which it stands,
<br />one nation (not under God, they took out the Ten Commands and Prayer in Schools, at least punished one person, a 5-year old for saying Grace over her meal at school; I even hear they arrest people who preach the Holy Bible on the streets, therefore we Christians are denied freedoms of our Beliefs, but thankfully not all freedoms yet),
<br />divisible (there are corrupt officials in office yet God-fearing citizens and probably Christian officials and obviously people who wish to take over and corrupt my former country),
<br />with no liberty and justice for all (under 21 at least and all preachers), 
<br />IF  the leaders of the country of The United States of America don't listen to me!
<br /><br />I plan on getting around to emailing Obama and any other important people I think I find, and if they either don't reply for over a year or they say these ways are okay and allow (gays to marry, kids to bully, muslims to take over, prostitution, abortion, people to get away with murder, etc. while cracking down on illegal immigrants and maybe arresting more stoners or something small like that, hypocrytical), I'm gonna lose my respect for them altogether except that they're human.  If they're half-satisfying, I will try to continue our conversation until they change their wicked ways.  They condone torture of so-called &quot;terrorists&quot; in other countries, still in their name.  I admire how at the moment they still have prostitution illegal and suicide illegal.  In un-pledging my allegence, I don't mean any harm to America, just I'll be like a foreigner to them - no joining their armies (who they encourage to kill lost souls to hell in God's Name - they make Christians look bad while not acting like a true Christian nation who would only resist another nation peacefully), no saying the pledge to the Flag, no more capitalising Flag, America, United States, etc... no more singing the national anthem - stuff I mostly wouldn't do anyway anymore but now just official.
<br /><br />At least I didn't commit suicide and/or shoot up some kids at school like some kids who were picked on continuously.  They should smack people's hands in my thought!  Maybe if it hurt kids to bully and tease other kids, they'd stop doing it (at least every day)
<br /><br />Arrrgh!  Emailing Obama's so harrrd!  I'll try again - this last line is a modification as you guessed.

		<document id="3d14d1f7e64776fc7942be8fc1074530" url=""><![CDATA[Churches<br/><br/> Hey all I just thought I'd write a blog about my little Church-World, I personally think It's trippy in a good way.  Okay, so I don't claim personally to be any denomination because of my personal Beliefs, the Holy Bible Straight, but I've been accepted into and even belong to some, as they don't deviate from the main Bible too much if at all (or I don't know of it because they we're not that close; I usually always know a person or group's religion, non-religion, or beliefs in regard to mine when I get to know them - this can happen in two weeks or a 15-minute conversation, twice as long can change it if God is Helping me; sometimes it takes longer depending on how much I get to know the person, but I already like and respect them before that)... Ok, so back when I was um... before-born, maybe before-made, my dear mother made a decision to shelter me from the catholic church (which I think was a good idea as I meet so many non-Christians who were raised catholic, not just straight Christian; the only other effective ways to keep a person from becoming a Christian for a while is raise them atheist being loving or in another major-world religion being strict, or if they find something they like a lot first but that's not their parents causing it).  The second Church I was in, I don't specifically recall because I was a baby, but my mother's mother (my Nana) baptised me in the back.  Okay, so as I grew up, I went to my dad's mother's Church (my Grandma's), a Lutheran one, just a little as far as I remember.  My mother took me to various Churches of all sorts when I was a child and we had a car.  In one of them, I started just casually speaking another language after the Sunday-School (cool, don't know if it's a spoken language on earth or in Heaven); another, I was Dedicated to The Lord when I was 6 years old (this was before I became a Christian, not until I was 7, I didn't even know the term until after I became one; even thought I was going to Heaven up until then, then afterward I realized that I only really was after I got Saved, nobody told me this).  Around when I was 11 years old, I learned the order of the books of the Holy Bible, just out of enthusiasm.  Many years, it was an off and on thing to go to Church (I felt starved of Church, and Bible Stories, while my friends at my Vacation Bible Study I attended every year seemed to be full of Church and tired of It even, as my mother didn't have a car for a while and we actually slept in).. When I was 14 yrs old, I moved to New Zealand.  No more Church.  I didn't notice it, seriously.  I was in a new country afterall, and had only a week before my own school, had my own room, had more freedoms, had everything I imagined I needed then.  I still prayed whenever I felt like.  One day, sometime later struggling at school, I had a friend who I invited to my birthday party when I was thinking of starting a corporation, which I still might start (if The Lord Wills and I live, technically).  She was the one who invited me to her Church.  It was something I had never heard of before, Anglican.  The Youth Group was pretty cool, they had Holy Bibles which I was reading without them telling me to (drawn to them).  Moved away to Wellington (nearer to city), but just down the road from an Anglican Church.  (but I never went to It for a while because I slept in until 1:30 in the afternoon; went to bed late, 15 you know, and exempted from a regular school-place, doing home-schooling to reach my dreams).  One day, as I was passing by, I thought I would challenge myself to wake up earlier one morning and walk down the road to this Church.  I looked at the sign, and to my pleasant surprise, It didn't start at 8 in th morning, It started at 10! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> So I did it (but I think I was late, the start of a new routine I was to continue at a later development in my existence).  They had nice food out which appealed to my sweet-tooth and cups of tea and coffee afterward.  I started going again (always late).  On December 23rd, 2002, when I was 15 years old, I read a booklet &quot;The Reason Why&quot; and on that day (Jesus won my respect at another level, He cared and was tough enough to take all that for me to get Saved and go to Heaven!) . I decided to get more serious about Believing in Jesus.  I still thought I was an alien, as cable-television had messed me up (since I was 9 - 12 yrs old, the harriest when I was late 14 - 16 and 1/2), but I trusted Jesus enough to know He actually wanted me to get close to Him (an evil thought that had popped up in my head concerning Him had caused me to feel too afraid and ashamed to approach Him in a personal relationship where I'd actually talk to Him or say His Name in more than an ordinary Prayer).  (I'm going off on tangeants aren't I.)  Anyways, back on a trip to the States, I went to my Grandma's Church again for a while and grew Spiritually, with my mind in darkness and my body sleep-deprived with a temporary case of insomnia while they woke up early where I was staying.  I took a class at that Church and got confirmed (as a Lutheran).  I went back to New Zealand, and when I was at the Anglican Church on Sundays, I discovered that the Minister was actually saying something at the Sermons (before, I never used to listen to them or be interested).  For a while, I tried going to &quot;The City [Church]&quot;, but thought I heard God tell me to leave there so I left (I started having Visitations at around 15-18 from Jesus, Theories about how God could have scientifically made the universe at 15, and vistations from the devil at 15 where conversation happened instead of just evil thoughts being shot into my head; I was 16 when the demons attacked).  I went to another Church, an Apostolic One.  It was a good Church, but I was missing St Jude's (down the road, I had a young friend there by then who was telling me to come back!), and somebody up the front mentioned something about &quot;your Home-Church&quot; and I just figured I should go back to St Jude's.  Then I moved to Lower Hutt, freedom from parents finally I was 19.  So I stayed some months at an old haunted building with new stronger demons who couldn't oppress me because the human ruler in the house didn't give them authority so I just lived there until the main water-pipe broke (me and my cat, and a family or so; we still connected with the outside world, and probably on a nearly daily basis; some of us went to courses of studying, others I believe went to work; some home-schooled or did domestic stuff there, but still went out whenever they had to or simply wanted to; the only thing to discourage us from going out was that it was up a big hill, 5 minute walk down or so, seriously big)... didn't go to Church except House Church then but was sharing my Faith with some of the other people at my course in the other haunted building (which got closed down later).  Later I moved to a suburb in the Hutt, but still not much Church.  Then my boyfriend came over and took me walking with him to his Church (I didn't catch the denomination and don't remember if the name is Hosanna or not), but I liked it there and thought the pastor was cool (he went out on missions to lots of countries).  Then later (my memory goes funny on this) I went to a Calvary Chapel in the morning and Hope Centre (don't recall if they had a denomination) at night and our House Church on Thursdays.  Our House Church was casual, we'd have a meal, talk about stuff, and pray (I don't recall if we read the Holy Bible; I made friends there, as It was very small, I still consider myself part of that Group even though I don't go there at the mo).  When I moved back to home at my dad's at 20 in 2007 (due to lack of money), I went to the Anglican one again, and I got a job with one of the companies which the building out on Thursdays and Mondays.  Later I moved to the Hutt again.  Iwas in those 3 Churches.  I got Full-Immersion-Baptized upon deciding to, with Calvary Chapel, in Eastbourne Ocean, in my favourite and fast-drying dress, I think with my hat and scarf (but don't remember).  I knew somehow, I was making a big decision at 21.  Challenges and tough times lied ahead, and I got a sense of that (that I'd suffer for my Faith more.  It happened; my cat died, a young cat; I lost my over-$100-buspass for the rest of that next month; the lady I was living with got stalked and we all had to stay over at someone else's house for a while; the spiritual attacks had already esculated up to a high rate, but this time I was feeling suicidal and seriously thinking about it more [but Jesus sorted me out He let me know if I did that I'd be in hell with more demons that did worse to me than they were doing on earth.] and I even ended up getting too scared to drink water; one month I walked more because I didn't afford a bus pass; one space of time, I had to pay off a $274-fine that I didn't incur; plus, people asked me for money, stole my cellphones, and cursed at me and said disrespectful things all throughout the year; and other Christians thought I was acting too different and weird in my approaches to reaching out to lost people so they gave me grief too; and I was limited for time on the internet at home, with tonnes of chores and 3 then 4 other people who all wanted the internet on only 1 computer; I'd eat X-amount of meals a day; I signed a commitment to pray 5 hrs a week at a Building at one of my other Churches, so was waking up even earlier than usual; I even went to the hospital that year)... This time when I moved, I was going forward, to a Bible College (there was one Church there, and That was all I attended, also not as far as I gathered a particular denomination - and on our School's Service day, it was always me that got the job of cleaning the place which I didn't like during that time   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/backstage/sweatinghard.gif" alt=":)" /> because I'd phase out of concentration and go daydreaming and take too many hours cleaning at during the whole day)... my dad took me home to Wellington.  I just happened to mention the word &quot;suicidal&quot; um &quot;top myself&quot; is what I said which worried him, so he took me a clinic for psychologists and other team people who could help (maybe).  The guy (when I told him my story) said I had a mental illness &quot;psychosis&quot; (more specifically, &quot;schizoprenia&quot;!  Scary, the only one I know of that's worse is bi-polar, or maybe the one where you just go kill people with no regret the name of I'm a bit fuzzy on)... they tried me on a medicine which worsened my suicidal thoughts and made me add weight (fat!) to my frame.  All the while, I found another &quot;St Paul's Lutheran Church&quot;, same name as the one in America I went to, and a new one called &quot;Arise&quot; which I went to (I don't recall the denomination if It had one) at nights.  Then Arise both times, morning and night, and more days a week.  My meds caused me to feel too tired to want to jump up and down with the rest of the people most times, and I was challenged, even when I put my arms up during Worship.  I moved into a new house with my dad back in the suburb I was before, and started going to St Jude's again.  It was good to be back with my Family there again.  I still went to Arise at nights on Sundays.  And I joined St Paul's Youth Group on ever other Friday, and was with Arise on every other Wednesday in a &quot;Life Group&quot;.  On Thursday nights, I found a small meeting of a couple other people who met up to pray for a Group of people (sometimes called &quot;The Persecuted Church&quot;, as they faced real hard knocks from the people they were living with)... I was on Medication 2 during this time, the attacks were clear on that one.  They put me in a house known as &quot;Recovery&quot; for about 2 -3 weeks, while I was started on Medication 3, and my blood-levels monitored (and stuff) where I went to another Church (It was nice) and listened to my hardcore Christian rap music (Lecrae Rebel and After The Music Stops); a guy gave me $40 for my American CD's because the music (he said) had saved his life, he had been suicidal, don't worry I had copies of the sounds on my MP3 Player and my (PC at home).  I was back home on Med 3 and resumed everything as normal with the exception that I put on heaps of weight and felt really tired.  This year, I've only been tried on one Med (4th one, no side effects except diziness and tiredness during the day and not enough sleep at night, ruining my life, so after I had an episode where I tripped out, I prayed about the meds to get off them, and my dad didn't bring anymore prescription home and my psychiatrist let me off it).  I go to another Church (BluePrint, no denomination), St Jude's (Anglican), a Tongan Church which meets at St Jude's Building which I went to last year, a Chinese Bible Study (Which I also went to last year), my Prayer Group on Tuesdays now, a Bible Study in English on Thursdays, sometimes Life Groups except I'm learning Chinese on Wednesday nights now but they have breaks, my Youth Group every other Friday (and I'm trying to start up a Bible Study on Saturday afternoons, a Writers' Club to get involved with my Brothers and Sis's overseas who are facing persecution, and go out with a group of friends preaching in Wellington on the other Fridays but got grounded this week); also there's some monthly Healing Groups that meet on some Saturdays which I think I was into last year.  Between all my Meetings and my PANging and my hardcore Christian rap music and other cool opportunities like this (I feel quite &quot;high&quot; I believe but I've never tried any drugs, quite cool  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />)

I have people telling me to stop preaching and wanting me to trust them, all of them worried about me, I can handle myself.  I'm hurting myself in a way by imagining stuff and wasting time in doing so.  I should be taking time to be disciplined, reading my Holy Bible, but instead my head goes to outerspace.  I wannit to end, but can't make it end because it's not right to.  I feel like im living in a dream and then a nightmare and then a dream again. sometimes i feel high in a good way and sometimes i feel wasted in a bad way.  i feel the Burden of not only my Family overseas being hurt for their Faith, tortured, but also a burden for my Family here who want to quit and the ones who don't want to start but should.  I know the pain is worth It, and sometimes I feel like quitting, but then I remember one of my Facts that gets me back again.  God always comes thru for me and encourages me.  I'm hanging in there, some Prayer would be appreciated from my Family Members right now.  sometimes, i just know the devil's there, other times i'm scared of him, other times, i'm overwhelmingly annoyed and frustrated that he won't go away like wen i'm busy... i just wish he would go away, but I know the devil's too cruel for that, i kno their ways like the back of my hand, that's probably why they want me missing but since I haven't annoyed any evil cult organizations enough yet, only discreetly (ie, committing suicide, which is what i'd do if i was to quit Believing in The Lord Jesus; if He didn't exist in my mind, why am i living?  but I've seen He does)... I wish even if people thot I was a nutter they'd let me be and stop trying to control my living so that I'm miserable.  Wen i'm free, i'm happy, wen i'm not, i'm sad and angry and a little too scared to do anything without being so sneaky about it!  but i want to hang in there and encourage others who feel down or like quitting too, we r in a Battl, we can do this together, and with the Help of our Creator!  I feel hopeful for anybody who'd change and do better at their life as a result of my existence, hanging in there and suffering was worth it.  try if u want, imagining how Jesus must'v felt.  u know, wen suffering, it's like, this had better be worth it! bsides, wen does it end?  i can't wait til mine ends (only 70 yrs to go, right, or maybe things will get better while I'm still on earth).  Only one thing good I can hope to say to people, maybe two:  keep on living, Someone loves you. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />  (back to the grind)

Then I discovered something evil in myself so I had to give that up to God (before it went in this one person's body), then the Stream looked pure (I believe It was).  So we prayed for them (nothing much seemed to happen, but the sick person took it pretty well and it was hard to tell with the other person as it was about depression and he was a bit drunk), they seemed calm.  The one guy who had the physical thing chatted with me (he was happy I prayed for him, because in the 12 years he'd had this thing nobody had prayed for him shocking, we exchanged phone numbers).  This was just our quiet little Bible Study we do weekly (a variation, with lollies, blue mountain dew and pizza, starting with a movie, us coming and then a reading from a Holy Bible Chapter and a discussion and whatever).  Anyway, afterward, I came out feeling better (than when I wrote my last emotional blog), clean (thankfully I'd managed to forgive everyone who'd gotten to me, after all those f-words).. anyway, yeah, so I listened to some music (which I wasn't too impressed with and was trying to draw the good out of), and it's morning again (with very little concentration bt more than usual, feeling it torture to eat and drink, not dressed and typing this blog, still playing freerice com and managed to read my Bible-readings and knit 4 rows on my cat-square project).. So good morning I guess... there's hope (He always gets me thru my messes before I go completely mentally unstable, He's so good, I'm in Love with Him, can't wait til I get to Heaven bt guess I have to, technically I can, ok haha what to do. but) I'm alright!

		<document id="36e22d1861ababdc17ee4711e5c16699" url=""><![CDATA[My mental illness adventures 2011<br/><br/>so, it happens again.  Respite Home Care.  I'm talking with my dad, occupational therapist and psychiatrist, we almost get rid of my meetings with the psychologist, and in the middle of that all, we discuss about me going to Respite again, while starting a new dose of an old medication.  Previously it just might have been working to clear my head but at the time I was also fasting (a religious practice where I voluntarily went for some time without food; I did it because I thought I heard God tell me to in my head, and got away with it &amp; no damage done, lost some weight even) which might have cleared my head.  I was hearing God more and satan less (at least a little, he's a blabbermouth with nothing positive to say to me, always argues with me, threatens me or tries to convert me to worshipping him with no promise of Everlasting Life after death).  So, anyway, we were hearing from the occupational therapist, that Respite will probably not have anything open and not for too long.  Later (not back on this med, anti-psychotic #4), I hear that we could be taking me to Respite &quot;next Thursday for 2 or 3 weeks&quot;, so I tell all my friends at Church that I might not see them &quot;next Sunday&quot;.. in the week I'm all geared up for Thursday, have a few more things to do but not gotten round to them.  Suddenly, its &quot;Tuesday&quot; and I have to be ready in a couple hours.  &quot;Can I say goodbye to my friends on the internet?&quot; I ask my dad. &quot;No,&quot; he says, I've just gotta hurry up.  So we finally buy that cable for my MP3 so I can listen to it there without headphones (I'm really into my music, and the last time I had done that, it had saved someone's life)... and we go ... all the way out into Whitby where it is, same old house, I recognised it from last year!  Same yard, same cat, but different this time, he was a boy not a girl like we'd thought about him last year, meow! &gt;^.^&lt;
<br />The stay was pretty boring over all, I was very sedated when we started me on my med #4 again.  med #5 was fine aside from a few nightmares which arguably could be caused by oppression over me when I sleep.  I was taking med #4 with it, and again, fasting, for my friend.  meds #4 says &quot;Take with food&quot;, so I ate liquid soup and drank up 'n go to compensate for the meds.  I had previously been on water for this person during the daytime and solids at night, but I was more stressed out about him now as the day for praying for him was fast approaching.  my friends might have to cast a demon out of this person so I was perked up for his situation.  The meds were sedating me.  Then, as the day got even closer, Friday, he got prayed for on Sunday, Respite made me go out on an adventure:  I was to catch a train out to Wellington, meet up with my friend, bus to Vincents [Art Place], bus back to Early Intervention Service for my psychologist, then catch a train back to Porirua and a taxi to Respite's address in whitby with a taxi-voucher which my occupational therapist would give me when I got to her office.  When I got into Wellington, I decided to buy more things for my fasting.  As I was about to purchase them some bad thoughts about buying them (I should not by them) came into my head.  Then, suddenly my hips started crippling on me (twisting involuntarily).  I just about had to kneel down and crawl!  I figured it was just the demons attacking me, so I rationalized buying the things and carried on.  I met my wellink worker and explained to her that the demons were just attacking me physically this time instead of mentally.  she was a bit surprised and concerned for me.  We took the bus to Vincents [Art Place].  When there, I was still getting attacked.  somebody offered me a yogurt but I assured them it was a spiritual problem and I would be fine, &quot;Jesus always saves me out of things like this&quot; I said.  it carried on with my neck &amp; speech, torturing my neck.  I resisted and drew the othersiders (satanists &amp; witches and what-not) abstractly as I couldn't draw things the way I saw them.  I then drew their pentegram as a barrier between them and me.  I drew me with a bag of lollies, confectionaries.  I made it to my psychologist and gave the same explanation.  She was a little not sure what to make of it all.  So they let me go and gave me a taxi voucher for Porirua Station to Respite Recovery House where I stayed in Whitby.  On my way, walking out, my hips got worse, I was outside of the building and walking crippledly to the station.  I even crawled, then got up again.  Some Indian-looking person asked me if I was okay.  I explained demons were attacking me but I had Jesus Who was stronger.  I think I asked him to pray for me. He said I was okay, might have prayed for me silently, and left me stumbling.  Another person, a caucasion person asked me if I was okay.  by that time it was hard to talk, he had me sit down.  I was hearing [V/v]oices.  I wasn't able to discern God's Voice or the demons' voices.  So I listened to the man and sat down.  an ambulence came.  They pricked my finger to test my blood.  They said my blood-sugar was low.  They gave me sugary water and tested it again with another finger; it had gone up.  They talked with my occupational therapist and everybody found out I was fasting.  They took me to the hospital, my dad was there soon after.  They gave me a solid dinner and a few more tests.  They inserted a line in my left arm after taking blood from it.  I lay down and my symptoms were still going.  My dad took me to McDonnald's where I got fries, fanta and a strawberry shake, and he drove me to Respite again.  I never used the taxi voucher to this day, it might be expired.  I've been on solids since but had orange foods to remember my friend who I had fasted for.  The Prayer Session went good apparently.  I got attacked on Sunday but later on rebuked the demons causing it and bound them from it.  it hasn't happened since.  the Respite staff thought it was just my body getting used to the medication.  Then I got nightmares and nights of no sleep.  One night I even pray-Scripture-quoted the gates of hell down.  Anyways I'm back now...

		<document id="45a494f85dfd8cf78ef4b2dc9f50ef15" url=""><![CDATA[Working vs Thinking<br/><br/>I'm in a position where chore-wise I have to look after 2 of my flatmates and our cat.  I count our flat as having 5 People, at least, maybe more.  Jesus lives with us and makes things easier for us all.  Other than God with us and any guardian angels, everything else is hard.  The demons aren't invited so they don't live here, but when they come, they make things harder, but God helps me with them, or against them, and to get through doing the chores.  In terms of mouths to feed, we have 4:  me, my dad, my flatmate, and our cat who has been recently put under my care (I still count her as half-Dad's cat).  My dad and my flatmate can both manage to feed themselves, and sometimes me.  I feed the cat, wash her dish from time-to-time.  My dad works very hard and is very tired at home.  I have to clean up after him 75 percent of the time unless my flatmate does.  My flatmate has just recently sprained her ankle, so can't stand up long enough to cook.  She usually does her own dishes, but seeing the dishes there, it's sinking in that I'm going to be expected to do her dishes.  Me.  I seem to have a pain-quota that I have to measure up to or something.  Before, I couldn't sleep.  I felt or heard like to do different fasts or stay awake at night.  demons were attacking me, and also I was getting lost in my imagination.  I'm on an anti-psychotic which has sedated me quite a bit.  When on it, my body demands the sleep and I find myself nearly helpless.  Also, I got struck with a painful wart on the heel of my foot, my right foot.  Having caught up on sleep and lowered the dose, and with God's Help, things were almost back to normal.  Even though the demons would come and attack me, with God's Help, I'd fight them off.  I was even walking again.  My foot was the only thing not normal, having been burned with liquid nitrogen and scrubbed over 3 weeks, it was sensitive and every step hurt if done wrong.  Still getting to tell people Jesus loves them, still picking up rubbish on the road.  Recently, I pulled some muscle in my other leg, so walking has been painful.  I'm trying to eat more protein to speed up healing in that.  But my dad told me, when our flatmate sprained her ankle, that I should look after her.  I told my dad about my leg, but he says she's worse off.  What I don't get is why my dad can't do the walking for us for 3 days or a week!  Unless he pulled muscles too.  My arm was pulled too (my own fault), but that's nearly better.  My fitness needs to be addressed as I've begun to put on weight again.  If my guts aren't sensitive or full of food, perhaps I can do some crunches later on today.  Don't worry, I plan on cleaning up after all 4 of us, I'm just really slow.  Maybe I should do the kitchen and a little of my room today.  I really do enjoy blogging more somehow.  
<br /><br />Somebody said all the philosophers (thinkers) should be at the top and all the workers at the bottom (cruel, but that's how it is today).  My question is, how much do I have to think before I can get to the top?  I always knew my thoughts were precious and didn't throw them out, but I think I will personally be happier if I put them into a dumpster where people dig through and maybe are inspired by what I thought.  I'm not really into their system where the thinkers are at the top, as they squash all the workers together to cause diseases to accumulate more and ill health.  I think that &quot;the bottom class&quot; should be happy too and not have to die faster, only breed slower (and the top class too, so numbers stay the same and all have their cake and eat it too).  But people should be shown an equal chance to live and think and work and more cities should be built with everybody owning some form of garden so they know how to take care of life (minimum of one food plant).  Every building should have a lawn or a garden.  Rich people at the top can pay working people to take care of it.  The lawn on high rise buildings should be on the roof, yep right around those satellite dishes and under the tanning chairs.  Cities should be built under the sea, away from the fault lines and hot spots, with an air dome.  there should be a system which gets the sunlight to them and any bottom trolling or boats interfering with the cities should be illegal with a high fine.  the city should have imported soil and plants which are proven to be able to flourish.  There should be a system which filtrates and purifies the ocean water.  There should be submarines importing all foods which the area cannot create for itself.  It should have a countryside with grass, soil, and farmed free-range animals.  It should be a pleasant place to live with space for people, an amusement park, a Church, a travel port, travel services, everything needed.  Etcetera.  Also, if this goes successfully, we should think about building colonies on the moon and mars, using bullet proof glass and titanium for the structures and importing purified ocean water.  We should be spending our billions of dollars on these things instead of war and sex and drugs and rock 'n roll and abortificant contraceptives.  People should be taught for population's sake not to have sex with anybody but their married partners and to only have one each (unless they already are married to more).  Ministers in Churches should only have one wife so as to set a good example of how to live a simple and unselfish life.  contraceptives which don't have a 100 percent success rate should be taken off the market.  And tobbacco fields should be reduced in size to make room for health crops.  also, alcohol should be decreased in production, being majorly replaced with apple or berry juices which look a similar color to the alcholic beverages.  Coca Cola company should produce healthy flavours which are easy to make.  The healthy alternatives should be advertized with the same propaganda that got people hooked on the not so health addictions.  Tar should be illegal in all smoking products as it does damage to lungs.  People should smoke Herb-a-rettes (herbs wrapped in paper which you burn and inhale like a cigarette).  Forget sueing the tobacco company.  Put a law on them saying they're only allowed 10 percent nicotine and tobacco products with no tar and they must produce Herb-a-rettes.  Then they can still get rich because people will buy healty alternatives and they can still put a heathy enough level of nicotine in them.  That's enough thinking for one day, I've got work to do and friends to hang out with.

To where?  New Zealand, the humble nation where I live.  Actually, they're not so humble:  they call Australia an island, when about 28 of their 2-island country could fit in Australia's land-mass.  And there's a T-shirt that says, Whenever a Kiwi comes to Australia, it boosts the country's IQ 2 percent.  Mind you, New Zealand has a case of sibling rivalry or cousin rivalry with Australia.  The Australians seem like nice enough people, I've never been there yet.  And the weather there is really hot, extremely hot, compared to New Zealand.  New Zealand has nice weather in the summertime, and cold weather in the winter.  New Zealand, unlike America, simply asked for a little independence from England and is still under the queen.  The rebels that fled are in America, who I'm not proudly descended from.  The convicts were sent to Australia.  And people with mental illness were sent to New Zealand.  New Zealanders are doing pretty good for themselves with a Kiwi-can-do attitude.  Not everybody's mentally ill in New Zealand, but we show respect to those who are, knowing it can happen to anybody.  I fell to mental illness when I was 15 yrs old, and I'm American, so there you go.  New Zealand as a country has a lot of natural beauty and blessings.  And we did a better job with New Zealand than in America.  We share a lot more of the land, perportionately, with the native people, the Maori, than my rebel ancestors did with the Native Americans, so I'm happier with New Zealand than I am with America (America just slaughtered the natives for the most part and I read somewhere in the Bible about establishing a land on bloodshed being bad, and that scared me, -Woe to- It said!)
<br /><br />Anyways, back to the present.  I have a bunk bed space besides my normal bed, and that had stuff in it.  So I had to clear the space out and put the stuff in a drawer, under my other bed.  My room, I still don't feel is functional, but it will suffice.  I vacuumed the floor for the transferring of my stuff, so it would wait on a clean floor.  I did my immediate laundry so as to clear the floor for vacuuming.  I might never make the bed, then again I might.  and away we go.  I bought and saved some jelly bellies (like jelly beans but smaller and tastier) and some of my other candy which my mom bought me.  I still might have to clear off my desk also and put my old shoes away.  She's getting me new shoes.  I need to top up credit on my phone after I visit my friend so as not to be asked to borrow credit hopefully.  And we need to get my mom a SIM card for her temporary phone that she might use.  My phone, when in the States, costed money to be on!  We plan on making a Father's Day Card for my dad and maybe getting him a present.  
<br /><br />There's heaps of places to see in New Zealand, and my mom might want to see some.  Also, I want my mother to see all the Churches I go to.  It'll be great either way.  And she only stays for 2 weeks, so we'll hopefully make the most of it.  See what The Lord Wills, if she even makes it here.  But if He does, it'll be cool!

I want to say how are you doing and learn how they are.  Then I want to say you're doing great, keep going at whatever you're doing.  I pray for you.  And I want to be a short-term missionary.  Then when I retire, I want to be a long-term missionary, go live in Africa somewhere and get children job schools with optional Christian Teaching from the Bible every night.  And I want to be married, I've got a boyfriend.  He can help me raise children in Africa one day.  Hopefully he's flexible for my dreams or will be in time, as I've prayed for my husband to be flexible for my dreams.
<br /><br />But first I've gotta get my mental health in check.  Then I've got to go to animation school.  Then I've got to get employed somewhere to accumulate money for my dreams while paying off my debt from study.  Then I've got to get a trustworthy agent to help me manage my talents.  Plus, I've gotta take singing lessons to do the best with my voice.  There's a lot I've gotta get done.

I hated her… She was such an embarrassment. She cooked for students and teachers to support the family. There was this one day during elementary school where my mom came to
<br />say hello to me. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I ignored her, threw her a hateful look
<br />and ran out. The next day at school one of my classmates said, eee, your mom only has one eye!
<br /><br />I wanted to bury myself. I also wanted my mom to just disappear. I confronted her that day and said, If you’re only gonna make me a laughing stock, why don’t you just die?’
<br />My mom did not respond… I didn’t even stop to think for a second about what I had said, because I was full of anger. I was obivious to her feelings.
<br />I wanted move out of that house, and have nothing to do with her. So I studied real hard, got a chance to go abroad and study.
<br />Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. I had kids of my own.
<br /><br />I was happy with my life, my kids and the comforts.
<br />Then one day, my Mother came to visit me. She hadn’t seen me in years and she didn’t even meet her grandchildren.
<br />When she stood by the door, my children laughed at her, and I yelled at her for coming over uninvited. I screamed at her, How dare you come to my house and scare my children!
<br /><br />GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!
<br /><br />And to this, my mother quietly answered, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,’ and she disappeared out of sight.
<br /><br />One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. So I lied to my wife that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went to the old shack just out of curiosity.
<br />My neighbors said that she died. I did not shed a single tear. They handed me a letter that she had wanted me to have.
<br /><br />*******
<br />My dearest son,
<br /><br />I think of you all the time. I’m sorry that I came to your house and scared your children.
<br />I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I may not be able to even get out of bed to see you.
<br />I’m sorry that I was a constant embarrassment to you when you were growing up.
<br />You see……..when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye.
<br />As a mother, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with one eye. So I gave you mine.
<br />I was so proud of my son who was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye.
<br /><br />With all my love to you,
<br />Your mother.

It was my dad's idea.  So we use my money from my nana passing away and some of the money my mom gave me to buy a super-computer, a desktop.  I get given free software from a friend of my dad, he's charging me no royalties.  And I learn how to use them to make animations and film clips to put up on youtube and to eventually sell.  I just have to story-board a couple of good ideas, work the software, and learn business skills.  my computer comes in 2 days, the rule for it is no chatting online with it.  It goes into my art studio, I think.  In the meantime, I am meant to go to my Church and ask where they got their animation which they used for We Wish You A Merry Christmas tomorrow morning.  I plan on going early, but I seem to be going to sleep really late.  I just popped in half a sleeping pill some minutes ago, then got hungry for a snack, then got thirsty for a tea.  Chamomile Tea, caffeine-free, not that caffeine really effects me (too much makes my tongue go yellow).  I'm listening to my music and writing my blog.  I'm trying to memorize the whole Holy Bible, so what I've started to do is memorize how many Verses are in each Chapter.  I've already memorized how many Chapters are in each Book and the Books in their order.  Genesis 1 has 31, 2 - 25, 3 - 24, 4 - 26, 5 - 32, 6 - 22, 7 - 24, 8 - 22, 9 - 29, 10 - 32, 11 - 32, 12 - 20, 13 - 18, 14 - 24, 15 - 21, 16 - 16, 17 - 27, 18 - 33, 19 - 38, 20 - 18.  30 more Chapters to go with that One.  Exodus Chapter 1 has 22 Verses.  Hebrews Chapter 13 has 25 Verses just like Philemon's 1 Chapter in the Book before Hebrews.  2 John has 13 Verses in Its 1 Chapter, 3 John's Chapter has 14 Verses.  And 1 Timothy Chapter 6 and Revelation Chapter 22 both have 21 Verses each.  I typed almost from memory, so my memory is healing, progress eh?  cool.  I hope my life works out and I help other people along the way... I hope this blog is helpful...

My mother was trying to fix the situation and managing the best she could, and she couldn't fix the situation.  They were in California when I was born.  When I was 2 yrs old, they split up for the second time, this time not to come back together again.  My dad divorced my mother when I was 4 yrs old.  My dad moved out of our beautiful house in Anaheim.  My mother and I moved into an apartment and left our family cat, percussion, behind.  I kept getting transferred from one preschool to another because of my bad behavior.  I only changed kindergartens once.  I changed to a Lutheran school, then to another Lutheran school for first grade.
<br /><br />When I was 7 years old, I became a Christian, saying a Prayer.  I stayed in the Lutheran school one more year.  In third grade, I got transferred to a Presbyterian school for a year.  Then my mother's mother stopped funding her taking me to private schools and my mother and I got kicked out of our apartment.  My whole life changed.  I stayed with my dad's mother more and watched more television and ate more junk food.  In fourth grade, in the public school system, the teachers discovered that I was very smart, so I needed to be transferred into a school with a program for smart kids.  My first new school in fifth grade was good academically but I had no friends, only enemies, and even the teacher didn't like me.  So that same year, I got transferred to the only other school that had a smart kids program in my area.  While there I made few friends and I got more enemies.  In 6th grade, one of my other enemies from the first smart school got transferred over to this new school.  Also, I got cursed for what's so far been the rest of my life.
<br /><br />I got transferred yet again when I changed to intermediate grades 7 and 8. I stayed in for all of 7th grade and in the middle of 8th grade, I moved to New Zealand.  I never learned about the presidents of the United States of America.  I went immediately to the start of the equivalent of 9th grade within 2 weeks of moving to this new country.  I finished 9th grade at the high school.  I got taken out in 10th grade for homeschooling.  I went back to the States for half a year, and while there was declared truant and put into continuation school.  I officially passed 10th grade and went back to New Zealand, and got a part time job.  I stopped getting given hours at my job so I quit and by this time I was seeing things that other people didn't, so my dad took me to a psychologist.  after a while, my dad found students from Lifeway College and thought that might be a good idea for my next study.  But first he enrolled me into a tertiary art institution where I learned sculpting, video-making and photograph-developing and more but acquired a debt.  I owed now the government $16,144.00 (I only payed a little of it off).  Then I went to a government funded agency and asked about the monetary benefit for people who had studied art; they said art wasn't practical and after my dad argued with them, they put me on a job-training course.  From there I got a serious part time job which paid me over $50 extra a week.  But as part of my Future Direction Plan I had done at the course, I went to Lifeway for a year.  I acquired a certificate in Evangelism and another one in Christian Ministry but they didn't want me to come back as I had needed a lot of their help to complete the first year.  My psychological condition was worsening so my dad took me to a psychological team again, but a different one.  The psychiatrist diagnosed me with schitzophrenia and my life went on hold with internet access there more than ever for the last nearly 2 years.  I accumulated more music and more stuff and my pan.netaccount in this time.  My fitness went way down and my weight went up about 20 kg and then down nearly 10 kg and now has been slowly going up.
<br /><br />Now, this year, I plan on doing sort of home school and learning animation and business at home and hopefully getting a self-employed job position.  We're buying me a powerful computer that I plan on putting in my art studio.  And in the future I want to travel to other countries.  Hopefully as I go through, more people will know Jesus.
<br /><br />That's my life so far, in a nutshell.

<br />Is communism good?  In every communist country I know of, there’s torture, just like in every muslim country I know of with sharia law, there’s oppression of women to the max and even sometimes terrorist bombings.  If you give me the choice between a communist country or a muslim country and you say, Which is good? I will say the communist country because they do have good points and there aren’t terrorist bombings.  But compared to Christianity, communism is not good.
<br />Why would I say Christianity is better when America, a supposed Christian country is so bad?  Because the true Teaching of Christianity, when people try it, works better.  Communism was designed to be good, but when people try it, they fail.  Every country where communism is, there are corrupt leaders and the people get oppressed.  Every country where all the people try Christianity is successful.  That’s because everyone who tries something with Jesus’s Help succeed.  Communism, however, is tried in one’s own strength and proves impossible.
<br />So what’s wrong with torture?  It hurts not only the ones it’s done to but the ones doing it and also the community.  The ones doing it have the trauma of the blood stains and the trauma of the screaming of their victims plus an at least question in their conscience.  The community suffers being empathetic, from the screams, and from the fear that each one of them could be next.  Fear in itself is a form of torture, as it puts the body through stress and could cause illness if left unchecked.  It causes mental suffering also.
<br />Christians are successful in countries where they are beaten for it.  And everyone they spread their success to is also successful in those countries where they will get beaten for it.  But Christianity is enough to take on the Juch’e in North Korea, which even communism doesn’t dare take on.  North Korea is starving, starving for attention, starving literally for food.  Christians are in North Korea, doing what?  Feeding the starving children because they feel sorry for them, because they have something the Juch’e doesn’t have:  a love for every human being on the planet.  Perfect communism might have this but is unachievable, where as true Christianity is achievable.  God’s Love, not just any love.  God love us His Children like the Apple of His Eye, and He wouldn’t let anything happen to us that He wouldn’t let happen to the Apple of His Eye.  But there’s something you have to understand about God:  He’s tough, very tough, and He’s very patient with us human beings.  Every time you torture of the Christians, you hurt God, but you don’t know it, or you don’t know better, so He’s patient with you.  And we must be patient too.  He loves you, even if you’re torturing one of God’s Children, and He wants you to come back to Him and love Him too.  God accepts each human as they are on earth, and He wants them to accept Him so they will come with Him to His Heaven.  But not everybody’s going to accept God’s Love and His Ways because there are many things on the earth which distract people from God.  Some people are scared of losing their distractions and will fight violently to defend them.  Communism seems to be that way, and islam so that’s why many Christians trying to introduce the Way of God and His Love are met with suffering.  We just have to be patient and prayerful…
