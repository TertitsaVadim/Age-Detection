<br />You got mine,
<br />I'll help you outAnytime.
<br />To see you hurt
<br />To see you cry,
<br />Makes me weep
<br />And wanna die.
<br />And if you agreeTo never fight,
<br />It wouldn't matter
<br />Who's wrong or right.
<br />If a broken heart 
<br />Needs a mend,
<br />I'll be right there
<br />To the end.

You put himoff for a while searching for an excuse, but herefuses to be swayed as heapproaches you. He asks if you're afraid and youshake your head bravely.He has had more experience, but it's the firsttime his finger has foundthe right place. He probes deeply and you shiver;your body tenses; buthe's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looksdeeply within your eyesand tells you to trust him - he's done this manytimes before. His coolsmile relaxes you and you open wider to give him;more room for an easyentrance.You begin to plead and beg him to hurry,but he slowly takes histime, wanting to cause you as little pain aspossible. As he presses;closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue giveway; pain surges throughoutyour body and you feel the slight trickle ofblood as he continues. Helooks at you concerned and asks you if it's toopainful.Your eyes arefilled with tears but you shake your head and nodfor him to go on. Hebegins going in and out with skill but you arenow too numb to feel himwithin you. After a few moments, you feelsomething bursting within you andhe pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad tohave it over. He looksat you and smiling warmly, tells you, with achuckle; that you have beenhis most stubborn yet most rewarding experience.You smile and thank yourdentist. After all,it was your first time to havea tooth pulled.
<br />Naughty!
