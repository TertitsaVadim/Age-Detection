It is the “go to” dress whenever she has an event to go to where she needs something that fits her just right and that boosts her confidence. If you do not currently have a LBD that you truly love, then perhaps you need to find one that fits your shape and style a little bit better. It will be able to help you look great and feel completely fabulous!
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9saXR0bGVfYmxhY2tfZHJlc3MuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/183985536_8219781_49321747.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />LITTLE BLACK DRESS FOR BOY SHAPE: If you have a body that lacks some curves, is very athletic built and have a long torso with no definition in your waist, then you need a dress that will fix that. Get a little black dress that will give the illusion that you have a cinched waist such as one that has a tie or a belt along the waist.
<br /><br />LITTLE BLACK DRESS FOR A CURVY WOMAN: If you are a woman who is blessed with curves all over then you need a dress that is fitted with a v-neck. This shouldn’t be overly tight, but fitted nicely so that the dress hugs your curves just right.
<br /><br />LITTLE BLACK DRESS FOR TOP HEAVY SHAPE: If you have a large bust, you don’t want to cover it up completely but you don’t want to be falling out of your dress either. Stay away from plunging necklines and instead stick with a box or high neckline. You can wear a little black dress that has a flowing skirt instead of just being straight. This will give the illusion that both your top and bottom are equally proportioned.
<br /><br />LITTLE BLACK DRESS FOR TUMMY CONTROL: If you need to try and hide your tummy, then you need a dress that will give the illusion of a small and flat stomach. Pick a dress with an empire waist because it will bring emphasis on the bust and neckline and is not tightly fitted on the tummy.

Dresses designed to look conservative can look too sexy, or cleavage can overflow and look inappropriate. Some types of short little black dresses, such as halter style, may do nothing but emphasize your bust and call more attention to it. So choosing a short little black dress to flatter their figure is sometimes a challenge. Use these tips to play up your assets without drawing unnecessary attention to your bust.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/183985536_5218551_49333332.jpg" />
<br /><br /><strong>V-Neck</strong>: Choose a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9zaG9ydF9ibGFja19kcmVzcy5odG1s" target="_blank">short little black dress</a> with a v-neck for a flattering look. The v-neck will lengthen your neck and complement your bust. A v-neck can actually minimize a bust, especially if the dress is a darker color. Some v-necks may be lower and provide more cleavage than you want to show, and in that case you can layer the v-neck with a thin camisole underneath the the dress. 
<br /><br /><strong>Scoop Neck</strong>: A scoop neck works the same way as a v-neck. It draws the attention of the eyes up and away from a large bust. Stay away from turtlenecks, always opt for a flattering neckline such as the scoop or v-necks. Scoop necks are often seen on empire dresses, which are loose on the bottom and tighter on the top. If you want to add a more tailored look to an empire dress, belt it in at the waist for a more flattering silhouette.
<br /><br /><strong>Wrap Short Little Black Dress</strong>: A wrap <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9zaG9ydF9ibGFja19kcmVzcy5odG1s" target="_blank">short black dress</a> works because it creates a slim waistline, which balances out a larger bust and creates an hourglass shape. Wrap dresses, made of lightweight jersey material, can look even better because of the way the material drapes over your body. Because wrap dresses are typically v-necks, the dress provides the bust minimization and since they are belted your waist can be tied in to fit you perfectly. 
<br /><br /><strong>Form Fitting</strong>: It is the most unflattering choice to grab something big and baggy to hide your body when you are big busted. Go with your curves, not against them. Choose short little black dresses that are form fitting and tighter as opposed to loose and big all over. Even if you are plus size, a form fitting dress will highlight your curves and hide the bad spots.

<br /><br />Yeah, it’s multi-tasking journalist and France’s new First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler. She is our spanking fresh style obsession – and not just because she gave us a sexy flash of her toned thigh at this Presidential inauguration.
<br /><br />Setting the fashion tone for her Premiere Dame tenure, Ms Trierweiler – Francois Hollande’s partner of 7 years – stepped out in an elegant monochromatic look for the Elysee ceremony. Pairing a chic white day coat with a flattering short little black dress, the coiffed incumbent first lady outshone former supermodel Carla Bruni whose unflattering pinstripe suit and matching barely there makeup marked the end of her time in the political spotlight with more of a whimper than a bang.

<br /><br /><strong>Jewelry</strong>?The jewelry is always an eye-catching accessories like pearl necklaces and large earrings. The dress is definitely the perfect backdrop for displaying your favorite jewelry. Pearls, diamonds, platinum jewelry are common to accessorize the gown.
<br /><strong>Belts</strong>? An evening belt with a diamond studded buckle looks extremely simple as well as clean which doesn’t sidetrack from the line of the dress and proceeds to be an accent. You can consider your belt as an accessory or a jewel where you do not require anything else to do with it. If you wish to brighten it up then nothing works better than a tint of color of the bright satin bag. This looks extremely brilliant that helps in popping up everything out of the dress which can completely alter the appearance of the dress.
<br /><strong>Bags</strong>?The bags are also on the list of accessories for long black evening dress. If you go to a celebration of fashion, a clutch decorated with pearls is a good choice. If you go to meet daily, a handbag red or white can work well your dress. After all, the bags must also respond to your shoes. Anyway, you should attach great importance to the harmony of the whole. It is strongly recommended that you look in the mirror before leaving and make sure that all is well on your body.
<br /><strong>Makeup and Shoes</strong>? Wearing makeup can make you fall prey for another fashion disaster. Light or minimal makeup like eye shadow, lipstick and blusher are good to accomplish the perfect look with your black dress. A well placed hat as well is simply remarkable for few intensely formal gala or in pleasant days. The right pair of footwear is equally important just as the right sort of dress is. Look for stilettos that look simple but sophisticated and you are all set to go.

It can simply mean sealing a guy’s desire for you, and can be a good way to keep a man (not just get one).
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9sb25nX2JsYWNrX2RyZXNzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/183985536_10223214_49384412.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />1. Make him feel appreciated. In studies about why men cheat on their wives, it was found that the reason isn’t sex or attraction; it’s usually that they feel emotionally disconnected from their wives because they feel unappreciated, and they’re drawn to other women who make them feel appreciated.
<br />2. Let him help you. You don’t have to play the damsel in distress, but you don’t have to go out of your way to prove you can do everything yourself, either. Most guys already know that you’re a perfectly capable human being. So, ask him for his advice on something. Ask him to teach you about one of his interests. Ask him to do something for you that’s easier for him. 
<br />3. Be yourself. No, really. Men are thought to instinctively crave variety. By developing a strong sense of self, with your own distinct personality and flair, you’re appealing to his desire for variety because you’re so different.
<br />4. Flirt. Be playful.
<br />5. Play Hard to Get. Make him feel like you really want him, but are “holding back” for one reason or another. 
<br />6. Touch him subtly. Look for opportunities to brush your body past him, or to brush your arm past his. When you thank him for something he’s done, gently rest your hand on his arm while you’re talking. If you’re feeling daring, play footsie.
<br /><strong>Tips:</strong>
<br />• Keep in mind that sexy appearance is an almost negligible aspect of seduction. Many of history’s seductresses were very sexily dressed, but many men have strayed from their relationships to be with a woman who is considered to be more fascinating by wearing <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9sb25nX2JsYWNrX2RyZXNzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">long black evening dress</a>, whom, is considered to be a elegant evil to arouse their primary lusts.
<br />• Get alone together. If you can, make sure as few people as possible see you together because that will look a little fishy.
<br />• Most of the advice in the following column is not for making a guy fall in love with you, it’s for making a guy fall in lust with you.
<br />• Wear a light attractive scent. This means layering scents. Bathe in scented bath oils first. Then apply a light powder in the same scent. Finally spray the same scented perfume in front of you and walk into the mist. Do this about 45 minutes before you see him. If you overpower him with your scent, instead of wanting to edge a bit closer he will be running for the nearest exit.

<br /> The easiest way to balance a bottom-heavy figure is to choose a little black dress that skims over the lower half of the body, while showing off the waist. A fitted halter or strapless silhouette -- which accents a trim upper body -- is very flattering for bottom-heavy figures.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9nYXV6ZS10d29waWVjZS1zcGFnaGV0dGktc3RyYXBzLWJsYWNrLWRyZXNzLXAtNTIuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/183985536_15954712_49491209.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />Flabby Arms
<br /> Don't worry: you don't have to look matronly to cover up flabby arms. The trick is to keep the sexy element with embellishment or peekaboo cutouts on the little black dress. This sheer-sleeve <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9ibGFja19mb3JtYWxfZHJlc3Nlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">black formal dress</a> is another great way to get some sex appeal and still conceal arms.

What to wear is the most important question when ladies received the invitation because it not only helps to show yourself, but also a chance to express your respect and thanks to the host. But which style is the best one? The most important thing that ladies should opt for in an event is <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibGFja2RyZXNzZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9ibGFja19mb3JtYWxfZHJlc3Nlcy5odG1s" target="_blank">black formal dresses</a>.

<br /><br />It is universally known that black is the color that will never be out of date, so choose a black formal dress will never go wrong. Elegant, sexy and graceful, all good words that you can imagine are right for black. Just choose a black formal dress and participate your event with it. There is also some tips that you should consider.
<br /><br />The one thing is the fabric. Choose a good and comfortable fabric is quite important. It is better to choose a soft fabric that makes you move and walk freely, such as chiffon. Chiffon is one of the most popular fabrics and the first choice for girls because it is very comfortable and cool in summer. It is a very thin silk and you can see through. So opting for a black chiffon formal dress maybe is a good idea.
<br /><br />The other thing you should consider is the style and your body figure. You should choose the one that suits your body type perfectly. If you want to show taller and more slender, a black a line formal dress with empire waist is a good choice. Black is the color that makes you appear thinner, and A-line style will flatter your body figure perfectly. If you are curvy but not full figured, close-fitting formal black dresses may be nice for you as they help to show off your best asset. Or you may choose short styles if you want to appear cute and lovable.
<br /><br />All in all, what you choose should match with your body shape and the whole atmosphere of the occasion. Do not forget to choose some simple but shiny accessories, and you will be the belle of the night due to the simple but also elegant look. You should also keep confidence no matter what style you wear. Remember that you are the best one when you think you are the best.
