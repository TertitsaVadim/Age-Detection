Found below the surface covering the Williston Basin in Montana, North Dakota, and the Canadian Provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the Bakken Formation is considered by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the largest continuous oil shale deposit in the country (Pollastro, et.al, 2008).<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bakkenoil.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakkenoil.org</a> <br /><br />The Bakken Formation is 11,000 feet deep in the depocenter, a site of maximum deposition, of the basin in the southwest corner of North Dakota. It goes down to a depth of 4,500 feet on the eastern edge of the basin, and up to 3,100 feet (950 meters) below on the northern edge, across the Canadian border. The formation comprises three members, namely: upper member, a 23-foot thick black marine shale; the middle member, an 85-foot, thick inter-bed layer of limestone, siltstone, dolomite and sandstone; as well as the lower member, a 50-foot thick black marine shale. (Grape, 2006). <br /><br />The oil shale rich sedimentary rocks found in the Bakken Formation were deposited during the Upper Devonian and Lower Mississippian Periods, some 350 to 417 million years ago (Grape, 2006). It was discovered by Geologist J.W. Nordquist in 1953, and named it after the owner of the Montana Farm, Henry Bakken, where he drilled the first well (Langton, 2008). <br /><br />The oil shale deposits found in the Bakken Formation is the focus of so much attention and interest these days. They contain unconventional continuous-type oil resources, and to quote snopes.com, they are light sweet oil and, ‘will cost only $16 dollars a barrel’. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), based on the draft study paper of the late Dr. Leigh Price in 2000, it is estimated that from 271 to 503 billion barrels of oil, with mean of 413 billion, can be found in the Bakken Formation. It is estimated that three to 50 percent of it is recoverable by available technology (Langton, 2008). <br /><br />Oil shale, used as a lithologic term, is in reality an economic term that refers to the capacity of the rock to yield oil. The oil shale is a sedimentary rock that contains solid combustible matter, called kerogen, in a mineral matrix. Kerogen is largely insoluble in petroleum solvents, but when heated decomposes to yield oil. <br /><br />In the early years, the extraction of oil from kerogen is not economically viable. Hence, production of oil from it was not pursued. The government took a fresh look into exploring these vast oil resources with the advent of new drilling and completion technologies in oil exploration and production. The continuously rising oil prices in the world market, and the lifting of the government ban for its exploration are moves toward tapping this potential oil source within the country.<br /><br />In 2008, the US Geology Survey estimates 3 to 4.3 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil in the Bakken Formation, with an average of 3.65 billion barrels.  This estimate is a 25-fold increase of the 1995 data. As science advances, and new technologies developed, these huge amounts of oil will be discovered and tapped. <br /><br />From 1953 to 2008, about 135 million barrels of oil were produced from Bakken Formation, 36 million of that was in 2008 alone. State statistics reveal that oil production from Bakken in North Dakota has steadily increased to 86 million barrels in 2010, from about 28 million barrels in 2008, and 50 million barrels in 2009. <br /><br />The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, in a press release on 19 May 2011, said “We must develop our resources armed with the best science available, and with wells drilled in the Bakken during the past three years, there is significant new geological information With ever-advancing production technologies, this could mean more oil could be potentially recovered from the formation.” (U.S. Department of Interior, 2011) <br /><br />Along this light, he announced that the U.S. Geological Survey will update its 2008 estimates of potentially recoverable oil in the country’s portion of the Bakken Formation, which is a important domestic petroleum resource situated in North Dakota and Montana. <br />Secretary Salazar, furthermore, noted that the Bakken Formation outputs an increasing amount of oil for domestic consumption, while providing increasing royalty to American Indian tribes and individual Indian mineral owners in North Dakota and Montana. <br />The U.S. Geological Survey assessment will take about two years to complete. The oil drilling and production in the Bakken Formation will continue, while the assessment study is ongoing. Will the Bakken Formation oil estimates in 2012 increase by 25-fold again? <br /><br />References: <br /><br />Grape, Steven G.  2006.  Technology-Based Oil and Natural Gas Plays: Shale Shock!

And while investing skills usually are not easy to grasp, they involve straightforward principles.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bakkenoil.org%2Fcategory%2Fbakken-oil-jobs"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bakkenoil.org/category/bakken-oil-jobs</a> <br /><br />Competence in most regions of life consists of learning to preserve extraneous activity and effort. If it's done right it seems simple and viewers often point out &quot;Well, I could accomplish that.&quot; Nevertheless the &quot;wanna be&quot; soon detects that it is less easy as it appears. Trading might be frustrating and also discouraging, when the market generally seems to get you lower and you feel as you will never understand it, remember Sean Connery's renowned line, &quot;Impossible, nevertheless doable.In .<br /><br />Too often, investors experience genuine highs along with real levels. While the cooperation is normal along with expected, huge swings will be the result of altering stride or perhaps technique unnecessarily. Finding your own stride as well as niche can definitely make the exchanging life additional consistent and also smooth and thus, profitable. Observing a few wonderful trading stocks instead of collecting all of the potential individuals from suggestions and reads begins to bombard a trader and also changes the particular rifle picture accuracy to some shotgun splatter.<br /><br />Thus, a while back a Trader Discuss Live education a student composed &quot;- the past 1 week of investing have been completely fantastic. We have confirmed once more the value of next just a few stocks and shares and getting to understand (as much as possible) their particular behavior. PD is among my in history favorites&quot;. She has been referring to a new principle that's trained in the actual Trader's Forge a pair of day trading camp out that I execute once a month. We advise pupils to build a well balanced of good stock trading and get to understand them. Decide on your favorite 6-10 as well as back buy and sell them consistently. Learn to identify the designs of habits. Does it act in comparable ways about earnings? Can it make thoroughly clean or poor turns? Does the unit use a tendency to put certain graph and or chart patterns? Inside doing so, you recruit a feel for participants who effect the investment and increase your chances for you to repeatedly faucet that share for design trades.<br /><br />The particular patterns all of us observe will be the behavior of individuals. Key Merchants are reaching various degrees of traders, broker agents, fund professionals and the general public. This throw of participants is unique inside each investment or gang of stocks, provides, commodities and so on. Hence, exclusive patterns build and that is the main element. Instead of bouncing around being a butterfly from tree to rose bush looking for a brand-new flower, you will find certain plants that retain producing over a regular routine.

A good deal of the actual GDP with this country will depend on selling your sizzle, not necessarily the meat. We hunt for the elixir of youth, the short-cut, and the border so to speak, but also in the end a single universal continuous remains. Doing work smart surpasses working hard. Along with the end, the special moment is usually seeking the key as well as core with the matter as well as developing a number of simple and specific skills.<br /><br />When you can find a part of good soil that can be harvested and collected over and over again, you will find one of the gems of exchanging. The secret of many millionaires will be finding a steady stream of recurring income. Patterns are available because people are generally creatures associated with habit as well as the market is simply people.
