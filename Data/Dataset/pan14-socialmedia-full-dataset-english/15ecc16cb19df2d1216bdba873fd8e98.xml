<br /><br />2.       Buy and use a paper cutter
<br />Identity thieves actually go through homeowner’s trash to acquire personal information. For you to put off these thieves objectives, feel Secure to cut any documents that have your social security number or other financial information, such as the bank account number of yours, credit card numbers and the like that can possibly give these people your personal identity. If you don’t have paper cutter make use of an alternative through burning these documents completely.
<br /><br />3.       Freeze your credit
<br />This is to hands off scammers from opening unauthorized accounts in your name or identity. Even if your state is one of the few that does not allow freeze, you can still freeze your files at some of the leading major credit bureaus out there.
<br /><br />4.       Make a Do-not-Call List
<br /><br />5.       Make a statement to block credit card offers
<br /><br />6.       Always put your Social Security card in a safe place
<br />When you renew your driver’s license, make sure the DMV does not use your Social Security number as your driver’s license number.
<br /><br />7.       Make use of a different email addresses
<br /> 8.     Use a separate email address
<br />This is when you post messages to any public forum, such as newsgroups and mailing lists. Make an email account for such private conversation purposes and for another for your public identity to put a stop to this growing identity theft. Never use your personal email address in public because you might receive a number of different spams. You can periodically check this email account to see what spam is and what isn’t. A bonus is that Yahoo’s spam blocker is better than those from most ISP’s! And your main personal email address won’t be as clogged with spam. Some ISP’s like AOL and BellSouth.net give you multiple email accounts free with your paid service.
<br />9.    Do not give any financial information
<br />Your money in the bank is the major goal of scammers. So when you are on the situation of asking somebody your financial account which reason is pleasing to the ear such as they are just to check your account and credit card number, specifically you social security number on the phone or online, unless you initiate the call and you know the organization you’re dealing with.
<br /><br />10.   Do not put an interest into such “win a vacation”
<br />Do not fill out the “win a vacation” and other promotions you see in stores and shopping malls. Upon writing or entertaining it can give you junk mailing list and guarantee calls from persistent, high-pressure salesmen.
<br /><br />11.   Do not make an advance copy of your driver’s license, telephone, or social security numbers on your checks.
<br /><br />12.   Report lost or stolen checks right away.
<br />The bank can block payment on the check numbers that are missing. Also, review new checks you receive, to make sure none has been stolen in transit.
<br />13.   Store new and cancelled checks, credit card statements, medical bills, anything with confidential information, in a safe place and cut or burn them when you are done with them.
<br />14.   Secure your Personal Identification Numbers of Pin Numbers for your ATM and credit cards, and do not write on                anything or keep your pins with your cards. You should also secure your ATM card and credit card receipts, for thieves might                    use it to have access on your accounts.
<br />15.   Use different cases in selecting Personal Identification Numbers for your ATM and credit cards, and passwords that                    allow you to access other accounts. Do not use birth dates, a part your Social Security number or driver’s license number,                            address, nor children’s or spouse names.
<br />16.   Make use of a good anti-virus software anti-adware software and a hardware firewall on your computer, and keep them up to            date. You need all three. Almost all modern Routers (Dlink, LinkSys, NetGear, Buffalo, Airlink, etc.) have a hardware firewall built              in. See the left side of this page for the current recommendation for ant-virus / anti-malware programs.
<br />17.   Don’t make an outgoing mail in your mailbox 
<br />          Drop it into a secure, official Postal Service collection box. Thieves may use your mail to steal your identity.
<br />18.    Report to the company immediately, if regular bills fail to reach you.
<br />Someone might give a false record of you and your family to divert your information to his or her address.
<br />19.    If your bills include suspicious charges, do not ignore it.
<br />Instead, investigate immediately to head off any possible fraud before it occurs.
<br />20.   Check your credit report every day.
<br />Federal laws enable you to acquire one form credit report from each of the 3 major credit reporting agencies per year.
<br />21.   Prefer to use disposable addresses
<br />There are services online; some are free like SneakMail that provides you disposable addresses that can be deleted if they begin to receive spam messages. The disposable email addresses forwards email to a real email address of yours, but the sender cannot see this. If you create a unique address for each email newsletter or forum you subscribe to you can get rid of the address is it gets too much spam and just start using another email address.
<br /><br />22.   Stop purchasing a product or render any services to any company that sends you spam.
<br />Do not even visit their sites or ask for more information. Always bare in mind that, since they send out millions of spam emails, they only need a tiny fraction of responses to be profitable.   And if that doesn’t convince you, consider this: the vast majority of spam “offers” are in fact scams.
<br /><br />23.   Filter your email program
<br />Outlook does this quite easily. When you open an email and realize that it is spam, just click on Actions then Create Rule, then select an appropriate action, such as “from” then click “Move e-mail to folder” and select the “Deleted Items” folder. That’s it!  You’ll never receive email from that particular address or subject again.
<br />Do not post your address in HTML format
<br />Otherwise you will be spammed, since address-harvesting spiders (programs) extract your email address from the website and add it to the spammer’s lists.  Instead use feedback forms through PHP, ASP, or JSP that hide the email address, OR post the email address as a GIF (image file).
<br />2.  Do not get so exited
<br />If someone emailed you or sends you message or acknowledgement that you win from lottery or any raffles from a “randomly selected from a database of email addresses.”Lastly, Multi-level marketing is a scam.

<br /><br />The Australian Crime Commission has estimated that 2600 Australians have lost more than $113 million due to investment fraud, in the last five years.
<br />The findings come in a new report, published yesterday, titled Serious and Organised Investment Fraud in Australia (PDF). The report was put together by Taskforce Galilee, a consortium of 19 government departments, including the Crime Commission, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Tax Office, the Department of Human Services and the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
<br />In addition to offers for shares in companies, the fraudsters offer green energy investments, new technology shares, lotteries and sweepstakes and foreign currency trading, among others.
<br />The report found that most of the operations targeting Australians were based overseas. Many were based in Asia, but were not run in Asia. Those who cold-called victims were generally Australia, English, Scottish, Kiwi or South African.
<br />The report stated that the fraudsters commonly used Voice-over-IP, email, phone, mobile phone or SMS to contact victims, and developed fake websites with log-ins that would displace fake balances, to keep the victim investing money in the scam.
<br />The victims tended to be male, aged over 35 years, but generally over 50. Small business owners, self-funded retirees and those who are socially isolated were common. The report said that Australian victims were found to be well-educated and computer literate.
<br />Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare said in a statement that people could be strung along for months before catching on.
<br />&quot;This is what happens. The criminal syndicate cold calls the investor, refers them to a flash website and sends them a brochure, promising strong investment returns. After taking their money, they string them along for months or even years, and then the money disappears,&quot; he said.
<br />&quot;People’s entire life savings are stolen by criminals, with the click of a mouse. This type of crime destroys wealth and destroys lives. It’s also very difficult to stop.&quot;
<br />He said that the number of those who had fallen victim to investment fraud could be much higher than the 2600 estimate, because people tend not to report the crime.
<br />In a press conference yesterday, Australian Crime Commission CEO John Lawler said telecommunications providers had a big role to play in helping to crack down on investment fraud.
<br />&quot;They become very, very important collaborators, particularly with the regulator. And we do have the telecommunications and the ISP associations engaged with this initiative as well,&quot; he said.
<br />&quot;There's a range of things they can do to help in a disruption context. And it becomes about alerting and warning, and when monies are to be sent, or whether we have companies that are identified as being involved in investment fraud that the actual victim is alerted to the fact that these are known to the authorities.&quot;

<br /><br />Egypt’s new president Mohamed Morsi is reconsidering the peace agreement with Israel and ties with Iran in an attempt to build a strategic balance in the region.
<br /><br />Morsi was quick to announce that all issues will be addressed by governmental bodies as he will not make decisions on his own, according to Springhill Group Home.
<br /><br />“Part of my agenda is the development of ties between Iran and Egypt that will create a strategic balance in the region.”
<br /><br />Morsi has convened with his advisors to form a new Cabinet prior to his swearing-in on Saturday as the first freely-elected leader. On the other hand, the defeated candidate Ahmed Shafik was found to have left the Egypt in the midst of mounting fraud charges against him since his time as the nation’s civil aviation minister.
<br /><br />The Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate has pledged to become a leader for all Egyptians.
<br /><br />“I will be a president for all Egyptians. I call on you, great people of Egypt… to strengthen our national unity — the only way out of these difficult times,” Morsi said hours following his being declared the new president.
<br /><br />Egypt has breathed a collected sigh of relief when the election and proclamation have finished without the feared bloodshed. Morsi’s triumph, also marking Egypt’s first fair and free election in the modern times, followed almost 2 years of political upheavel and civil unrest from Hosni Mubarak’s military-rule.
<br /><br />Britain, France, US and the European Union have deemed the democratic election and the winning civilian president as significant parts of Egypt’s history. The US in particular has encouraged Morsi to continue Egypt’s transition to democracy that began last year.
<br /><br />However, even if Morsi has already resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt when he was elected, Israel is still worried of him for his Islam affiliations that could possibly endanger the peace of the two neighboring nations. And although the foreign ministry of Iran has acknowledged Morsi’s win, there is no hint of diplomatic relationship resumption on their side.
<br /><br />A former head of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party and a former member of Egypt’s parliament won against Hosni Mubarak’s Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik by a 4% margin.

<br /><br />TELEGRAPH UK - Four pairs in the women’s doubles were disqualified from the Olympics for underperforming in the final group stages on Tuesday night as they deliberately tried to lose by spraying shots wide or into the net to secure an easier quarter-final draw. 
<br />The players, the Chinese world champions Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang, Greysia Poli and Meiliana Jauhari of Indonesia and two South Korean pairs, Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na, and Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min Jung, were jeered by the crowd. 
<br />The organising committee for the Games will not be offering refunds to spectators who attended on Tuesday evening, despite Lord Coe describing the incident as “depressing” and asking: “Who wants to sit through something like that?” 
<br />Officials from the sport’s governing body conducted a frantic round of meetings as they hastily arranged a disciplinary panel. 
<br />An official announcement of its findings was only made public as spectators took their seats for last night’s women’s doubles quarter-finals. Pairs from Canada, South Africa, Russia and Australia, who had thought their Olympics were over, had to hastily prepare for a return to court in front of a sell-out crowd. 
<br />“We found out we were playing at 3 o’clock,” said Michelle Edwards, of South Africa. “Everything was so last minute. We packed our bags, rush, rush, rush and here we are. The mental preparation was almost zero.” 
<br />South Africa lost 2-0 to Russia but Australia took Canada to three sets before losing. 
<br />The episode was deeply embarrassing for the badminton authorities who would have been aware that Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, recently described match fixing as the biggest threat to the Games. 
<br />With all athletes and coaches swearing to uphold the Olympic oath at the opening ceremony, this damaged the integrity of the Games. 
<br />The stakes were high for the badminton authorities with the prospect of two sports being removed from the Olympics before Rio 2016. 
<br />“We are very sorry this has happened,” said Thomas Lund, the chief operating officer of the badminton federation. “The most important thing is we dealt with the issue and did it in the best interests of the other players in this tournament.” 
<br />But while the administrators were lauding their disciplinary process the players were firmly pointing the finger at the sport’s authorities. The Daily Telegraph reported earlier this year they had been warned of manipulation when they changed the early stage of the Olympic competition to a round robin stage. 
<br />China has been accused of manipulating matches before but only ties involving two sets of their own players. This was more serious because it took place against a Korean pair. 
<br />“I have had volunteers really upset — they were crying because they couldn’t believe this was going on the Olympic Games,” said Gail Emms, the former British player who won silver in Athens. 
<br />“They have been working so hard to make this competition perfect and they have just seen four women’s doubles pairs not live up to what they believe in. There have been a lot of strong words.” 
<br />There was sympathy but also condemnation for the Chinese pair from their own countrymen. Lin Dan, the defending men’s singles Olympic champion, admitted Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang had discredited the sport. 
<br />“I think this is not in the Olympic spirit,” he said. 
<br />“To avoid this situation is very simple: just straight knock out.” 
<br />The scandal began when the Chinese top seeds Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang started to show little interest in beating the Koreans to finish top of Group A. By finishing second they would avoid compatriots and second seeds Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei at least until the final. 
<br />“What happened was just truly disgraceful,” said Emms. “This is the Olympic Games — it is not very much in the Olympic spirit.”

<br /><br />SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean fishing boats crossed the Koreas' tense western sea boundary and retreated soon after being warned Wednesday in the second such violation this year, South Korea said. No fighting erupted though the border is one the North has long refused to recognize.
<br /><br />A North Korean government boat briefly crossed the boundary while trying to guide the seven fishing boats back to North Korean-controlled waters, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity, citing office rules.
<br /><br />Later Wednesday, seven North Korean boats again violated the boundary, but they all sailed back after a warning was broadcast, the official said. It wasn't clear whether they were the same seven boats that earlier crossed.
<br /><br />Seoul says North Korean fishing boats last crossed in April. The disputed sea boundary is not clearly marked, and incursions by North Korean military and fishing boats are not unusual. Violence often erupts in the seafood-rich waters, and three naval clashes since 1999 have taken a few dozen lives.
<br /><br />After the Korean War ended nearly 60 years ago with a truce, not with a peace treaty, the U.S.-led U.N. Command divided the Yellow Sea without Pyongyang's consent. The boundary cut North Korea off from rich fishing waters, and Pyongyang has contested the line ever since.
<br /><br />North Korea shelled a front-line South Korean island near the boundary in November 2010, killing four people. Earlier in 2010, an explosion ripped apart a South Korean warship in the area, killing 46 sailors. Seoul said Pyongyang torpedoed the vessel. North Korea denies responsibility.

<br /><br />Guns don’t kill people; people kill people; and people with guns kill even more people. 
<br /><br />They also save more people who would otherwise be at the mercy of the criminals.
<br /><br />SPRINGHILL TOWNSHIP, Pa. — An 85-year-old great-grandmother in Fayette County busted a would-be burglar by pulling a gun, then forcing him to call for help while she kept him in her sights.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thepittsburghchannel.com%2Fnews%2F17232825%2Fdetail.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/17232825/detail.htm</a>…
<br /><br />Venus Ramey, 82, confronted a man on her farm in south-central Kentucky last week after she saw her dog run into a storage building where thieves had previously made off with old farm equipment.
<br /><br />Ramey said the man told her he would leave. “I said, ‘Oh, no you won’t,’ and I shot their tires so they couldn’t leave,” Ramey said.
<br /><br />She had to balance on her walker as she pulled out a snub-nosed .38-caliber handgun.
<br /><br />“I didn’t even think twice. I just went and did it,” she said. “If they’d even dared come close to me, they’d be 6 feet under by now.”
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fstory%2F0%2C2933%2C267540%2C00.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,267540,00.html</a>
<br /><br />Hancock County Sheriff’s Investigator Andre Fizer said about an 84-year-old man’s decision to shoot through a house door at another man who was trying to barge into the house: “You could tell he was devastated. You could tell he was scared.” And rightfully so. Twenty-year-old Wade Ledesma made repeated attempts to break in to the house at about 5 a.m. on July 27, threatening to kill him throughout.
<br /><br />Ledesma “tried to break through the front door and also tried to enter through a back door and a rear window of the residence. The resident called 911 and reported that the intruder was trying to force his way into the home…. [The elderly man] held himself against the door to keep [Ledesma] from entering,” reported the Sun Herald.
<br /><br />The resident became tired from holding the door and, worded about his and his wife’s safety, asked his wife to get his pistol. He fired a shot through the door, meant to merely be a warning shot, and he hit Ledesma in the leg.

<br /><br />Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition promises immediate relocation for the seniors nearby. However, most of the current elderly people living in the community are opposed to the plan even when the government tried its hard to make them see how a bigger place could benefit them.
<br /><br />They argued that it could potentially compromise their quality of life and that they are already satisfied with the current setup.
<br /><br />The planning commission of Half Moon Bay approved the plans to build more affordable houses for the elderly in that location amidst protests from the present occupants who don’t think the project will do them any good.
<br /><br />The project to broaden the senior community consists of having horseshoe pits, community rooms and bocce ball court. Contractors explained that the new houses would be spacious and pleasant – they will even have room for outdoor garden. The catch: only 45 apartments would be available by 2014.
<br /><br />Elderly residents fear that they might already have passed away before they get to return to the renovated senior community.
<br /><br />It’s true that people find it hard to make a change especially when they are already accustomed to the current environment, and this applies more to the elderly. When they have already settled in a place and have set their ways, they will not want to make a sacrifice to break the status quo. In fact, the seniors are worried about losing their homes.
<br /><br />According to officials, the new senior complex could slightly reduce the high demand for affordable housing for the elderly.
<br /><br />The project was approved just last week through a unanimous vote from the City Planning Commission. However, residents can still appeal to the Half Moon Bay City Council.

<br />This review is from: Springhill Vellum Bristol Gold 67# Cover 23&amp;quot;x35&amp;quot; 5 sheets/pkg (Office Product)
<br />The color is a little darker than on the picture - more orange than yellow, but still beautiful. It has a thinner texture than water color paper. The delivery took a little longer than I expected, so make sure you order in advance.
