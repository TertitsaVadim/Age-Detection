<br />And for my dad,I know that you are just making yourself strong even we all know,the rest of the family knows that anytime the Creator will take u back to His home
<br />I know that you suffered too much to provide the edcuation and responsibilities as a father.
<br />We are very grateful we have u as our father...
<br />I got only one wish to God,not wealth not having the good man for me but just to give you even one more year to be with us in this world

<br />We can always feel how reality bites and hurt you.
<br />The truth always prevail
<br />We must face the fact that we canot hide from the truth 
<br /><br />This world is full of misery,heartaches,it is only how you must accept the truth
<br />Yes it do hurts
<br />But we must accept it
<br /><br />If we had done wrong,be ready of its return
<br />Its this world,like hell if you dont know how to live good
<br />Its heaven if you know how to be contented and face the truth
<br /><br />The truth is everyone is only having fun,we sometimes are not ture to ourselves
<br />What more to other people?
<br /><br />I wanna escape from this world,the real world that i cannot live in
<br />I wanna go to an isolated place where I can be alone and no one is hurting me
<br /><br />But this is reality
<br />Everyone hurt you,play with you make fun of you
<br />This reality in this world is unacceptable
<br />But we must face it,we cannot escapre from reality
<br />Open our eyes and mind,this damn world we live in is both hell and heaven.

<br /><br />You can find it in a simple act of kindness toward someone who needs help.
<br /><br />There is no mistaking love. 
<br /><br />You feel it in your heart.
<br /><br />It is the common fiber of life, the flame of that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. 
<br /><br />It is our connection to God and to each other.

<br />The Universe is the way it is.
<br />So blind they are, as they try
<br />To answer these foolish questions.
<br /><br />Because it is not a question of &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;How?&quot;,
<br />But, rather, a question of &quot;Who?&quot;.
<br />So listen as I tell you now,
<br />About the mystery laid before me and you.
<br /><br />Who flung the planets far and wide,
<br />And made them each unique?
<br />Who constructed each being's mind,
<br />To love, or laugh, or teach?
<br /><br />Who taught the stars to shine,
<br />Like newly polished gems?
<br />Who made the very fabric of time,
<br />And can destroy it at His whim?
<br /><br />Who made a purpose to burn in us,
<br />And our soul to contain it?
<br />Who made a longingness for us,
<br />To want the knowledge of it?
<br /><br />Who paints each sunset with detail,
<br />And clothes each dawn in glory?
<br />Who taught each heart to sail,
<br />And chase hope like a quarry?
<br /><br />Who plotted each river's course,
<br />And every raindrop's journey?
<br />Who repels sorrow and remorse,
<br />And enjoys to make us happy?
<br /><br />Who made each tree from seed,
<br />And gave the wind its voice?
<br />Who made every heartbeat,
<br />Proudly rejoice?
<br /><br />Who filled the ocean with mysteries,
<br />And trimmed its waves with foam?
<br />Who has seen all the ages of history,
<br />But to some, still remains unknown?
<br /><br />Who made some land,
<br />Ripe with blizzards?
<br />Who spilled the sands,
<br />To make the desert?
<br /><br />Who sculpted the mountains,
<br />From top to foundation?
<br />Who made the roars of lions,
<br />To be filled with admiration?
<br /><br />Who draped the sky over the earth,
<br />Like a blanket over an infant?
<br />And, who made it so that every breath,
<br />Might be riddled with amazement?
<br /><br />Who thought out the vibrance of color,
<br />And the sensation of touch?
<br />Who knew that our planet, when compared to others,
<br />Would be filled with so much?
<br /><br />Who constructed the human body,
<br />And fathomed what it would be like?
<br />Who could find such variety,
<br />When it came to animals of different types?
<br /><br />Who taught the birds the secret of flight,
<br />And gave gravity its orders?
<br />Who shines light,
<br />Wherever darkness hovers?
<br /><br />Who made valleys and hills,
<br />To form out of the ground?
<br />Who gave the night air its chill,
<br />And the storm, its sound?
<br /><br />Who taught to tides to flow,
<br />And the fire to burn?
<br />Who made the lake, with a bed below,
<br />And showed the water how to churn?
<br /><br />So the answers you so sorely try,
<br />And are ambitious to pursue,
<br />Are folly; Because it's not a question
<br />Of &quot;How?&quot; or &quot;Why?&quot;,
<br />But a question of &quot;WHO?&quot;.

<br />listen to the echoes of our hearts. 
<br />We all fall in love and there are times
<br />when we love so much that we lose
<br />ourselves in our emotions.
<br /> More often than not, we wonder why there are love that grows, and love that grows cold.
<br />We would start to search for answers
<br />and try to find where love has gone
<br />wrong. 
<br />But in the end, we find ourselves where we started for we cannot question love when it has its own reasons. Love will always be as it
<br />always has been....silent, mysterious
<br />and deeply profound.
<br />Many of us believe that love is
<br />forever, that love never dies, only to
<br />be disillusioned in the end when we
<br />find our hands empty and our hearts
<br />longing. 
<br />We mistakenly have looked at
<br />love as a need to be fulfilled. But
<br />love is a gift given to us. 
<br />We should not hold it in our hands for we may
<br />never find the strength to let it go
<br />when it decides to leave.
<br /> We should only embrace its warmth and glow while it last and then freely open our arms
<br />when its time to say good-bye.
<br />When we fall in love, we don't want that feeling to end for it is everything we are, everything we wanted to be.
<br /> We pray that love will stay and
<br />grow in our hearts.
<br /> But if it doesn't then we should never let our lives be taken by it, for life should not end
<br />where heartaches begin.
<br />There is always a reason why we have to
<br />move on.
<br /> When we have to say good-bye
<br />to the feeling we wanted to stay
<br />forever, let us not wave our hands with
<br />a heavy heart. 
<br />For love will have to set its wings free and find the place where it belongs. We may have lost it but then again, when we close our eyes
<br />and listen to the echoes of our hearts,
<br />we will hear that feeling resounding
<br />silently forever.
<br />Then we'll know that love never left
<br />us, for the good that we have become
<br />because of love will always stay.
<br /> Love will always be there, reminding us that
<br />we should be thankful and happy not
<br />because we have lost love, but because,
<br />for once in our lives, that feeling
<br />called love lived in our hearts and
<br />made us happy.

<br />Do not think you are not that lucky
<br />Dont feel that you are the most miserable person in the world

<br />For the food we eat, the clothings we wear
<br />And for the people around 
<br />Who always have a smile for you
<br /><br />Count your blessings

<br />I dont know what i feel why i cried too much
<br />Maybe Im just too emotional
<br />Maybe Im just so depressed
<br />Maybe Im just crazy expecting too much
<br />Of things which I cannot have

<br />Of a relationship which I cannot handle
<br /><br />Or I just miss some people who are very close to my heart
<br />I always have these feelings which is just normal for a person like me
<br />Am I jealous with somebody?
<br />Or am I just longing for someone to hold my hand and lead me
<br />To the path where I must go
<br /><br />Not a strange feeling but I think Im just too weird...
<br />Crying without any reason
<br />I just wanna release the pain im having now

Facebook has been determined unacceptable for use for government business purposes, and as not being directly related to the workplace. As Facebook is growing in popularity, it’s seemingly reducing productivity for government employees! There’s a surprise. People at work, not working?
<br /><br />I’m unsure of other social networking sites that have been banned for Ontario government employees, so I’ll have to do a bit more digging. But I’m curious what the Province of Ontario plans on doing, with the increasing number of widgets and desktop applications that will soon render it unnecessary to open up the precise URL of a site to get the pertinent information? Employees banned from GMail can at least get a sneak peek at their inbox using a start page widget like those offered by Pageflakes.
