Working with Bottega Veneta in the past few weeks to bring you exclusive information on a product launch is not only exciting but something from our dreams. Known for its supple woven leather, Bottega Veneta has garnered a worldwide audience of fans. While their bags are stylish and on many must-have lists, one thing Bottega Veneta avoids is being known for seasonal trendy bags. 
<br />Today we are bringing 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWRhcmlhLmNvLnVrL21lbnMtYmFncy1icmllZmNhc2VzLWMtMTM3XzEzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">mulberry bags uk</a> you an exclusive product launch, a style from Bottega Veneta that you know well in a color that blends purple, taupe and pink perfectly. From the fall/winter 2009 line, the Bottega Veneta Lilac Campana symbolizes everything the brand is known for; beauty, timelessness, and impeccable craftsmanship. The shape of this bag seems light and feminine, just as the bag actually is. While the interior is roomy and has a cell phone holder and side zipped pocket, the size of the bag is not overwhelmingly large or underwhelmingly small. Touching this woven lambskin reels you in, as I have 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWRhcmlhLmNvLnVrL211bGJlcnJ5LWFsZXhhLWMtMTQwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">mulberry alexa bags</a> said time and time again Bottega Veneta picks the most amazing leathers and has the best implementation of weaving the leather together. 
<br />The next thing I must gush about is the color. The color is perfect. As I stated above it is a blend of purple, taupe, and pink. While they call it lilac I merely want to label it perfect. It brings a feminine touch without it being too light pink, which would show color easily. This color is wearable. Wearable in the summer, wearable in the fall, wearable in the winter, and wearable in the spring. For light pink colors I typically retire the bag for the fall and some of winter, but this color is again, perfect. 
<br />The Campana shape is a favorite of many Bottega Veneta lovers on the Purse Forum. The Veneta is a classic shape from BV, but the Campana adds a slight twist that I adore. There are double top handles and a magnetic enclosure on top which makes no hassle opening and closing of the bag. I always worry about shoulder bags being too snug on me, but this bag slid on my arm perfectly. 
<br />Most importantly, this bag is a staple piece to any collection. Shape and color is perfect, leather is divine, and overall product has me dreaming of the bag still. If you have been waiting for a piece from Bottega Veneta and want it to last you forever (literally), this can easily be the bag for you. Buy through Bottega Veneta for $1,980. This bag will be available at Bottega Veneta stores nationwide, or call 877.362.1715, or visit BottegaVeneta

<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bXVsYmVycnl1ay5jb20vcGViYmxlZC1taXR6eS1ob2JvLXRvdGUtYmFnLWJsYWNrLXAtMjI5My5odG1s" target="_blank">mulberry mitzy tote</a> kind of undecided here, PurseBloggers.  So here are my thoughts, I need you to help me make a decision.  The Derek Lam Romina Bag has some definite strong points.  
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bXVsYmVycnl1ay5jb20_" target="_blank">Mulberry bags</a> The leather is nice and smooth.  It has a cool chain strap (I love chain straps) that most bags of this shape dont have, and it also has a piece of leather attached to the chain to make it more comfortable to carry.  I generally enjoy grey as a color for bags, because I think that grey goes with more other colors than either black or brown.  The lining is pretty.  Something about this 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0bXVsYmVycnl1ay5jb20vdGlsbGllLXRvdGUtYmFncy1zb2Z0LW1hdHRlLW9hay1wLTIyOTAuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">mulberry tillie tote</a> bag, though, is making think eh. pass. Im not sure exactly what it iscould it be the seaming?  
<br />The bag might be a little TOO pieced together for my taste, and Im finding the lack of symmetry in the seaming a bit disconcerting.  Is that a pocket over there on that one side?  Im not sure.  It looks like one, but who knows.  One side of the front is also pleated, while the other is not, and the overall effect is just not doing anything for me.  I wont go so far as to say that its an affront to my sense of balancebut it sort of is.  And the leather, despite being smooth, doesnt look like it would be particularly soft.  Strike two.  Does anyone have a strike three? Buy through ShopBop for $1690.

Weve discussed previously that Kate Spade has recently taken on some new talent to right the ship, and while this seasons collection isnt amazing, they have certainly come a long way from their relatively uninspired past.
<br />If the Kate Spade Montclair Jacques 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5ZGFyaWEuY28udWs_" target="_blank">mulberry bags</a> Tote is a good representation of their new designers talent, then theyve got lots of positive things to come.  The things that strikes me the most about this bag is the apparent care and attention to detail that was taken when designing it.  The edges are precise and well-thought, the folding and layering deliberate and painstaking.  The contrasting paint that adorns the exposed leather edges gives 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5ZGFyaWEuY28udWs_" target="_blank">mulberry factory shop</a> the design a bit of depth and heft.  The overall effect is high-end and expensive-looking, which is exactly what Kate Spade had been missing for a while.  Keep turning out more bags like this, please! Buy through Nordstrom for $475.

Seriously, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5ZGFyaWEuY28udWs_" target="_blank">mulberry outlet</a> when I first saw the Kale Stella Shoulder Bag, I went huh?. Im pretty sure the issue I have is with the way the photograph was taken. I mean seriously people, handbags dont need to be contorted into shapes worthy of an Americas Next Top Model photo shoot. You cant make a handbag look fierce. It 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5ZGFyaWEuY28udWs_" target="_blank">mulberry bags</a> either is or it isnt. So, what do we think of this bag? As soon as I got over the sort of awkward picture, I really had to sit back and think about it for a bit. Now, to me, this is the first 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5ZGFyaWEuY28udWs_" target="_blank">mulberry factory shop</a> sign that I dont really like the bag that much. But, as I kept looking, I found myself actually kind of liking the bag a bit. It is different and fun. 
<br />I used to live in Washington, DC (for 3 years) and for those of you who live in cities where using mass transit is actually easy, you know what it is like to want a bag you can just throw over your shoulder, hop on the metro/subway and go. Im not sure I would use it as I headed off to work, but this bag could be perfect for a weekend of strolling around the city. I hated carrying big bulky bags on the metro because during heavy traffic times, as you run to catch the train, it isnt unheard of to get your bag caught in the doors as they close (Ive seen this happen way too often). But this fuchsia washed lambskin, accented with gunmetal hardware bag seems roomy enough for the essentials but small enough to keep close to your body. Now, speaking of fuchsia, is it a hot color right now or what? Dior came out with a pretty awesome bag in the same color. The Kale Stella Shoulder Bag has a magnetic-close front asymmetrical flap,is pleated in the front and rear of the bag and has fabulous suede lining. I feel like Ive been all over the place with this review, but, hey, it happens. Add to your collection through Bluefly for $285.

<br />If you hate bags like the Juicy Couture Black Star Satchel and wish theyd go away, blame Proenza Schouler for the astronomical success of the brands PS1 satchel. Since its debut, a passel of imitators both high-end and low have come along to give consumers a similar structure with a slightly different flair, and from that group has come some great bags, most notably the Mulberry Alexa. 
<br />I, on the other hand, adore these bags. Theyre roomy, functional and classic without being stuffy or dated, and the sub-$400 price point on this bag in particular makes it a good fit for women who want to get the look without shelling out a huge amount of money for the original. This bag is still unique enough that its nowhere near a direct copy, and thats

<br />Between these two colorways, I naturally gravitate toward the black-on-black option, which is another holdover from the wildly successful Proenza Schouler design. I think that the tonal hardware gives the bag a level of sophistication slightly above those with contrasting hardware, which is why the black PS1 has

You help yourself to a piece of the candy, unwrap the golden foil and place it on your tongue to savor the flavor.

Just as a foreigner may be reluctant to visit America when reading that everyone carries guns and there are no go ghettos full of gangs, most know the reality is a mixture of safety and possible danger, and thus it is with most foreign countries.
<br />International travel is an exciting adventurebut some safety issues are worth giving consideration to. It isnt really wise to arrive as the big American cheese flaunting wealth and expensive jewelry as you will already stand out as a foreigner and a target for the criminally inclined who like to snatch bags and steal passports for nefarious doings. Thus natural precautions should 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dG90ZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">my website</a> be taken not to flash rolls of notes, or carry ones passport on ones person. Instead carry smaller amounts of cash and lock the rest safely away along with your original passport. Carry a photocopy of important documents rather than leaving them unattended on foreign beaches. Most of the chancers who prey on tourists are found in the cities but good sense plays a part elsewhere too. Use a money belt 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dG90ZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">mulberry factory shop</a> rather than an easily pocket picked wallet. Women should beware of idly throwing their bags across the back of caf chairs or across their shoulders. It may not look fashionable but if you arein a known area of risk, wrap your bag strap over your chest and hold it close. No matter how much you are drawn to exotic hotspots such as Afghanistan and Iran you should be aware of the government guidelines on safety issues to this type of destination. They could well turn out to be safer than areas of South Africa which is run amok with crime these days yet still promotes itself as a holiday destination. The inherent dangers of running into a gun crazy opportunist whilst sitting waiting for the traffic lights to change, are much more likely in South Africa than running into gun yielding type in the Yemen. Women should exercise extra precaution as a pretty face, or even an old raddled one, may well attract the attentions of locals seeking a green card or a British passport. Its amazing to read of the number of attractive young men in countries such as Goa and Turkey who miraculously fall instantly in love with someone old enough to be their Granny, who then falls for the flattery and ends up financing the young mans lifestyle as well as becoming a local laughing stock. In many European countries the men are harmless flirts who take a natural interest in the fairer sex, but women should stick with a friend if not sure about male intentions. Be aware of traditional customs and dress accordingly so as not to offend local sensibilities. Many foreign men perceive Western women to be loose floosies, unlike their own women who are chaperoned virgins, so if you feel uncomfortable 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dG90ZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">mulberry factory shop</a> avoid making eye contact. These are just natural precautions which the international traveller should take, but really dont spoil the thoughts of your vacation with worrying about things which may not even be relevant. Read up in advance of any necessary areas to avoid just as visitors to your country should apprise themselves first of areas to avoid.

She had just celebrated her twenty first birthday and was on her way to a final term of a university course in English. On her lap lay a copy of Wuthering Heights which started to slip from her hands. 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dWstc2FsZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">mulberry uk</a> Suddenly it crashed to the floor falling with a thud. Her eyes flickered as she started to stir.
<br />  &quot;Is this yours? asked the lady opposite her.&quot;Yes, thanks!&quot; Jenny replied reaching out towards it.The old lady smiled and handed it back to her. She had a tweed suit on and wore gold rimmed spectacles. Next to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dWstc2FsZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">mulberry outlet</a> her lay a blue canvas bag which looked half empty. She nodded and carried on with her crossword.Two seats along lay a small boy across his mother's knees. His mother hummed quietly as the boy picked at the hem of her skirt. Soon the carriage scene became a blur and Jenny fell asleep. She woke suddenly to the guard shaking her violently.&quot;Are you going to get off here or not?&quot; he asked gruffly.&quot;Yes thanks,&quot; she muttered as she stumbled to her feet.&quot;Take your bag with you too!&quot; he added pointing

It was the old lady's.&quot;&quot;What old lady? There was no old lady on this carriage! Now stop joking around and take your bag!&quot; he ordered crossly.&quot;But.... it..&quot;&quot;Look I saw you with it this morning. Do you want me to report it as a suspected bomb and have you arrested?&quot;&quot;No, you must be right, sorry! I must have had too much champagne last night.&quot;The guard stamped off and left Jenny looking rather bewildered. Jenny went over to the bag and 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL211bGJlcnJ5dWstc2FsZS5jby51aw__" target="_blank">click here</a> unzipped it.
