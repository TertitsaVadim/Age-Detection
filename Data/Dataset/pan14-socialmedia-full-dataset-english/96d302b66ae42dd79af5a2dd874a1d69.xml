Use These Handy Tips To Create A Day To Rem<br/><br/>Weddings are happy and joyful times, both for couple and their loved ones. Apply these tips to every step of the planning process to ensure that you get the wedding you've always dreamed of.<br /><br />Using one credit card, with a liberal rewards program, can be a great way to keep wedding expenses in order and earn a bonus for doing so. Because of the cost involved, it pays to have something that pays you back. All of these charges add up quickly when paying for a wedding, allowing you to rack up some great rewards in the process.<br /><br />Tell the caterer that the reception is outdoors. Some foods will not keep well in the heat or might be too light to stay in dishes if the wind is blowing strongly. Using covers could make your caterer's job much easier. Perhaps a small fridge could be used to keep drinks chilled.<br /><br />The most important part of your wedding is your future spouse, so be sure that you are ready to spend the rest of your life with them. Don't make this choice in a hurry. Take care to consider the person's characteristics--both the things that you love about them and the aspects that are challenging.<br /><br />If you feel as though it is wasteful to pay hundreds of dollars for a cake that will have a lot left over, consider a smaller bakery to create a smaller cake that will cost less and be more personal. Many bakeries can provide wedding cupcakes that come in at 100 calories or less per serving. Other healthier options include gluten-free pastries, no-calorie sweeteners, and icing alternatives, such as meringue or fruit spreads.<br /><br />If you are going to have a destination wedding, give your guests a basket filled with exotic goodies. You will want to include useful items such as a disposable camera, tourist map that shows fun places in the local area, sunglasses and a hat. Additionally, you may want to include a local restaurant guide so that your guests know where to eat.<br /><br />Give your guests a schedule of events in order for all of your guests, including those from out-of-town, will know what events they should make time for and attend. Maintain an updated lists of all events, such as the rehearsal or a pre-wedding dinner, so your guests know exactly where they will be at all times.<br /><br />The groom must always make sure, prior to the wedding, that he has a tuxedo that fits properly. Consult with people whose opinions you trust before you make a final decision about your tux. You want to be looking your absolute best at your wedding, keep that in mind as you think about what tuxedo you want to be wearing.<br /><br />Potted plants in varying sizes can be placed throughout the reception and ceremony areas for a quick and affordable floral motif rather than using traditional flower arrangements. Plants in decorative glazed pots or terracotta tones will look great and save money. When the wedding is over, the bride and groom can plant them at their new home, or the guests can bring home as wedding favors.<br /><br />A wedding only needs a few things. The other things that go into the wedding are totally optional. Extraneous features can lend a fancier atmosphere, but also tend to foster stressful situations capable of diminishing your enjoyment of the occasion. Use the ideas here and have a happy wedding.<br /><br />Review more about: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2V2ZW50cy12ZW51ZXMud2VlYmx5LmNvbS9pZGVhcy1mb3ItYnJpbmdpbmctZG93bi10aGUtY29zdC1vZi13ZWRkaW5nLWZsb3dlcnMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">wedding flowers maleny</a>.
