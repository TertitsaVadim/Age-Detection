<br />Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing.
<br /><br />Albert Einstein: 
<br />Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.
<br /><br />Helen Keller: 
<br />Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
<br /><br />Mark Twain: 
<br />To arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man's character one must judge it by the standards of his time, not ours.
<br /><br />Ralph Waldo Emerson: 
<br />Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams.
<br /><br />Ralph Waldo Emerson: 
<br />It is the duty of men to judge men only by their actions. Our faculties furnish us with no means of arriving at the motive, the character, the secret self. We call the tree good from its fruits, and the man, from his works.

<br />&quot;If Allah loves someone He calls (angel) Jibreel and says: I
<br />love so-and-so, so you love him. Jibreel loves him, and calls
<br />the other angels in Heaven to love that person. They love him,
<br />then his love will be made upon earth, and he becomes loved. 
<br /><br />&quot;And if Allah hates someone He calls Jibreel and says: I hate
<br />so-and-so and you hate him. Jibreel hates him and calls the
<br />angels in Heaven and says: Allah hates so-and-so, so you all
<br />hate him. They all hate him, and his hatred is made upon earth
<br />and he becomes hated.&quot; - Muslim
<br /><br />[Lessons from this hadith] People do things for the sake of
<br />seeking out love from other humans. All the love you need is
<br />found in obeying Allah. Do actions sincerely to win Allah's
<br />love, and love will be yours!

<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Arthur Ashe, the legendary Wimbledon player was dying of AIDS which he
<br />&gt; got due to infected blood he received during a heart surgery in 1983.
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; From world over, he received letters from his fans, one of which
<br />&gt; conveyed: 'Why does GOD have to select you for such a bad disease'?
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; To this Arthur Ashe replied:
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; ' The world over -- 50 million children start playing tennis, 5 million
<br />&gt; learn to play tennis, 50 reach Wimbledon, 4 to semi final, 2 to the
<br />&gt; finals, when I was holding a cup I never asked GOD 'Why me?'.
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; And today in pain I should not be asking GOD 'Why me?''
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Trials keep you Strong,
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Sorrow keeps you Human,
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Failure keeps you humble and Success keeps you glowing, but only Faith
<br />&gt; Keeps you going...

Rasulullah ( s.a) asked Jibrael (a.s) WHAT IS IT.........................................???
<br />&gt; Jibraeel (a.s) answer to Rasulullah ( s.a) WHEN ONE OF YOUR UMMATII RECITES 
<br />&gt; DUROOD OR SALAM FOR YOU, Blessing Allah (swt) showers upon him bcomes impossible for me to count!!!!!!
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; THE TEARS OF RASULULLAH (S.A)...Suddenly, there was a person said salaam. &quot;May I come in?&quot; he asked. But Fatimah did not allow him enter the room. &quot;I'm sorry, my father is ill,&quot; said Fatimah turned her body back and closed the door. She went back to her father who had opened his eyes and asked Fatimah, &quot;Who was he, my daughter?&quot; &quot;I don't know, my father. It was the first time for me to see him,&quot; Fatimah said gently. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Then, Rasulullah ( s.a) looked at his daughter with trembled look, as if he wanted to reminisce about every part of her daughter's face. &quot;Know one thing! He is who erases the temporary pleasure; he is who separates the companionship in the world. He is the death angel,&quot; said Rasulullah(s.a) Fatimah bore the bomb of her cry. The death angel came toward him, 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; But Rasulullah (s.a) asked why Jibril did not come along with him. Then, Jibril was called. Jibril was ready in the sky to welcome the soul of Habibullah and the leader of the earth. &quot;O Jibril, explain me about my rights in front of ALLAH?&quot; Rasulullah (s.a) asked with a weakest voice.&quot;The doors of sky has opened, the angels are waiting for your soul.&quot; &quot;All jannats open widely waiting for you,&quot; Jibril said. But, in fact, those all did not make Rasulullah ( s.a) relieve, his eyes were still full of worry.&quot;You are not happy to hear this news?&quot; asked Jibril. &quot;Tell me about the 
<br />&gt; destiny of my people in future?&quot; 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; &quot;Don't worry, O Rasul ALLAH ( s.a).. I heard ALLAH told me: 'I make jannat haram for every one, except the people of Muhammad (s.a) are inside it,&quot; Jibril said. It became closer and closer, the time for Malaekat Izrail to do his work. Slowly, Rasulullah's ( s.a) soul was pulled. It was seemed that the body of Rasulullah (s.a) was full of sweat; the nerves of his neck became tight. &quot;Jibril, how pain this sakaratul maut is!&quot;
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Rasulullah (s.a) uttered a groan slowly. Fatimah closed her eyes, Ali (r.a) sat beside her bow deeply and Jibril turned his face back. &quot;Am I repugnant to you that you turn your face back o Jibril?&quot; Rasulullah (s.a) asked to the Deliverer of Wahyu. &quot;Who is the one who could see the Habibullah in his sakaratul maut,&quot; Jibril said. 
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Not for a while, Rasulullah (s.a ) uttered a groan because of unbearable pain. &quot;O ALLAH, how 
<br />&gt; greatest is this sakaratul maut. Give me all these pains, don't to my people.&quot; The body of Rasulullah (s.a ) became cold, his feet and chest didnot move anymore.
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; His lips vibrated as if he wanted to say something, Ali took his ear close to Rasulullah (s.a) . &quot;Uushiikum bis salati, wa maa malakat aimanuku - take care the salaat and take care the weak people among you.&quot; Outside the room, there were cries shouted each other, sahabah held each other. Fatimah closed her face with her hands and, again, Ali (r.a) took his ear Close to Rasulullah's ( s.a) mouth which became bluish. &quot;Ummatii, ummatii, ummatii?&quot; - &quot;My people, my people, my people.&quot; And the life of the noble man ended.
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Could We Love Each Other Like Him?
<br />&gt; Allahumma salli ' ala Muhammad wa baarik wa salim 'alaihi. How deep is 
<br />&gt; Rasulullah's (s.a) love to us.
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Note:
<br />&gt; Send this to all your Muslim friends so that the awareness to love ALLAH and His Rasul (s.a) appears as ALLAH and His Rasul ( s.a) love us - because - truly - the other loves, except it is only fana thing. Ameen..
<br />&gt; 
<br />&gt; Don't worry if people hate you because there are many others who love and care you in the earth. But be worry if ALLAH hates you because there isno other who loves an cares you in akhirat

<br /><br />Generally speaking a normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 and 450,000 per mm3. These limits, however, are determined by the 2.5th lower and upper percentile, and a deviation does not necessarily imply any form of disease. The number of platelets in a blood sample also decreases rather quickly with time and a low platelet count may be caused by a delay between sampling and analysis.
<br /><br /><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong>
<br />Often, low platelet levels do not lead to clinical problems; rather, they are picked up on a routine full blood count (or CBC, complete blood count ). Occasionally, there may be bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms, nosebleeds and/or bleeding gums.
<br /><br />It is vital that a full medical history is elicited, to ensure the low platelet count is not due to a secondary process. It is also important to ensure that the other blood cell types red blood cells, and white blood cells, are not also suppressed.
<br /><br /><strong>Diagnosis</strong>
<br />Laboratory tests might include: full blood count, liver enzymes, renal function, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral blood smear.
<br /><br />If the cause for the low platelet count remains unclear, bone marrow biopsy is often undertaken, to differentiate whether the low platelet count is due to decreased production or peripheral destruction.
<br /><br /><strong>Causes</strong>
<br />Decreased platelet counts can be due to a number of disease processes:
<br /><br /><strong>Decreased production</strong>
<br /><br />vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency 
<br />leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome 
<br />Decreased production of thrombopoietin by the liver in liver failure. 
<br />Sepsis, systemic viral or bacterial infection 
<br />Dengue fever can cause thrombocytopenia by direct infection of bone marrow megakaryocytes as well as immunological shortened platelet survival 
<br />Hereditary syndromes 
<br />Congenital Amegakaryocytic Thrombocytopenia (CAMT) 
<br />Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome 
<br />Fanconi anemia 
<br />Bernard-Soulier syndrome, associated with large platelets 
<br />May-Hegglin anomaly, the combination of thrombocytopenia, pale-blue leuckocyte inclusions, and giant platelets 
<br />Grey platelet syndrome 
<br />Alport syndrome 
<br /><br /><strong>Increased destruction</strong>
<br /><br />idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) 
<br />thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
<br />hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) 
<br />disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
<br />paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) 
<br />antiphospholipid syndrome 
<br />systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
<br />post transfusion purpura 
<br />neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAITP) 
<br />Splenic sequestration of platelets due to hypersplenism 
<br />Dengue fever has been shown to cause shortened platelet survival and immunological platelet destruction 
<br />HIV <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0268960X01901882"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0268960X01901882</a> 
<br /><br /><strong>Medication-induced</strong>
<br />The most comprehensive list of thrombocytopenia-inducing medications is maintained by Dr. James George at Ohio State University at this website, though last updated in 2004. A small subset of drug-induced thrombocytopenia culprits:
<br /><br /><strong>Drug name </strong>
<br />Heparin 
<br />Valproic acid 
<br />Quinidine 
<br />Abciximab 
<br />Sulfonamide antibiotics 
<br />Interferons 
<br />Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine 
<br />Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors 
<br />Clopidogrel 
<br />Vancomycin [1][2] 
<br />Linezolid 
<br />Famotidine 
<br /><br />Direct myelosuppression 
<br />Valproic acid 
<br />Methotrexate 
<br />Carboplatin 
<br />Interferon 
<br />Other chemotherapy drugs 
<br />Immunological platelet destruction 
<br />Drug binds Fab portion of an antibody. The classic example of this mechanism is the quinidine group of drugs. The Fc portion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process. 
<br />Drug binds to Fc, and drug-antibody complex binds and activates platelets. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the classic example of this phenomenon. In HIT, the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet. Since Fc portion of the antibody is bound to the platelets, they are not available to the Fc receptors of the reticulo-endothelial cells, so therefore this system cannot destroy platelets as usual. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT. 
<br />Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT or white clot syndrome): this is a rare but serious condition that may occur in a hospitalized population. The most common clinical setting for HIT is in postoperative coronary artery bypass graft recipients, who may receive large quantities of heparin during surgery. HIT typically occurs about a week after exposure to heparin. The heparin-PF4 antibody complex will activate the platelets, and this can often lead to thrombosis. The term HITT, where the last T stands for thrombosis, denotes the concept that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia often is associated with thrombosis
<br /><br /><strong>Treatment</strong>
<br />Treatment is guided by etiology and disease severity. The main concept in treating thrombocytopenia is to eliminate the underlying problem, whether that means discontinuing suspected drugs that cause thrombocytopenia, or treating underlying sepsis. Diagnosis and treatment of serious thrombocytopenia is usually directed by a hematologist.
<br /><br />Specific treatment plans often depend on the underlying etiology of the thrombocytopenia.
<br /><br /><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</strong>
<br />Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a medical emergency, since the hemolytic anemia and platelet activation can lead to renal failure and changes in the level of consciousness. Treatment of TTP was revolutionized in the 1980s with the application of plasmapheresis. According to the Furlan-Tsai hypothesis [3] [4] , this treatment theoretically works by removing antibodies directed against the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease, ADAMTS-13. The plasmapheresis procedure also adds active ADAMTS-13 protease proteins to the patient, restoring a more physiological state of von Willebrand factor multimers. Patients with persistent antibodies against ADAMTS-13 do not always manifest TTP, and these antibodies alone are not sufficient to explain the how plasmapheresis treats TTP.
<br /><br /><strong>ITP</strong>
<br />In many cases, ITP is self-limited, and does not require treatment. Platelet counts less than ten thousand per mm3 usually require treatment(less than fifty thousand requires treatment, less than ten thousand is a potentially dangerous situation) and patients with significant bleeding and thrombocytopenia due to ITP are also usually treated. The threshold for treating ITP has decreased since the 1990s, and hematologists recognize that patients rarely bleed with platelet counts greater than ten thousand, though there are documented exceptions to this observation. Treatments for ITP include:
<br /><br />Prednisone and other corticosteroids 
<br />Intravenous gamma globulin 
<br />Splenectomy 
<br />Danazol 
<br />Rituximab 
<br />Thrombopoetin analogues have been tested extensively for the treatment of ITP. These agents had previously shown promise but had been found to stimulate antibodies against endogenous thrombopoeitin or lead to thrombosis.
<br /><br />A medication known as AMG 531 was found to be safe and effective for the treatment of ITP in refractory patients. [5] AMG 531 is a peptide that bears no sequence homology with endogenous human thrombopoeitin, so it is not as likely to lead to neutralizing antibodies as previous peptide thrombopoeitin analogues. [6]
<br /><br /><strong>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT)</strong>
<br />Discontinuation of heparin is critical in a case of HITT. Beyond that, however, care must be taken to avoid a thrombosis, and patients started directly on warfarin after a diagnosis of HITT are at excess risk of venous limb gangrene. For this reason, patients are usually treated with a type of blood thinner called a direct thrombin inhibitor such as the FDA-approved lepirudin or argatroban. Other blood thinners sometimes used in this setting that are not FDA-approved for treatment of HITT include bivalirudin and fondaparinux. Platelet transfusions are not a routine component of the treatment of HITT, since thrombosis, not bleeding, is the usual associated problem in this illness.
<br /><br /><strong>Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT)</strong>
<br />Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is a rare inherited disorder. The primary manifestations are thrombocytopenia and megakaryocytopenia, or low numbers of platelets and megakaryocytes. There is an absence of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow with no associated physical abnormalities.[7] The cause for this disorder appears to be a mutation in the gene for the TPO receptor, c-mpl, despite high levels of serum TPO.[8][9] In addition, there may be abnormalities with the central nervous system including the cerebrum and cerebellum which could cause symptoms.[8] The primary treatment for CAMT is bone marrow transplantation.
<br /><br />Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant is the only thing that ultimately cures this genetic disease. Frequent platelet transfusions are required to keep the patient from bleeding to death until transplant is done, although this is not always the case.
<br /><br />One of the few non Medical Research related sources on the web with some information on CAMT is;
<br /><br /><strong>CAMT Specific Infant Bone Marrow Transplant Journal </strong>
<br />There appears to be no generic resource for CAMT patients on the web, and this is potentially due to the rariety of the disease.

<br /><br />God took the strenght of a mountain,
<br />The Majesty of a tree,
<br />The warmth of a summer sun,
<br />The calm of a quiet sea,
<br />The generous soul of nature,
<br />The comforting arm of night,
<br />The wisdom of the ages,
<br />The power of the eagle`s flight,
<br />The joy of a morning in spring,
<br />The faith of a mustard seed,
<br />The patience of eternity,
<br />The depth of a family need,
<br />Then God combined these qualities,
<br />when there was nothing more to add,
<br />He Knew His masterpiece was complete,
<br />and so he called it......DAD. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Scientists in the US have identified brain cells linked to FEAR...
<br />paving the way for a more effective treatment of post-traumatic stress
<br />and other anxiety disorder..
<br />It has been found that people with anxiety disorders exhibit an 
<br />EXTINCTION DEFICIT or a failure to FORGET. However, until recently,
<br />the mechanism of extinction have remained unkown.
<br />Professor Denis Par at New Jersey`s Centre for molecular and 
<br />behavioural Neurosciences Of Rutgers University Look into Amygdala
<br />(apart of brain which involves in the extinction, elimination of fear
<br />or hapiness. Amygdala has involved in the expression of innate fear 
<br />responses, such as the fear of snakes, dark, and such sounds. etc.)
<br />Researches has shown that in any given year about 40 million adults
<br />(18 years or older) will suffer from some form of anxiety disorder,
<br />including debiliating conditions such phobias, panic disroders,
<br />and post-traumatic stress dsorders (PTSD)

<br /><br />Some Cancer Patients may find that putting their emotions down in 
<br />writing helps improve their pain and general well-being, a study
<br />suggests.
<br />Such writing, part of a concept called NARRATIVE medicine, has been
<br />seen as a way to aid communication between seriously ill patients and
<br />their doctors. But the act of writing , itself, may also help patients
<br />needs, according to the study team, led by Dr. M. Soledad Cepeda of
<br />Tufts-New England Medical Centre in Boston.
<br />To look at the question, the team randomly assigned 234 cancer 
<br />patients to one of three groups:
<br /><br />1. group one that was asked to perform narrative writing
<br />2. group two that was asked to filled out a standard questionnare 
<br />about pain sympotms.
<br />3. group three that was to stayed with standard care only.
<br /><br />All of the study patients were suffering from atleast moderate levels
<br />of pain from their disease.
<br />The team found that patients in the 1st group were open about their 
<br />emotions showed less pain and greater well-being over time than the 
<br />rest of the study subjects.
<br />The findings sugessts that the emotional release of writing, 
<br />specifically, is what helps patients deal with their cancer pain,
<br />according to the team. However, they add, it is also possible that
<br />the most seriously ill patients find it more difficult to write about
<br />their feelings.
<br />More studies are needed, the researchers conclude to see wheather
<br />encouraging seriously ill patients to reveal their in writing benefits
<br />their well-being. In addtion, they say studies should look wheather
<br />verbally telling one`s story has positive effect.
