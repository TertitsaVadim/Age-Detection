This is easy if you love designer &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci on sale&quot; title=&quot;gucci on sale&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guccisfactory-outlets.com%2Fgucci-accessories-c-62.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guccisfactory-outlets.com/gucci-accessories-c-62.html</a>]gucci on sale[/url] fashion.&amp;nbsp; Fashion is a huge industry.&amp;nbsp; Wholesale designer handbags and fashion is also quickly becoming a very large and profitable industry.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;But as good as it sounds, there are many things to know before you jump in and become a &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci outlet&quot; title=&quot;gucci outlet&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guccisfactory-outlets.com%2Fgucci-boots-c-5.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guccisfactory-outlets.com/gucci-boots-c-5.html</a>]gucci outlet[/url]r.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The most important issue you must understand is the manufacturing and distribution channels of the top designers.&amp;nbsp; The production of designer handbags is almost a top-secret event.&amp;nbsp; With the heavy competition between the designers to offer the latest and hottest trends for the up coming season, handbag manufacturers keep quite about their production runs, the quantity they will produce and orders must be placed two or three seasons in advance just to get any product.&amp;nbsp; What does this mean to you, the &lt;a alt=&quot;cheap gucci&quot; title=&quot;cheap gucci&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guccisfactory-outlets.com%2F2011-gucci-outlet-c-66.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guccisfactory-outlets.com/2011-gucci-outlet-c-66.html</a>]cheap gucci[/url]?&amp;nbsp; It means that you cannot call up GUCCI or Hermes and ask for a couple hundred bags and expect to not get laughed at (in Italian of French of course).&amp;nbsp; It also means that the top designer handbag manufacturers only supply their product to large retailers, small boutiques and maybe a website with an exclusive contract.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;So where do all the handbags that you see for sale online come from?&amp;nbsp; Well, that is the key to getting into the wholesale designer handbag business.&amp;nbsp; Most of the bags come from intentional or unintentional overstock by the small to medium size boutiques oversees.&amp;nbsp; They will sell off their surplus of last season's handbags to distributors who will then sell them to &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci handbags&quot; title=&quot;gucci handbags&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guccisfactory-outlets.com%2Fgucci-2011-bags-c-14.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guccisfactory-outlets.com/gucci-2011-bags-c-14.html</a>]gucci handbags[/url].&amp;nbsp; It is your goal to find these distributors.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;To find reputable, honest dealers who distribute authentic merchandise is tricky.&amp;nbsp; There are a couple of things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;**Most dealers that sell designers from Italy, France and England are not found in the US.&amp;nbsp; It only makes sense.&amp;nbsp; They need to have a close relationship with the boutiques, and very rarely the manufacturers themselves, that supply them with their overstock.&amp;nbsp; So become familiar with what country the handbags you want to sell were originally produced.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;**Learn the language.&amp;nbsp; You will need to learn a little Italian or French.&amp;nbsp; Just enough to understand colors, styles and shapes of the handbags when you are given an inventory list.&amp;nbsp; It would also be good to know enough to at least say hello and what your intentions are when initially contacting the dealer.&amp;nbsp; Learning the language is also extremely helpful when conducting searches on the internet.&amp;nbsp; Don't limit your search to pages here in the US, search google and yahoo in Italian and French as well.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;**Contact as many dealers as possible.&amp;nbsp; This will help to validate which ones are honest and have an interest in a business relationship.&amp;nbsp; Once you have received the inventory/price list from several dealers, cross reverence them.&amp;nbsp; Are the prices similar?&amp;nbsp; Are the quantities on hand reasonable?&amp;nbsp; This is important to gage if the dealer is selling authentic merchandise.&amp;nbsp; If he has 600 of a particular bag, chances are they are not real.&amp;nbsp; It is not reasonable, given the means in which he most likely purchases his stock and the production methods of the manufacturing, that he would have so many of one style.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;**Understand all terms of sale prior to placing an order.&amp;nbsp; It is not uncommon that the dealer will want a deposit on your order.&amp;nbsp; You will usually commit 30% up front and pay the remainder when the items have shipped.&amp;nbsp; Many dealers will only accept bank transfers.&amp;nbsp; This is where becoming a designer handbag wholesaler takes a great deal of faith.&amp;nbsp; A bank transfer offers no protection from the dealer taking your money and never shipping product.&amp;nbsp; If he was dishonest and took the funds, but shipped nothing, you could have very little recourse.&amp;nbsp; Unlike a money order or credit card purchase, there is no 3rd party protection.&amp;nbsp; At the least, make sure you have the dealers phone number, complete business address and email address.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Of course, like with all start-up business, there are many, many more things to consider.&amp;nbsp; But to make your search for the right distributor easier, we highly recommend going to ModaImports.com.&amp;nbsp; Unlike the many lists and directories that claim to offer true sources for authentic designer handbags, ModaImports.com has used, or contacted, all of the sources on their Supplier Database.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you have a passion for fashion and are looking to start your own lucrative business, wholesale authentic designer handbags is a great business opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

This includes &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci sneakers&quot; title=&quot;gucci sneakers&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-jewelry-gucci-necklace-c-56_62.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-jewelry-gucci-necklace-c-56_62.html</a>]gucci sneakers[/url] and everything in between. Bags are no exception. There are about hundreds of designs and countless brands to choose from. All these are a result of their unquenchable thirst for the perfect bag.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;And really, nothing is as wonderful as owning lots of authentic designer bags. If you're a man, the thrill is like owning the sports car you've been dreaming of since you were a little boy. Having at least one genuine luxury piece will make anyone feel like they're on top of the world.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;But the ever-present dilemma among the bag-buying population is this-knowing if the piece they just bought is real or really fake. So how exactly do you know if your Gucci, Dior or Tory Burch &lt;a alt=&quot;authentic gucci&quot; title=&quot;authentic gucci&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-bags-c-20.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-bags-c-20.html</a>]authentic gucci[/url] are real or fake?&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;For one, check the details. Genuine &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci boots&quot; title=&quot;gucci boots&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-shoes-c-7.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-shoes-c-7.html</a>]gucci boots[/url] are intricately designed and have well-embossed logos. The materials used are also durable, and are not just any ordinary kind of leather or fabric. Another thing to evaluate is the craftsmanship and the manner of which each piece has been made.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It also pays to check out the official website of these authentic pieces. If you are keenly interested in owning a certain style or design, check out its details on their website and really pay attention to the intricacies. For one thing, designer handbags do not have crooked stitching. This will greatly help you in spotting a genuine one from a fake piece when you see it on display in your favorite outlet.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Another way to find out if the bag is real is by the price. Depending on a brand's popularity, a piece could go to as high as a few thousand dollars! Any regular working woman and teenager will need to work round the clock to buy at least one piece, unless she is an heiress or a celebrity. If someone is selling the handbag to you from the back of a trunk for fifty bucks or less, then you should know that you are getting what you are paying for.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Of course, all is not lost. You can still own selected genuine handbags when stores go on clearance sales. Discount and inventory sales happen only once in a blue moon and when it does, ladies celebrate to the hilt. Just make sure that you're not buying a replica or an imitation--unless you know that's exactly what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to shopping, bargain hunting for your next gucci mens is the name of the game. We all love to own purses. Our closets are full of all sorts of Designer Names like &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci sale&quot; title=&quot;gucci sale&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2F2011-gucci-shawls-c-99.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/2011-gucci-shawls-c-99.html</a>]gucci sale[/url], Gucci, gucci bag, Marc Jacobs, Christian Dior, Prada and Chanel. We even have some older Coach, Cole Haan and Dooney &amp;amp;amp; Bourke lurking in our collection. Nonetheless, when it comes to making the final decision, we base the purchase on realistic factors, not whether or not we can refinance our home to own a new designer purse.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Here's what the average shopper looks for when making a designer &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci mens&quot; title=&quot;gucci mens&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-shoes-gucci-men-sneakers-c-7_66.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-shoes-gucci-men-sneakers-c-7_66.html</a>]gucci mens[/url] purse purchase: price, authenticity, style, color, design, functionality, craftmanship, versatility, availability, mood, impulse and status. The topics listed below are not arranged in order of importance or priority. They are just factors which come into play when a person gets ready to purchase a new designer purse.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;PRICE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the average price tag of a high-end designer bag sitting on the shelves at Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue was around $2000. Today, according to a Designer &lt;a alt=&quot;discount gucci&quot; title=&quot;discount gucci&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-scarves-c-94.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-scarves-c-94.html</a>]discount gucci[/url] Sales Person at Neimans in Beverly Hills, the average ticket price has risen. As a matter of fact, there's nothing on the shelves today with a price tag less than about $1800. That will make the average cost hit around $2500 - $3000 each or more! Wow! We need resources for discount authentic designer handbags.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Online shopping seems to be the best way to find what you want fast with ease and convenience. There are search engines like Google.com where a shopper can enter the search terms &amp;quot;designer handbags&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;designer purses&amp;quot; and receive a list of potential ecommerce sites for making an educated, cost-effective purchase.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;An unlimited list of websites selling discounted brands have surfaced over the past several years like Overstock, eFashionHouse.com, Smart Bargains, and others. Sticking to sites like these with longevity is probably a bargain hunters best bet. These sites have been online for over ten years and are considered Internet Pioneers.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If price doesn't matter, eLuxury sells many of the name brands at full retail prices. As does Neimans and Saks. And, there are &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci bag&quot; title=&quot;gucci bag&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-bags-c-20.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-bags-c-20.html</a>]gucci bag[/url] sales to hit frequently throughout the year, but most of the time the full-retail sites' prices are still out of reach for the average shopper.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;We contacted some of the discount websites about price points. EFashionHouse.com's average sale is about $200-$300, and the majority of discount shoppers spend around $200 - $500 for their everyday handbag.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Price points rise to the occasion, and when it comes to special events or certain brands even bargain hunters will pay a little more for brands like Chanel or Hermes. This includes some of the high-end Chloe or Chanel bags that range in an off retail price of about $900 to $1900 each. Keep in mind, full retail for the same items range from about $2000 to $4000 each. Chanel jewelry items sporting the iconic CC logo are also collector items. The jewelry items become part of the owner's collection and are handed down through the generations just like the famous designer handbags.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AUTHENTICITY.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Some people say the authenticity of a designer item doesn't matter, but it really does matter. I'd bet 99% of the people who own a fake designer purse would say it doesn't matter. In my opinion, 1% are being honest and the other 99% are telling a lie.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It also makes sense to assume in most instances, the person who purchases a fake designer item doesn't know it's fake until well after the purchase is made, if ever. Maybe the shopper does not know where to purchase authentic items at an affordable price. Or, thinks they can't afford to buy a real designer item.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If all you're looking for is something to carry your stuff, then authenticity doesn't matter. If you are a true designer handbag appreciator, then it matters big time.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Anyone who owns a fake bag knows it's a fake. So, what does that say about the person? Are they living a lie? Is their life a fake? Isn't how we show up in life a statement of what we are about? We are what we eat. So, if we carry a fake designer handbag, then we must be a fake.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Counterfeiting is illegal. It defacing the image of the real designer, and most designers spend their entire career building their credibility and image. It's not politically correct to deface the logo of a designer without the designer's permission. Besides, fake designer products are made poorly and won't last past one season's wear.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Authenticity matters to the person who is looking for longevity, durability and integrity. Carrying an authentic bag makes a person feel a sense of esteem especially if the person saved their hard earned cash to buy it. Knowing it's real and it was a small investment adds to the reassurance of value and values.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;STYLE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Just like the assortment of jelly beans at JellyBelly.com are the style of designer handbags. There are shoulder bags, clutch bags, tote bags, wristlets, hobos, satchels, doctor bags, brief case bags, backpacks, everyday bags, dressy bags, sling bags, body bags, man bags, leather bags, monogram bags, studded bags, metallic bags, messenger bag, school bag, book bag, patent bags, evening bags, beaded bags, vegan bags, cloth bags, vinyl bags, etc. The list is endless and dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Style predicts functionality, construction and versatility. The majority of handbag users (there are women who do not carry a purse) own a variety of styles because a different purse is needed for every occasion. The average person's designer purse collection consists of several basic styles like a shoulder bag, clutch bag, tote bag, satchel and dressy evening bag. The majority of people have several of each style. Why? Because they want to!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Shoulder bags are the most popular style of all. The shoulder bag has a strap conveniently long enough to carry over the shoulder with comfort and ease keeping both hands free (i.e., for shopping and clapping when a perfectly priced designer purse is found). Many shoulder straps are adjustable creating a different style for different needs. Usually, an adjustable shoulder strap can be carried on the shoulder, made longer to carry across the body as a messenger bag or made short enough to carry snugly under the arm.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Many styles are named due to familiarity like the satchel styled doctor bag or the baguette named after a loaf of baguette Italian or French bread. In Europe, a fresh loaf of Italian or French bread is carried home from the bakery snuggly under the arm and close to the body. Hence, the famous baguette style handbag was born. Some say the baguette is a style of the past, yet it's a style that will live on for handbags like Elvis lives on for rock and roll.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;COLOR.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Need we discuss the purpose of color? The seasons predict the handbag colors as do the designers. The design houses meet regularly to set trends and share color pallets. That's why we see the new black each season.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows anything about fashion understands the importance of and owns a little black dress. The same holds true for a designer handbag. Black is the staple color and everything else is for enhancement, mood and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;In 2007, we can carry any color any time of the year to any type of event we desire. The rules have changed. We think and do what we want. Some follow no rules at all. The more conservatives stick to the basics, and the edgy fashion freaks pull off a lime green pebble grain Hermes bag with comfort and ease.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Matching shoes and bags is a thing of the past, too. The true fashionista doesn't match because it's boring. The striking eye catching habit of a fashion guru is sporting one glorious high end designer accessory to pull the entire outfit together.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;We spend under a hundred bucks for our jeans keeping the color neutral making the background work nicely with an outrageously funky colored or multi colored designer purse.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, color plays a roll regardless of one's conservability level. Even the more conservative dresser will pull it all together with a staple like a black or brown Prada bag.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;DESIGN.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Design and style are somewhat synonymous. However, design falls more closely within the areas of size and functionality creating a unique designer look with versatility and appeal.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;All the talk about size doesn't matter is not true when it comes to a new purse. Size does matter. The bigger the better for some, and small, petite for others. The design of a large bag will affect the price tag when it's a high end designer purse. So, if you are making your first designer handbag purchase and want to start out slowly, buy a smaller bag.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Most of the designers use functionality as criteria when designing a bag. Pockets are inside and outside the bag. Today, cell phone and iPod pockets are an added attraction. External zip pockets change the design, look and feel of a bag as do studs which create a unique design.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;A variety of factors go into the design of a purse especially its fabrication. You will be pleased with a hand crafted bag. That's why we encourage shoppers to buy authentic items and stay away from the Made in China labels. The differences are obvious when inspecting the stitching, leather quality, hardware and linings. Even top designer Stella McCartney who never uses any animal products in her handbags uses top quality fabrics and expert craftsmanship. The non leather, pricey, vinyl, McCartney totes cost thousands of dollars!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;FUNCTIONALITY.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Without sounding redundant, a touch on function is important when making a handbag purchase. School bags serve a specific purpose as do evening bags. So, it's wise to select your designer handbag based on how you plan to use it.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Call me silly, but I wear a Gucci belt bag when I walk. Sorry, I admit I'm a brand horror. Functionality plays an important role for a purse. When shopping, it's smart to carry a bag to keep your hands free. For evening or dress up, carry a small clutch bag because all you'll need is keys, a credit card and a condom!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;CRAFTMANSHIP.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Whenever you get a chance, pick up a Hermes bag and inspect it carefully. Hermes equates craftsmanship and are the leaders of pack. They are tradition and quality. Once you've had Hermes it's hard to go back. If you don't understand that statement, then you haven't owned a Hermes.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Yet, we can't all afford to carry a Hermes or save our money to buy one because most of the Hermes purses cost more than the blue book value of the cars we drive. The Hermes leather bags range in price from $5000 to $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;However, we can save our money for other well crafted designer merchandise by famous people like Miuccia Prada, Maria Silvia Venturini Fendi, Louis Vuitton, CoCo Chanel, Bottega Veneta and Marc Jacobs. Of news lately is the announcement made by Chanel Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld who has signed a deal with Accessory Network Group to produce his own line of leather handbags. They are scheduled to hit the shelves in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;VERSATILITY.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Although versatility is a factor in making a designer purse purchase, the role it plays is probably not as important as you may think. Probably the most versatile factoring thought crossing our mind at the time of purchase is this, &amp;quot;Can I carry this bag when wearing blue jeans, a T-shirt and flip flops?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;All kidding aside, when we think of versatility we apply the 80/20 rule. Eighty percent of the time we'll be using this bag everyday for work, school or play. Whereas, twenty percent of the time, we will not!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Versatility of a new purse applies to our everyday lifestyle. We can relate to the object as &amp;quot;my bag, my look, it's me.&amp;quot; And, if putting out a hefty dollar amount, you'll want to make certain it's something you'll want to keep around for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;AVAILABILITY.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;I hear women talk about spending the day shopping and not finding anything. That doesn't happen to me. I may spend time surfing the net looking for bargains and not buying a lot of stuff, but spending the day at the mall and coming home empty handed doesn't happen to me.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It's true, supply and demand play an important role in availability of a new designer purse. But more importantly is the money you have available to spend for it, who you are and who you know. A good example is the Hermes Birkin and Kelly Bags. They are rare finds. Yet, every celebrity owns them. And, most people who shop Hermes regularly can get most anything they want.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Currently, Bottega Veneta woven leathers are difficult to source at discount prices. They rarely go on sale, and the supply is not as available as it was in the past. Maybe the value of the Euro has caused this phenomenon to occur. Almost all of the high end designer handbags made in Europe have steadily increased in priced and decreased in availability since the Euro hit the market.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;MOOD.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Don't laugh. I'm in my late 50's and just recently purchased my first Louis Vuitton bag. I finally found a couple of styles I like, so I made the leap. I own Hermes Birkin and Kelly bags, and because I'm a minimalist, my favorites are simple totes by Goyard or Chloe. But the mood hit me one day and during my evening ritual shopping online I picked up two Louis Vuittons on eLuxury, and love them both.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Does mood affect your purchase? Oh, yes absolutely. Some even equate shopping for a new purse therapeutic and much more worthy of one's hard earned dollars than paying a therapist's hourly rate.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;IMPULSE.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Whether impulse is a true factor in making a designer handbag purchase is unknown, but most of us have experienced an impulse buy. There's really not much good when a purchase is made from impulse. It's mentioned only because some of us make impulse purchases and regret it later. An impulse purchase is probably done for all the wrong reasons, and sometimes guilt or remorse follow. When that happens you may have a serious shopping problem.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If shopping is causing a problem in your life, visit ShopaholicsAnonymous.org.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;STATUS.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The role of status and designer handbags is more important to some than to others. Just like driving a Mercedes vs. a Volkswagen is important when it comes to cars, carrying a Hermes vs. a Kenneth Cole leather handbag can be important for the person making a purse purchase.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it only goes to reason the higher the price tag the greater status, the bigger the ego the bigger designer name, and rubbing elbows with Bill Gates at a party Saturday night vs. coffee with the church pastor Sunday morning all play a role in factoring in status for your next handbag purchase.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;While trying to keep up with the Jones' is not your style, maybe owning a status symbol as an investment is. Some of the designer handbags purchased years ago sell today for hundreds if not, thousands of dollars more today than their purchase prices.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;So, status may not be your intention, but when digging through Grandma's closet reveals a 1950's Hermes Kelly Bag you'll definitely feel like a million bucks!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

It owes its success, because it has evolved in the fashion trends through out the times and yet kept its iconic and stylish flair. Gucci bags are renowned worldwide and are very sought after.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Back in the days, a messenger bag was far from being considered as a fashion accessory. In the contrary, it was very much just a practical utility bag mainly used by messenger or postal workers -that is where its name comes from-. It slowly got adopted by an urban and sporty population and as cycling to work became such a trend within the city office workers community, this crossover bag finally became a must-have fashion item.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It became a great replacement to a backpack and grew in popularity. &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci necklace&quot; title=&quot;gucci necklace&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-jewelry-gucci-necklace-c-56_62.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-jewelry-gucci-necklace-c-56_62.html</a>]gucci necklace[/url] started to see the opportunity and jump the wagon which accelerated the demand for it even further.

Leather bags are popular for men. It makes them look trendy with class, they look professional, serious and successful. The color needs to remain sober for them, in general brown or black.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Then, women also wanted bigger versatile and practical bags: its Gucci collection for these types of bags has generally a unisex look.

This being a very disappointing and embarrassing experience, I was determined to fix things and make them right again.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Finding a store online that sells the real deal &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci ties&quot; title=&quot;gucci ties&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-accessories-gucci-ties-c-1_86.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-accessories-gucci-ties-c-1_86.html</a>]gucci ties[/url] can be very hazardous because most online stores claim to sell what they really don't have or sometimes they just sell fakes or replica products. I did a thorough check on that one! Most online stores are just there for your money!&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The fake sneakers are very easy to identify on delivery; they are of fake leathers, they have no manufacture number (reference number) and a lot more. If you're looking for the real deal sneakers, please visit the source below.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

These boots were originally worn by shepherds from Australia who wore them to keep their feet warm. The genuine boots in this style are made from sheepskin of very good quality. They are wonderful at keeping the feet very warm and cozy even when the temperature is very low. Apart from that, these boots are very trendy and wonderfully combine fashion and functionality. It is not difficult to find these boots. They are available everywhere. You can buy them in the stores or you can even buy them online. But as is the case with anything that becomes very popular, there are a lot of fakes of UGG boots in the market. The reason for that is, these &lt;a alt=&quot;ugg outlet boots&quot; title=&quot;ugg outlet boots&quot; href=&quot;]ugg outlet boots[/url] are extremely popular across the world and there is immense brand recall. That's why it makes complete business sense to sell the fakes of these boots. Whereas the &lt;a alt=&quot;ugg sales australia&quot; title=&quot;ugg sales australia&quot; href=&quot;]ugg sales australia[/url] boots are made of sheepskin, these fake boots can be made by any material. It all depends on the ingenuity of the seller.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;With the advent of internet, online shopping has become very popular with everyone. There is an entire world available to you at just the click of a mouse. You can choose your favorite pair of boots from UGG and they will be delivered to you at your doorstep. But online shopping is also fraught with dangers. Unlike in stores where you can inspect the shoes and boots personally, there's no way to know if the stuff you are buying is genuine. The number of shops which deliver fake UGG boots to their customers is ever increasing. These unscrupulous sellers make these boots with the skin of a pig or cowhide.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, these are not as effective and warm as the original ones which are made with sheepskin. The &lt;a alt=&quot;ugg boots classic short&quot; title=&quot;ugg boots classic short&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheapuggbootmall.com%2Fugg-bailey-button-5803-c-1.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapuggbootmall.com/ugg-bailey-button-5803-c-1.html</a>]ugg boots classic short[/url] are made of merino sheepskin. This is the best quality of sheepskin and gives incredible warmth to the feet. The amazing quality about this skin is that it will keep the feet warm during winters and cool in summertime. When you are wearing genuine boots, your feet will never become moist as the superior ventilation of these boots ensures that the feet remain dry all the time.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;So, it is very essential to remain wary of the shops that sell fake UGG boots. When you are planning to buy these boots, you should trust no one but the authorized dealers of these boots. You pay a handsome price for these amazing boots and you deserve nothing less than an original pair.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The Ugg Australia cardy boots is one of the most sought after boots this year and extremely hard to find; the classic cardy boots are all sold out at the Ugg Australia website but but can be found online at a reasonable price. Featured as one of Oprah's favourite things for Christmas 2007 was the classic tall crochet, which is very similar to the cardy boots but with the signature ugg wooden buttons on the side.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Available with colorful crochet knit uppers (composed of a wool blend) and a sheepskin sock liner for extra comfort. A light and flexible outsole along with a suede heel guard provides durable wear all season long. The Classic Cardy is detailed with three over sized wood buttons, allowing it to be styled buttoned up, slouched down, slightly unbuttoned, or completely cuffed down.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on purchasing these &lt;a alt=&quot;kids ugg boots sale&quot; title=&quot;kids ugg boots sale&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheapuggbootmall.com%2Fugg-nightfall-5359-c-11.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapuggbootmall.com/ugg-nightfall-5359-c-11.html</a>]kids ugg boots sale[/url], email the merchant and ask for a discount coupon. In many cases, online stores have a coupons page but they rarely advertise it. Personally, I like shopping at stores that offer free shipping. In many cases, free shipping usually apply to customers in the United States, but if you happen to reside outside of the United States, don't be shy to ask for your purchase to be shipped for free. With so much competition online, some online Merchants will ship to your country for free in order to retain you as a customer.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;The Ugg Australia cardy boots, &lt;a alt=&quot;cheap ugg boots uk&quot; title=&quot;cheap ugg boots uk&quot; href=&quot;]cheap ugg boots uk[/url] short boots and Ugg classic &lt;a alt=&quot;cheap discount ugg boots&quot; title=&quot;cheap discount ugg boots&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheapuggbootmall.com%2Fugg-accessories-ugg-gloves-c-20_22.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapuggbootmall.com/ugg-accessories-ugg-gloves-c-20_22.html</a>]cheap discount ugg boots[/url] are selling fast this summer.

Whatever the reason, if the line you want isn't on sale, just be patient.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Another great option is search the smaller online shoe stores that specialize in Uggs.

They may make it once a year or more frequent. When you are in store, ask a manager when they are planning to hold the next sale. It might be a good idea to wait for it instead of buying now.

All it takes is a quick visit to &amp;quot;the world's largest online marketplace&amp;quot; to see that designer handbags are a hot item. Notice how many bids designer bags with names like gucci men shoes and Gucci get. Ever wonder where they get cheap gucci is and handbags to sell?&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, eBay sellers aren't about to reveal their sources to you and who can blame them? You can bet they didn't find cheap authentic purses by doing a Google search. Most true wholesalers of authentic purses don't make themselves so easy to find. The &amp;quot;wholesalers&amp;quot; you find online are more likely to sell cheap knock off designer purses and &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci men shoes&quot; title=&quot;gucci men shoes&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com</a>]gucci men shoes[/url] - not the real thing. If they do offer authentic designer goods, the prices are usually too high to make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;So where do the sellers get them? Some people selling designer &lt;a alt=&quot;cheap gucci&quot; title=&quot;cheap gucci&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com%2Fgucci-bags-gucci-handbags-c-20_36.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com/gucci-bags-gucci-handbags-c-20_36.html</a>]cheap gucci[/url] bags on eBay buy them secondhand at garage sales and consignment stores. This may work, but finding enough of them is a real challenge. To make it worthwhile, you'll probably need to sell other designer clothing items too or you won't have enough merchandise. Offering clothing is more time consuming than selling designer purses since you have to take measurements and write out longer descriptions. If you get the measurements wrong, you'll end up getting returns - or bad feedback.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Selling designer bags is far simpler than selling clothing and people are more likely to buy a purse online than a pair of  &lt;a alt=&quot;gucci boots&quot; title=&quot;gucci boots&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gucci-handbagsoutlets.com</a>]gucci boots[/url],pants or a skirt they can't try on. Once you're established selling designer purses, you can add purse accessories such as billfolds to your auctions to get add-on sales.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;There's another fringe benefit to selling designer bags. You'll have the privilege of carrying cheap designer purses and handbags. When people ask where you got your purse, give them a business card. Chances are you'll be hearing from them soon.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It's not difficult to expand your market beyond eBay auctions once you get started. You can set up a permanent eBay store or your own website. Some people host designer purse parties out of their home which can be quite lucrative and fun at the same time. There are so many opportunities for making money once you find a source for cheap designer purses and handbags.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you love fashion and are looking for an exciting business to start, try selling designer bags on eBay. It's fun - and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Only 2 games have transpired so far, and already Los Angeles is making a state&lt;a alt=&quot;mlb jerseys&quot; title=&quot;mlb jerseys&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheap-jerseysshop.com%2Fmlb-jersey-c-1.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-jerseysshop.com/mlb-jersey-c-1.html</a>]mlb jerseys[/url]t by winning by almost 30 points per game. Both teams that they have played against so far (Blazers and Clippers) are in their own respective rebuilding modes, but both have taken significant strides in the offseason and neither expected to be blown out like like a division 1-AA school taking on North Carolina. So is this a preview of more to come or simply a burst of pent up aggression from losing in embarrassing fashion the the Celtics in last year's finals?&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;It's hard to find any flaws in LA's game that would point to this being a high point in their season. All their starters are healthy, and that's leading me to believe that they have nowhere to go but up as they begin to gel as teammates. The chemistry between Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol was apparent last season, but the addition of a healthy Andrew Bynum might have been occcasion for a lapse in play as the three start to learn their respective roles together. Quite the contrary, as all have played well immediately - much the same as Boston did last year after aquiring Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. Lamar Odom has been pushed to the bench, where his versatility and aggresive style of play make him the immediate frontrunner for 6th man of the year. In the Clippers game, the Lakers had seven players with 10 or more points, showing that they clearly have the depth and rotation that is required of NBA playoff teams.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;While the Lakers have still have a few area of their game that they need to work on, the benefits of their new look are already apparent. Pau Gasol is a seven footer, yes - but he does significantly better when he's in a power forward position as opposed to banging under the boards with the center. That's where Bynum comes in - at 7'0'' and 275 pounds, Bynum can man up against the opponent's biggest man without really being expected to contribute heavily on offense. That leaves Gasol free to do what he does best, which is to say complimenting the MVP play of Kobe Bryant with stellar low-post offense. Last year in the playoffs, Gasol's offensive production slipped on occasion when he had a tough defensive matchup, which left Kobe to pick up all the offensive slack (which even a stud like Kobe can't always do). Now that shouldn't be a concern, as Bynum's presence shifts the focus away from Gasol on defense. Should the Lakers ever find themse&lt;a alt=&quot;cheap nhl jerseys&quot; title=&quot;cheap nhl jerseys&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheap-jerseysshop.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-jerseysshop.com</a>]cheap nhl jerseys[/url]es at a point where their offense isn't getting it done, they have a lot of guys that can rotate in at multiple positions, leaving the legendary Phil Jackson plenty of options to tailor his lineup to the Lakers' most pressing current need.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Baring an injury to Gasol, Bynum, or Kobe, it's tough to see the Lakers finishing anywhere other than 1st in the western conference on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1qZXJzZXlzc2hvcC5jb20vbmZsLWplcnNleS1jLTMxLmh0bWwmcXVvdDsgdGl0bGU9JnF1b3Q7d2hvbGVzYWxlIG5mbCBqZXJzZXlz" target="_blank">wholesale nfl jerseys</a>, even with so many quality teams fighting for dominance. Kobe has shown that while he can't get it done himself, if Phil Jackson lines the right people up next to him, he wins rings. And it looks like he's finally found the right people to replace the magic that Shaq took from LA when he left.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Many of my friends did not understand why I like wearing them so much, and gradually they get to know the reason. Some of them also become big fans for NBA jerseys like I am and always ask me out to buy new ones with them because I am an old hand and I can tell fake ones from authentic NBA jerseys.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Except for some formal occasion, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1qZXJzZXlzc2hvcC5jb20vbmJhLWplcnNleS1jLTI4Lmh0bWwmcXVvdDsgdGl0bGU9JnF1b3Q7amVyc2V5cyBuYmE_" target="_blank">jerseys nba</a> can be worn anywhere anytime. For me, I like wearing my favorite team's jerseys and watching their games in summer. They are comfortable and cool, more importantly, they can give people the feeling that they are fighting along with them in the same uniform on the ground. What's more, NBA jerseys can also go well with other clothes. For instance, without having to wear thick jeans, you can put on a pair of NBA shorts under a simple white T-shirt while going out to have a walk.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;In the spare time, finally I have got the chance to take off the boring and uncomfortable suit which I have to wear at work, and put on my favorite NBA shorts and shirts to have a basketball match with a couple of close friends. It is interesting that we can be divided into two parties, some friends and I like Chicago Bulls very much, and the other guys are supporters for Denver N&lt;a alt=&quot;discount jerseys&quot; title=&quot;discount jerseys&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cheap-jerseysshop.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-jerseysshop.com</a>]discount jerseys[/url]ets. As long as I put my Michael Jordan jerseys on, which gives me the feeling that I am the King of basketball and I can defeat my opponents easily. It can bring me more confidence and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Now in the market, there are more and more fake NBA jerseys and here are my ways to distinguish them from&amp;nbsp; NBA <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1qZXJzZXlzc2hvcC5jb20mcXVvdDsgdGl0bGU9JnF1b3Q7ZGlzY291bnQgamVyc2V5cw__" target="_blank">discount jerseys</a>. The logo of NBA, the player's name and number are computer embroidery and the workmanship is very exquisite. Authentic NBA jerseys use black ground paper so it looks beautiful and the fake ones always use white ground paper. Also the embroidery on fake ones will have fewer needles than authentic ones. What's more, characters on the authentic ones are even and fluent, while the fake ones will be very coarse. Another point many people may overlook is that the front part of authentic jerseys is longer than the backside.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

In general, they usually go on for about 2-3 days and only feature a small and limited number of items. As a result, they usually sell out very quickly so it is imperative to shop quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;To begin with, you need to recognize even though the word &amp;quot;sample&amp;quot; is used in the sale, in the majority of incidences, you are actually not purchasing just samples. You are buying actual handbags from specific designer lines that your favourite designers create. Online sample sales are sought after by up-and-coming as well as top grand name designers because it provides brand name exposure and allows them to also sell out when there is a surplus of particular items. Furthermore, a designer can also utilize these sample events to unload the previous season's merchandise quickly.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;On interesting aspect of online type sales are the need for exclusive invitation codes. To participate in these designer events, in most cases, you are required to be invited. The benefit to needing an invitation code to participate in the sale is that only a limited number of buyers are allowed to view and access the site which guarantees that all the users who are on the site are actual buyers.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;To maintain and be updated with the latest information sign up for daily sale reminders from the site if they provide such a service or function. Each website should allow you to opt-in for daily email reminders so you are aware which sales will begin at the start of each day. This is crucial for brand name bargain hunters who want to buy their items straight away as soon as a sample sale begins. For the majority of these savvy sales sites they will send you an email where you do not even have to click on to view the details of the sale as most of them already include it right in the body of the message either in text of HTML format with pictures. For the more established sites with exclusive content they may require you to pay a small annual fee to receive access to their sample sales but they are worth it in the amount of savings you will obtain from their events.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;If you are fortunate to find a reliable and trustworthy supplier make sure to shop as soon as each sale begins.
