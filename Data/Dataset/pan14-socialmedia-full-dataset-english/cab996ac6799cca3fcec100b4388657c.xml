<br />RENEWED  H&amp;MR MOBILISATION
<br />Dear Friends in Solidarity,                ,                                       3rd November 2009
<br />Jai Insaan, Jai Hind and Jai Jagath.
<br /><br />I need a hard core of 100 E-friends to be Karmayogis in my People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission. A Karmayogi in my opinion is one who is willing to give reasonable contribution in terms of body, mind and material resources to the needy neighbours in this global Humanistic Society- Vasudaika Kutumbam. 
<br />They shall from among them and all others mobilize…
<br />1.	Minimum Rs.25, 000.00 from among themselves and more from others.
<br />2.	Volunteers to give time from their sweet home.
<br />3.	As many Volunteers to visit the Eastern Ghats and Dandakaranya for days, weeks, months and as long as they desire and can afford “at no cost’ in the field. 
<br />I am sixty and on an unbeaten path both in my personal and professional life – both of which are the same to me, since 1973. I started as a Volunteer at Hyderabad in student life in 1966 and exhorted by Baba Amte, plunged as a one person army on the 15th August 1973 to set my journey to live with tribal communities in the Eastern Ghats with initial base at Bhadrachalam town village.
<br />In 1975, I shifted my base right in more interior Chatti village of Chintur Village of Khammam District on the banks of river Sabari, a tributary to River Godavari. This village is located just around less than five Kilometers from Orissa and Chattishgarh. All these years, I was an absolute volunteer depending upon friends and the tribal communities for my livelihood and I had a team of tribal youth as colleagues.
<br />In 1977, we formed the first formal Organisation called Girijana Seema Welfare Association – GSWA and started getting foreign funds. Over the years, I realized that we Voluntary Organisation got converted into NGOs and not only lost the spiritual value but many in the sector have become fraud and corrupt. To my pride and cooperation of my colleagues, on honesty part, we remained corruption and fraud free. But, we lost the voluntary instincts as a team and started depending upon the foreign funds, instead of the communities. We literally became employer and employees. 
<br />Over the years, beside GSWA, a vibrant initiative called Chaitanya Shravanthi –CS was formed by my late wife Smt.V.B.Mani in 1983. 
<br />I realized the great stress and fatigue in the last years from 2004.
<br />I have now declared my self as a one person Mission called People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission, since November 2008. 
<br />•	I do wish to influence the entire lot of convert NGOs, beginning with GSWA and CS to become true Voluntary Organisation or Community Based Voluntary Organisation, retaining the spiritual content of Humanism. 
<br />•	A system of Internal Accounting and Audit made collectively towards self accreditation. We need corruption and fraud free Voluntary Sector.
<br />•	Gurukulams to enable Adivasi Children learn and except few exceptions work towards the enrichment of their area and community.
<br />•	Eastern Ghats and Dandakaranya are declared Peace Zones for all.
<br />With the now looming War declared by our Indian State upon our own Citizens to flush out and arrest or kill the Maoists, we are afraid that thousands civilians will be killed and hundreds of women raped…Ah La Srilankan operation against LTTE. It is a maddening nightmare to even think that this could be soon happening.
<br />WE SHOULD LEARN FROM MANY OTHERS ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE, GET INVOLVED AND INVOLVE THEM IN BRINGING A LASTING SOLUTION.
<br />I am “crazy…lazy…difficult” to handle, unable to write professionally, I pour emotion etc. I need Help even to effectively communicate.
<br />With High Regards,,
<br />V.B.Chandrasekaran,
<br />People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission,

<br />GURUKULAM AT GUDEM
<br />IMPROVED/UPDATED CONCEPT NOTE CUM ACTION PLAN
<br />Title: 
<br />Community Based Learning Centre Led and Managed by its Children
<br /><br />It is a centre of excellence where Children pass in formal examinations in English Medium with first class. They normally speak in their Mother Tongue + Telugu. They can converse in Hindi as well. They will also be using computers.
<br />•	This shall be refined true traditional Gurukulam innovated to the changed scenario, without loosing the genesis of Gurukulam.
<br />Initial strategic target:
<br /><br />By the end of 10 to not more than 12 years, it is hoped that Children from the Panchayath or the Mandal would be passing out the school in 10th and intermediate classes. Every year, we expect 25 students to pass in each of these examinations. In the normal course, we expect that there will be no drop out or “mediocre” Youth by that time in the area. 
<br /><br />Email: <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=verivaan2049@yahoo.com">verivaan2049@yahoo.com</a> <a href="/go/messages/send/receiver=bragadambal@yahoo.co.in">bragadambal@yahoo.co.in</a>
<br /><br />But, to begin with, to augment local human resources, to meet the present need of providing Education to the drop out Youth (and ourselves to learn for improved future orientation <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> we shall enroll children as follows:-
<br />1.	25 pre-school and primary school children from Gudem Panchayath as day scholars.
<br />2.	50 drop out Youth from the area of membership of GSWA (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> and CS. 
<br /><br />Salient features of the Gurukulam:
<br />1.	Gurukulam will be the core activity of an eventual Vasudaika Kutubam, visualized in the designated area/campus/hamlet or even Panchayath like Anandwan of Varora, Maharashtra. 
<br />2.	The Centre would initially and eventually have active interaction with the Local Self Governance- Panchayaths and Mandal Parishads to mobilize resources. We will welcome resources, if directly provided by the Local Bodies. But, we shall never accept bulk resources or Project funds from either the Government or any one agency.
<br />3.	We want to explore the true original meaning of words and concepts like begging, annadanam, prasadam, biksham, adugukotam, unchavrithi, trusteeship, shram dan, community initiatives, charity etc and follow them to raise resources. 
<br />•	In our opinion, these are sacred duties and responsibilities of people in the frame work of sharing and not giving/taking/subsidy relationship. 
<br />•	GSFoundation will facilitate from without the target area, as a top up and back up mechanism.
<br />•	PPPM will act within the target area, to mobilize such resources. 
<br />•	GSFoundation and PPPM will work in close coordination and mutual information sharing.
<br />4.	For the present V.B.Chandrasekaran will be the main GURU. We welcome few more to join him as absolute Volunteers.
<br />5.	We will not have any paid staff employed as teachers or any other functions of the Gurukulam. The senior among the learners will take this responsibility. For learning we could come back with the students organizing group studies taking help of libraries etc. 
<br />6.	The children will constitute as “Children’s’ Parliament” and manage the Governance of the Gurukulam. GURU will proactively perform the role of the President. Initially, the Parliament- Lok Sabha, will meet for one day every month.
<br />7.	Similarly, a Rajya Sabha will be constituted to guide the Lok Sabha in the Governance of Gurukulam. Rajya Sabha will consist of the Volunteers joining Chandrasekaran, interested members from GSFoundation, few academicians/volunteers and professionals from other Voluntary Organisations. Rajya Sabha will meet ever month, before Lok Sabha. (All these members need not attend every meeting. It is desired that they attend at least 3 meetings in the year) 
<br />8.	While, it is always desirable to have consensus, but it may not be possible or even initially desirable, because such consensus could be the influence of one person or Chandrasekaran- this will be highly counter productive. We should set a process of eventually evolving collective and shared thinking to reach this ideal situation of consensus. Till such time, it will be documented and by open voting system, Governance will be decided.  Chandrasekaran will not preside either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. 
<br />9.	There will be no classes… one to ten or twelve. They will be in “packs” or any similar formation of 10 members each.
<br />10.	Every one is a teacher and learner. We will have supportive audio visuals, effective library and other innovations like guided tours, picnics, adventure etc. 
<br />11.	Every one will speak (and even watch) only in English and during that time it is deemed they do not know other languages- except in language classes or such essentials for meeting the challenge of formal examinations. 
<br />12.	The period is yet to be decided. For three (or six months) before the formal examination (10th or inter), we will have drilling classes by professional teachers employed as Volunteers (A strategic compromise could be some one or GSFoundation pays and sponsors such teachers).
<br />13.	Otherwise, the process will be to play and enjoy learning. No punishments or scolding, except in the Children’s Parliament. 
<br />14.	Learning by practice will be encouraged.
<br />15.	We would organize visiting lectures encourage visitors to spend time with our children…conscious of enabling their learning. 
<br />16.	Normally enrolled children should pass 10th Class at the age of 14-15 and inter 16-17. 
<br />17.	Drop out Youth will undergo a process of counseling and examination to assess their present competencies and enrolled with a letter indicating the number of years they will have to learn for appearing in the examination to pass in one go and in first class.
<br />18.	There will be no fees charged for any student. Even their examination and other fees paid by the Gurukulam Community- Vasudaika Kutumbam. 
<br />Non-Negotiables… (even by the above Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha…but improvable)
<br />1.	No fees will be charged for learning.
<br />2.	No one is employed on payment of salaries directly by the Gurukulam.
<br />3.	Resource from the Community or Local bodies, but not through the Government or agencies.
<br />4.	Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha based Governance.

<br />I may influence, but I shall never take any administrative or executive responsibilities in any Project or Organisation in the rest of my life. Nor I will seek a vote in any formation. Nor I will handle any funds. 
<br /><br />1.	Invitation to PRAXIS to locate in our area as PRAXIS target area and community.
<br /><br />May I insist and invite that PRAXIS establish a field establishment located at Paderu (Visakha District) and/or Bhadrachalam (Khammam District), with the following justification of the need.
<br />•	These are areas inhabited by over 95% of Adivasi communities belonging to the erstwhile fourth world.
<br />•	Ten Mandals affecting over two lakhs of Koya Adivasi community will be displaced out of their lands, culture and identity- by the possible construction of Indira Sagar Damn ( popularly called Polavaram Damn) across River Godavari. With the unfortunate exit of the strong “leader” Sri.Rajashekar Reddy, the possibilities of at least substantially reducing the height of the damn are now bright. Can we damn the Dam?
<br />•	The State WAR- violence, ironically in the name of a Peace meaning initiative “Salwa Jhudum” in the bordering Chattishgarh (No border is seen by the Koya Adivasis living in these areas) thousands of Internally Displaced Persons in Andhra Pradesh – On lines with Australian Stolen Children (or is it lost Children), children from Chattishgarh separated and brought to Andhra Pradesh, with the plan to induce elders to move out and give their lands to mining lobby in Chattishgarh. All in the name of crushing Maoists, who are also on a violent rampage? We need to respond and bring Peace and Prosperity in this land.
<br />•	Actively proposed bauxite mining in Visakha District depriving and dispossessing the Adivasis of their wealth, culture and land.
<br />•	You have a ground level supporting contact in me and two ‘major’ organisations- Girijana Seema Welfare Association and Chaitanya Shravanthi first to be established in Khammam and Visakha Districts respectively with wide contacts among various small and big initiatives. 
<br />•	Therefore, strategically an ideal and needy area to promote and nurture participatory Democracy.
<br />2.	Grass Root PRAXIS – Institute for Participatory Practices- including Democracy.
<br />I feel an urge for alternate Education – folk schools- Gurukulams to impart learning in the Adivasi Children and Youth culturally, educationally and politically/participatory democratically as key Human Resource Development need towards development. In my understanding PRAXIS is imparting this learning to macro level development practitioners in the Voluntary Organisations. Can PRAXIS go further to train the ultimate grass root development practitioners among the Adivasi communities? 
<br />•	Those few exceptions are needed, but all the other youth must live in their area and govern themselves, find livelihood in their lands should be the objective of these trainings. 
<br />We have the basic resource in the form of lands/campuses at Chatti, Chinthur and Gudem for establishing this venture. These should nurture the Adivasi citizens to Democratically take on the so-called development activities that in effect dispossess and displace them. 
<br />We need to review C.R. Das’s biography of the Danish Educational Innovator, Kirsten Kold and other experiments, develop/ reorient our present tools of Participation as course to the Youth in these institutes.
<br />3.	Voluntary Organisation and Volunteerism.
<br /><br />3.1.	There is a need to revisit and reinforcing our identity as organisations and Volunteers, not excluding the paid staff we may need to employ with due credit to them. I suggest Praxis to initiative a study, analyse historically and attempt to bring out a broad frame work of common consensus. The following are few of my initial reflections and home work to initiative the study. 
<br /><br />Primarily, the Voluntary Organisation is a common structure for small and informal community based initiatives for rendering certain common services or building assets that an individual in the community do not exclusively need or can either afford to have/perform. It is a product of common law- traditional practices/conventions and is not necessarily regulated by statute. 
<br />One common thread that continues to remain is that such an initiative does not benefit (profit) one person/family or benefits one by one but to all in the community, in course of years. Even the statute subsequently made by modern governments like the one as Public Society, was and remains very flexible and citizen friendly. 
<br />•	The popular understanding is that a Volunteer works ‘free’- shares at no cost, without taking any remuneration or compensation or salary.
<br />•	All the assets made by the initiative belong to the community. Local Self Governance/Panchayath has a control and check over them. 
<br />•	Often these were lands, buildings and even corpus managed by trustees, with well governed norms and ethics. These cannot be eventually in any event enjoyed by the Volunteers/staff or their children, in the organisation.
<br />•	These were supplements to the efforts of the State…the Government, by not depending upon the Government for resources…and these are Independent of State controls… and for that matter, should be Independent of Donor controls. 
<br />•	An ideal strategy would be that a Voluntary Organisations works only through local bodies-, who collect taxes, gets funds from the Government and even donors. Like the State Government, the Local Bodies should be able to get funds from even foreign donors. 
<br />•	In a sublime situation, The State should keep itself out of all these activities, including taxation for this purpose. State may have merely regulatory statutes. And allow freedom for Voluntary Organisations and the Local Panchayaths / Local self governance at different levels to mind it as their business.
<br /><br />•	That it is essential they network is natural flow of “Participatory Democratic Culture” from the grass root. Ironically, the cooperatives played such a role of strengthening grass root democracy, which were made ‘failures’ by centralized power brokers. 
<br /><br />3.2.	Similarly these is a need to redefine a Volunteer, going in-depth to various developments in Religious Institutions and classical Artists, who composed and practiced arts as Volunteers. The following are few of my initial reflections and home work to initiative the study
<br /><br />I quote the personal letter written by Sri.G.Narayana, a Gandhian Friend...
<br />1.	Gandhi asked his workers to adopt a Community/area and do constructive work like Khadi, provide services such as Medicare, giving tuitions, teaching Hindi etc… and find livelihood. The constructive workers used to take care of political workers’ families whenever they were put in jails.
<br />2.	Vinoba Bhave asked the Sarvodaya workers to adopt 200 families live with them, introduce Sarvodaya Patras. The families were persuaded to everyday take a pledge to serve the society on Sarvodaya Principles and contribute a fistful of grains or small cash to support the Sarvodaya worker to carry on the movement. Such contributions would take care of their expenses. 
<br />3.	The movement would become a People’s Movement, with their Participation, owned by them and thus the Community gets totally involved.
<br /><br />We have Voluntary Organisations like Servants of People Society and Servants of India Society started with lofty ideals and I quote what Lala Lajpat Roy (not in his own same words) said “A Volunteer is one who opts to lead a life Voluntarily Just above the Poverty line of the area/community they want to serve”.
<br />While Religion provided Monasteries, Mutts, Convents, Gurudwaras, Madarasas etc can we think of a real Extended PRAXIS Commune of Volunteers providing assurance of dignified livelihood to those volunteers- The Humanist Missionaries 
<br /><br />4.	Net working of ongoing initiatives in the above two geopolitical areas (No.1)
<br />It was the years of Urban Rural divide of Rich/Development and Poverty/the exploited. We were the first to start initiatives in late seventies and early eighties, in these areas. Many of us were drawn from urban area motivated by Marxism, Gandhian Philosophies and exhorted by people like Baba Amte to plunge, live with the communities and develop them. This was out understanding and tool for participation, in those years.
<br />•	We were few in number and called ourselves Voluntary Organisations. Today, there is a mushrooming of NGOs and ironically we have hundreds of Adivasi led NGOs as shoddy imitations of our initiatives being propped up by our clan or started on their own, with hopes of getting “Foreign Funds”. 
<br />•	Today, the divide has shifted within the communities and even families in our area. India is rich but Bharath is poor. Similarly, our area is getting richer while the pooooor is increasing in number and poverty increasing the toll. 
<br />And there are thousands of CBOs/SHGs for both by Government VELUGU and NGOs. There are different CBOs/SHGs in the same village dividing the individuals and communities. Many are formed by religious based NGOs. 
<br />We need to influence all these GOs and NGOs and above all the communities to….
<br />•	Be liberated to become independent Voluntary Organisations or Non Profit companies or Cooperatives. 
<br />•	Traditional Forms of informal Participatory methods explored giving formal innovation.
<br />•	Is Secular in development domain and religion remaining in the personal domain? 
<br />All these Human Forces are networked and unleashed to usher in nearer to ideal Participatory Democracy and Culture in the area in new models and modules.
<br /><br />The relationship of all these initiatives should be diverted from the State- the Government and fixed to the Local Governance.
<br />5.	Internal Accounts and Audit mechanism established for self accreditation of Organisations, even Institutions and even Local Self Governance … established and re-established  as an output/outcome of our initiatives.
<br /><br />“Do not insult a Volunteer by asking accounts. A Good Volunteer must maintain meticulous accounts on day to day basis for every paisa they get as contribution. The accounts should be available for everyone to know at any time of the day” Baba Amte and Gandhi combined.
<br /><br />A note sent by Girijana Seema Welfare Association to HelpAge India as a response to their format for making application to them gor funding under their new policy explains this.
<br /><br />6.	Conclusion
<br />I conclude this note of agenda with the following boxed rhetorics.
<br /><br />SOME RHETORIC… We mean to put in real action
<br /><br />1.	We need to reform and make it worldwide people’s movement of self governance of freedom and independence. People’s participation is possible in real terms, only if they have control over resources.
<br />2.	We need to follow up and implement our great workshop09 findings in action.
<br />3.	If terrorism can become world wide why not we make peace a world wide development movement. No rhetoric it is, let us make it.
<br />4.	I have a blue print road map. Sharing with that needs us to join hands. Let us make it possible. 
<br />5.	A new religion of humanism. Global self governance.
<br />6.	Redevelop and innovate new tools of People’s Participation.
<br />7.	Participatory Democracy as self declared republics is legally possible.
<br />8.	Parallel or supplementary structures to local self governance.

<br />[/b]<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>
<br />SaG Programme 2010-2013- HelpAge India.
<br /><br />A FORWARD LOOKING RESPONSE APPLICABLE TO ALL OF US 
<br />FOR THE QUESTION IN THE PROJECT APPLICATION FORMAT …?!
<br /><br />Are you aware of any fraudulent activity within your organization within the last 5 years? How will you minimize the risk of fraudulent activity occurring in the future? 
<br /><br />1.	Fighting Corruption, starting from home should be on the top of the agenda. 
<br />•	We see in the present World dominated by active immorality, the community members in the Local Self Governance and also Government NGO Projects like VELUGU, people have learnt and are trained to be corrupt and commit frauds. The present scenario in the NGOs sector is not either a happy one. 
<br />2.	We fear that the visualized member driven CBOs/ Voluntary Organisations/NGOs may follow the path like the overall society. HelpAge India should begin with developing from day one An Independent “Internal” Audit organisation/s who is VO biased/supportive of the management needs with the only objective of weeding even the thought of corruption. 
<br />They should take the responsibility of hand holding and hand over of the accounting responsibility of their clients. There should be otherwise complete freedom for the management of the client organisation to spend the resources. Donors and professionalism in management should be tuned to such management requirements.  
<br />The present audit literally by donors through a tripartite agreement duplicates the statutory audit. It is not very healthy. Auditing the audited accounts by the statutory auditors becomes very inconvenient and wastage.
<br />But, let us hit at the bull.
<br />•	This Internal Audit needs legal support to take on if and when officials harass the organisation in Income Tax and FCRA matters. Often Organisations are constrained to bribe intelligence persons fearing cancellation of FCRA and Income Tax authorities.
<br />“Do not insult a Volunteer by asking accounts. A Good Volunteer must maintain meticulous accounts on day to day basis for every paisa they get as contribution. The accounts should be available for everyone to know at any time of the day” Baba Amte and Gandhi combined.
<br />This write up is triggered by the above driving maxim, which we desire to hold to our heart even after one thousand years.
<br /><br />A PROPOSED SUGGESTION TO MAINTAIN ETHICAL STANDARDS OF THE AUDIT OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS IS PRESENTED FOR DIALOGUE AND IMPROVEMENT.
<br /><br />1.	PREAMBLE:
<br />We have made an attempt in this brain storming write up to correct and improve our understanding of Audit and provide home work for the proposed Independent Internal Audit Organisation.  We are neither professional in accounts nor in Chartered Accountancy.
<br />This is an outcome/ practical wisdom of our early years Audit experiences, middle years and one in the recent years. During these years we had maintained high ethical standards of accounting with periodic hiccups which we partly overcame or partly succumbed or both, in the recent one decade.
<br />The highest value we hold and cherish is our freedom and Independence. We are afraid that we are gradually succumbing to not only fore go our Freedom and Independence to donors, but also gradually become corrupt. 
<br /><br />2.	OUR BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING OF BASICS OF AUDIT:
<br />We verify ourselves the clarity we have, the following questions are raised and answered with focus and sharpness. (The answers are “then” tuned to changed present scenario and status of Voluntary Sector.)
<br />	What is an Audit?
<br />It is agreement between the General Body of a Voluntary Organisation and a Certified Auditor. The auditor works primarily in the interest of the concerned Voluntary Organisation.
<br />	Whom the auditor is primary accountable for and report to?
<br />Under normal circumstances, the auditor is primarily accountable and report to all the members in the General Body. She/he does it through the CEO and President/Chairperson of the Organisation.
<br />2.3	On what authentic basis the above response is made?
<br />We say so because, it is mandatory that the General Body appoints an Auditor.
<br />2.4	Is auditor accountable to the Government?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Government. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client.
<br />2.5	Is auditor accountable to the Donor?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Donor. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client.
<br />2.6	Auditor Fees…?
<br />Voluntary Organisations pay far less than commercial organisations and there are cases where it is nominal and notional sum.
<br />2.7	What is that an auditor explicitly or implicitly by subtle silence, basically establishes and reports to the General Body?
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are not committing any fraud or utlising the resources for their personal benefit directly or indirectly.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are spending the resources for Lawful activities and transparently.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are spending the resources in the interest of the Organisation and Objectives set forth by the Organisation.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are maintaining the books/records of accounts and following the procedures that help any one establish the above reports with authenticity.
<br /><br />3	THE PRESENT STATUS WITH REFERENCE TO OUR BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING OF BASICS OF AUDIT- in the changed scenario.
<br />Some of the above question and answers are repeated and answered in the present context and reality.
<br />3.1.	What is an Audit?
<br />Operationally, it has become an agreement between the CEO and/or Executive Committee and a Certified Auditor. The auditor works primarily in the interest of the CEO and/or Executive Committee. 
<br /><br />3.2.	Whom the auditor is primary accountable for and report to?
<br />Under present circumstances, the auditor has become primarily accountable and report to the CEO only. In the early years of our audit, auditor would insist that the President of the organisation also signs the audit report. But, many organizations and auditors have bid bye to this practice. 
<br />3.3	Is auditor accountable to the Government?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Government. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client/s.
<br />3.4	Auditor Fees…?
<br />It is erratic and no broad standards set by Voluntary Sector. There are cases of Voluntary Organisations making huge payment. The payment sometimes is on par if not higher than in the Commercial sector.
<br />4	CORRUPTION CREEPING IN VOLUNTARY SECTOR VIA AUDIT???
<br />The following are the reality corrupt scenes we have experienced and visibly observed in our Voluntary Sector.
<br />4.1.	Auditor Fees…?
<br />We are working in non profit sector. WE claim tax benefits. Erratic and no broad standards set by Voluntary Sector, making huge payment and payment sometimes is on par if not higher than in the Commercial sector …means we are in profit sector, leading the popular public to perceive possible corruption. 
<br />•	And thus giving space for the Government to introduce draconian measures, affecting genuine Voluntary Organisation- like the one now before the Parliament.
<br />That this fees is decided by CEO and not discussed either in the General Body or even in the Executive Committee gives an impression of corruption. 
<br />4.2.	By Collusion… ?
<br />If the CEO is corrupt, she/he colludes to fudge the accounts. Sometimes, proactive Executive Committee (Board) members would become partners in this game, along with CEO.
<br />4.3.	By apprehension and sometimes real threat to Organisation… ?
<br />In the case of an unhealthy Tripartite agreement…!!!???
<br />•	The apprehension that auditor must give a good report pressurizes the CEO to surrender and bribe the auditor.
<br />•	CEO also surrenders when she/he acted in the interest of work and organisation made some needed adjustments in the accounts.
<br />•	Auditor can proactively become corrupt by pointing out even a mole of mistake as a mountain or subtly threaten to expose certain discrete CEO actions and politely demand bribe. CEO should yield to such demands in the interest of the organisation. 
<br />5	Proposed remedies to literally eliminate even the thought of corruption in the Voluntary Sector.
<br />Donors and Voluntary Organisations together  must prepare a broad panel of really Independent Auditors, from whom the Voluntary Organisations must appoint their auditors. The auditors willing to be empanelled must comply with the following practices.
<br />5.1	Some little flexible norms payment of fees including perks like accommodation etc at the time of audit should be prescribed for an audit.
<br />5.2	An Auditor possesses copies of basic records, including the annual reports as basis and contact details of all the General Body members with focus upon the Board.
<br /><br />5.3	Tripartite Audit agreement ‘between the Organisation, Donor and auditor’ is unhealthy and stopped. This amounts to proprietary audit questioning the core ‘trust between donor and implementing Voluntary Organisation’. 
<br /><br />5.4	The Auditor must attend the General Body meeting, introduced to the members and then appointed at the General Body meeting.
<br />5.5	The Auditor reports to the CEO and/or The Board about any prima fascia corruption, if any in the transactions of the organisation and gets specific response on the measures taken by the CEO.
<br />5.6	The Auditor facilitates and advices CEO and/or The Board in maintaining proper books of accounts and set of procedures. The advices are sent to the members of the General Body directly or through the President/CEO of the Organisation. She/he gets a compliance report or clarification regarding the difficulties in complying.
<br />5.7	An auditor goes through all the records and seeks information from the CEO for an authentic understanding of the status of accounts.
<br />5.8	The Auditor recommends the CEO and/or The Board in developing an internal audit mechanism, when needed. 
<br />5.9	The auditor must have acquaintance with all members of the Board and attend at least one of the Boards meeting in a year. It will be good that she/he also attend the General Body meeting for couple of hours, now and then.
<br />5.10	Bankers are invited for the General Body of an Organisation. It will be good, if at least one banker attends the meeting. 
<br />5.11	Final Audit report should be essentially signed by the President of the Organisation before auditor signs it. 
<br />5.12	Auditor submits her/his Observations for compliance at the time of Audit to all members of the General Body. Depending upon the nature of the observations, the General Body members are expected to give their feed back to the CEO and/or Board. After giving reasonable time for such response, CEO submits her/his compliance to the auditor.
<br />5.13	Auditor shall maintain the confidentiality of the client. He will be debarred from the panel, if she/he divulges even any minor detail to anybody including the donor, under normal circumstances.
<br />5.14	Auditor shall report to the donor giving a notice to the Client organisation, if the auditor has “substantial” doubt or authentic evidence that the CEO or Board members have enriched personally from the funds of the donor. 
<br />5.15	The final Audited report is sent by the auditor to all the members of the General Body. This is essential to maintain transparency both in look and in reality. 
<br />6	Independent Internal Audit System:
<br />In the overall interest of Voluntary or NGO sector and in the interest of getting rid of any corruption in the Voluntary sector from now on, it is desirable and ideal that All donors in some permutation and combination or individually take lead to initiate the process. 
<br />They must assure (something like free legal service of the Government) at no cost not only the audit proposed above but also the Independent Internal Audit to every Voluntary Organisation or NGO as a matter of their right, depending upon their resource position/real crunch. This service should be seen beyond Funding Partnership.
<br />For many Voluntary Organisations it is becoming very difficult to either get good accountants or they are able to afford one at higher cost. They go with mediocre accountant and not only suffer but also some times face humiliation. 
<br />Establish accredited Non Profit Internal Audit firm or as many of them depending upon the market.
<br />•	Those who can afford but do not get personnel shall meet the cost of this Internal Audit.
<br />•	For others, this service shall be at no cost.
<br />•	It is a process of Demonstration, Hand Holding and Hand Over to the client organisation complying with all audit norms. 
<br />•	It can also be one time or emergency support, when in a situation a particular (even well established) Voluntary Organisation or NGO.
<br />•	It is finally the responsibility of this company that client organisation maintain Good accounts, provided they get reasonable cooperation from the client. 
<br />•	The company shall finally finalize the accounts of the client on monthly, then quarterly and finally annual basis. 
<br />•	The actual details of logistics should be worked out between the company and client depending upon the specific needs. 
<br />7.	Conclusion:
<br />This literally amounts to a self regulatory system- A self accreditation, essential today to restore credibility in the Voluntary Organisations. We solicit suggestions to improve upon this write up keeping in mind our solemn commitment to the values of Freedom and Independence of the Voluntary Organisation and this is possible only in an atmosphere of self regulated responsibility.

<br />[/b]<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>
<br />SaG Programme 2010-2013- HelpAge India.
<br /><br />A FORWARD LOOKING RESPONSE APPLICABLE TO ALL OF US 
<br />FOR THE QUESTION IN THE PROJECT APPLICATION FORMAT …?!
<br /><br />Are you aware of any fraudulent activity within your organization within the last 5 years? How will you minimize the risk of fraudulent activity occurring in the future? 
<br /><br />1.	Fighting Corruption, starting from home should be on the top of the agenda. 
<br />•	We see in the present World dominated by active immorality, the community members in the Local Self Governance and also Government NGO Projects like VELUGU, people have learnt and are trained to be corrupt and commit frauds. The present scenario in the NGOs sector is not either a happy one. 
<br />2.	We fear that the visualized member driven CBOs/ Voluntary Organisations/NGOs may follow the path like the overall society. HelpAge India should begin with developing from day one An Independent “Internal” Audit organisation/s who is VO biased/supportive of the management needs with the only objective of weeding even the thought of corruption. 
<br />They should take the responsibility of hand holding and hand over of the accounting responsibility of their clients. There should be otherwise complete freedom for the management of the client organisation to spend the resources. Donors and professionalism in management should be tuned to such management requirements.  
<br />The present audit literally by donors through a tripartite agreement duplicates the statutory audit. It is not very healthy. Auditing the audited accounts by the statutory auditors becomes very inconvenient and wastage.
<br />But, let us hit at the bull.
<br />•	This Internal Audit needs legal support to take on if and when officials harass the organisation in Income Tax and FCRA matters. Often Organisations are constrained to bribe intelligence persons fearing cancellation of FCRA and Income Tax authorities.
<br />“Do not insult a Volunteer by asking accounts. A Good Volunteer must maintain meticulous accounts on day to day basis for every paisa they get as contribution. The accounts should be available for everyone to know at any time of the day” Baba Amte and Gandhi combined.
<br />This write up is triggered by the above driving maxim, which we desire to hold to our heart even after one thousand years.
<br /><br />A PROPOSED SUGGESTION TO MAINTAIN ETHICAL STANDARDS OF THE AUDIT OF VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS IS PRESENTED FOR DIALOGUE AND IMPROVEMENT.
<br /><br />1.	PREAMBLE:
<br />We have made an attempt in this brain storming write up to correct and improve our understanding of Audit and provide home work for the proposed Independent Internal Audit Organisation.  We are neither professional in accounts nor in Chartered Accountancy.
<br />This is an outcome/ practical wisdom of our early years Audit experiences, middle years and one in the recent years. During these years we had maintained high ethical standards of accounting with periodic hiccups which we partly overcame or partly succumbed or both, in the recent one decade.
<br />The highest value we hold and cherish is our freedom and Independence. We are afraid that we are gradually succumbing to not only fore go our Freedom and Independence to donors, but also gradually become corrupt. 
<br /><br />2.	OUR BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING OF BASICS OF AUDIT:
<br />We verify ourselves the clarity we have, the following questions are raised and answered with focus and sharpness. (The answers are “then” tuned to changed present scenario and status of Voluntary Sector.)
<br />	What is an Audit?
<br />It is agreement between the General Body of a Voluntary Organisation and a Certified Auditor. The auditor works primarily in the interest of the concerned Voluntary Organisation.
<br />	Whom the auditor is primary accountable for and report to?
<br />Under normal circumstances, the auditor is primarily accountable and report to all the members in the General Body. She/he does it through the CEO and President/Chairperson of the Organisation.
<br />2.3	On what authentic basis the above response is made?
<br />We say so because, it is mandatory that the General Body appoints an Auditor.
<br />2.4	Is auditor accountable to the Government?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Government. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client.
<br />2.5	Is auditor accountable to the Donor?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Donor. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client.
<br />2.6	Auditor Fees…?
<br />Voluntary Organisations pay far less than commercial organisations and there are cases where it is nominal and notional sum.
<br />2.7	What is that an auditor explicitly or implicitly by subtle silence, basically establishes and reports to the General Body?
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are not committing any fraud or utlising the resources for their personal benefit directly or indirectly.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are spending the resources for Lawful activities and transparently.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are spending the resources in the interest of the Organisation and Objectives set forth by the Organisation.
<br />•	The Auditor reports that the CEO and/or The Board are maintaining the books/records of accounts and following the procedures that help any one establish the above reports with authenticity.
<br /><br />3	THE PRESENT STATUS WITH REFERENCE TO OUR BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING OF BASICS OF AUDIT- in the changed scenario.
<br />Some of the above question and answers are repeated and answered in the present context and reality.
<br />3.1.	What is an Audit?
<br />Operationally, it has become an agreement between the CEO and/or Executive Committee and a Certified Auditor. The auditor works primarily in the interest of the CEO and/or Executive Committee. 
<br /><br />3.2.	Whom the auditor is primary accountable for and report to?
<br />Under present circumstances, the auditor has become primarily accountable and report to the CEO only. In the early years of our audit, auditor would insist that the President of the organisation also signs the audit report. But, many organizations and auditors have bid bye to this practice. 
<br />3.3	Is auditor accountable to the Government?
<br />Under normal circumstances, an auditor is not accountable to the Government. Auditor needs to maintain the confidentiality of the client/s.
<br />3.4	Auditor Fees…?
<br />It is erratic and no broad standards set by Voluntary Sector. There are cases of Voluntary Organisations making huge payment. The payment sometimes is on par if not higher than in the Commercial sector.
<br />4	CORRUPTION CREEPING IN VOLUNTARY SECTOR VIA AUDIT???
<br />The following are the reality corrupt scenes we have experienced and visibly observed in our Voluntary Sector.
<br />4.1.	Auditor Fees…?
<br />We are working in non profit sector. WE claim tax benefits. Erratic and no broad standards set by Voluntary Sector, making huge payment and payment sometimes is on par if not higher than in the Commercial sector …means we are in profit sector, leading the popular public to perceive possible corruption. 
<br />•	And thus giving space for the Government to introduce draconian measures, affecting genuine Voluntary Organisation- like the one now before the Parliament.
<br />That this fees is decided by CEO and not discussed either in the General Body or even in the Executive Committee gives an impression of corruption. 
<br />4.2.	By Collusion… ?
<br />If the CEO is corrupt, she/he colludes to fudge the accounts. Sometimes, proactive Executive Committee (Board) members would become partners in this game, along with CEO.
<br />4.3.	By apprehension and sometimes real threat to Organisation… ?
<br />In the case of an unhealthy Tripartite agreement…!!!???
<br />•	The apprehension that auditor must give a good report pressurizes the CEO to surrender and bribe the auditor.
<br />•	CEO also surrenders when she/he acted in the interest of work and organisation made some needed adjustments in the accounts.
<br />•	Auditor can proactively become corrupt by pointing out even a mole of mistake as a mountain or subtly threaten to expose certain discrete CEO actions and politely demand bribe. CEO should yield to such demands in the interest of the organisation. 
<br />5	Proposed remedies to literally eliminate even the thought of corruption in the Voluntary Sector.
<br />Donors and Voluntary Organisations together  must prepare a broad panel of really Independent Auditors, from whom the Voluntary Organisations must appoint their auditors. The auditors willing to be empanelled must comply with the following practices.
<br />5.1	Some little flexible norms payment of fees including perks like accommodation etc at the time of audit should be prescribed for an audit.
<br />5.2	An Auditor possesses copies of basic records, including the annual reports as basis and contact details of all the General Body members with focus upon the Board.
<br /><br />5.3	Tripartite Audit agreement ‘between the Organisation, Donor and auditor’ is unhealthy and stopped. This amounts to proprietary audit questioning the core ‘trust between donor and implementing Voluntary Organisation’. 
<br /><br />5.4	The Auditor must attend the General Body meeting, introduced to the members and then appointed at the General Body meeting.
<br />5.5	The Auditor reports to the CEO and/or The Board about any prima fascia corruption, if any in the transactions of the organisation and gets specific response on the measures taken by the CEO.

<br />5.8	The Auditor recommends the CEO and/or The Board in developing an internal audit mechanism, when needed. 
<br />5.9	The auditor must have acquaintance with all members of the Board and attend at least one of the Boards meeting in a year. It will be good that she/he also attend the General Body meeting for couple of hours, now and then.
<br />5.10	Bankers are invited for the General Body of an Organisation. It will be good, if at least one banker attends the meeting. 
<br />5.11	Final Audit report should be essentially signed by the President of the Organisation before auditor signs it. 
<br />5.12	Auditor submits her/his Observations for compliance at the time of Audit to all members of the General Body. Depending upon the nature of the observations, the General Body members are expected to give their feed back to the CEO and/or Board.

<br />Establish accredited Non Profit Internal Audit firm or as many of them depending upon the market.
<br />•	Those who can afford but do not get personnel shall meet the cost of this Internal Audit.
<br />•	For others, this service shall be at no cost.
<br />•	It is a process of Demonstration, Hand Holding and Hand Over to the client organisation complying with all audit norms. 
<br />•	It can also be one time or emergency support, when in a situation a particular (even well established) Voluntary Organisation or NGO.
<br />•	It is finally the responsibility of this company that client organisation maintain Good accounts, provided they get reasonable cooperation from the client. 
<br />•	The company shall finally finalize the accounts of the client on monthly, then quarterly and finally annual basis. 
<br />•	The actual details of logistics should be worked out between the company and client depending upon the specific needs. 
<br />7.	Conclusion:
<br />This literally amounts to a self regulatory system- A self accreditation, essential today to restore credibility in the Voluntary Organisations. We solicit suggestions to improve upon this write up keeping in mind our solemn commitment to the values of Freedom and Independence of the Voluntary Organisation and this is possible only in an atmosphere of self regulated responsibility.

<br />IT IS A WAR AGAINT OUR OWN CITIZENS.
<br />Shall we remain as silent spectators when the Indian State has declared a war on our Citizens, to eliminate Maoists violence on this sacred land? I am afraid that our Government is taking queue from Srilankan eliminating LTTE militarily? The war has begun and will become fully operationalised in the coming few days. 
<br />It is an irony the operation is called Green Hunt or something like that, reminding the violence propagated by the Salwa Jhudum- meaning Peace March, Shanthi Yatra- A force created by the Government of Chattisgarh initially with the stated objective of organizing the tribal youth as Citizens initiative to resist all violence with focus upon the Maoists, in the new millennium.
<br /><br />TO THE INDIAN MAOISTS
<br /><br />Mao Ste Tung to then Maoists… the Telangana Communists!!!
<br />When at the time of Indian Freedom, the communists from Telangana approached Mao Tse Tung for support to liberate Telangana; Mao was a genuine communist willing to extend all the support without National Borders. But, he raised two basic questions to those who sought his support…
<br />•	I can send all the arms for you. But, how do I send them, without a sea coast in Telangana? 
<br />•	The Indians are with high expectation of enjoying new found freedom they just got from the Imperialist British rule. Therefore, the Indian Citizens will not extend cooperation to the communists in the struggle at that time.
<br />Our present Maoists… to listen to veterans like Lavanam or even Castro!!!
<br />Mao is not alive. May be Maoists can contact the veteran Fiedal Castro or any other similar World Communist leader, for advice, if not for arms. 
<br />Well, we have another veteran Freedom Fighter, Humanist and Atheist in Lavanam who have Volunteered his advice to both the Maoists and the Politician-rulers of India. His passionate open letters are enclosed by attachment.
<br />Shall we passionately ask the Maoists???!!!
<br />As comrades with similar Humanist passion, we must ask the following questions and share the statement with the Maoists.
<br />1.	Green Salam to Maoists. Maoists deserve all our appreciation for their sense of love for the poor, the Adivasis and sacrifice since the beginning of Naxalbari Movement. 
<br />2.	We acknowledge the valid role played by the Naxalites all these years in protecting the Tribal Communities from the possible loot both by the State, Land Lords and contractors, all these years. They were instrumental in drawing the attention of the Government to the plight of Adivasi Communities in the Dandakaranya and Eastern Ghats.
<br />3.	The guerilla war waged by Vietnam was won because they were homogenous country, small in size and there was a clear external enemy, But, India is a huge country nurturing many religions, culture, ethnicity and above all with strong Democratic Institutions. The Indian State has too many faces that we cannot identify one focused enemy. 
<br />4.	The World appreciated the various movements and identified them as Freedom and Liberation struggles. LTTE, the Palestinian struggle and many such struggles got support by different means. Even their initial violent means got justified and appreciated as essential. This violence played the role of drawing the attention of the world community.
<br />5.	With the emerging Jihad culture, crusades and International Police cum State and even UN sponsored violence, the perpetuation of violence after all these years by these struggles is gradually perceived by the World Community as Terrorism. 
<br />6.	The Centralised Socialist State of U.S.S.R stands broken back to the original smaller States.
<br />7.	The Vulgar Capitalism stands exposed. Many of these capitalists States are soul searching for solutions to the melting economies. India still stands with a smile of managing our economy better. 
<br />8.	The LTTE with vast International Tamil Diaspora stands militarily smashed by tiny Srilankan Army more because of this changing perception from one of Freedom struggle to Terrorism. 
<br />9.	Even Passionate but rugged looking  Revolutionary Balladeer Gaddar has changed to suave looking style… his dress changed to pure peace making white and fully dressed, blackened his white hairs, and trimmed the mushtache… at least with concern to remove the bullet- a mark of violence hiding in his body. 
<br /><br />(I am not able to get his new photo. But try seeing Gaddar in full white kurta and all hairs blackened and trimmed.) 
<br />10.	Please look around at the totally rapid changing scenario, in your own Dandakaranya. With exceptions, there are educated Youth even in the remote tribal hamlets. All of them are aspired by globalised Prosperity (though we all perceive this as both vulgar and future devastating in nature), the multiple TV channels dished out by the tiny dish in their compounds, speeding two wheelers, Colgate brushing their teeth, fair and lovely charming both men and women etc. It is painful to observe the self displacement of youth who are no keener to continue with their wretched cultivation but migrate to urban centres in search of jobs. 
<br />11.	All these years the tribal communities supported you. But, in the recent years, for all these reasons and their own growing material aspirations, this is no more a voluntary support in the recent years. You cannot win and bring revolution with an army where even children are forced to be soldiers. Your guns cannot perpetually silence the tribal communities and get their support more out of fear.  
<br />12.	India has so far failed to provide corruption and fraud free governance. But, the strength and efficiency of our Democratic Institutions have provided opportunities for people to change the government through ballot. We have shamed mighty America to say that we are better in democracy. Even communist parties have gained power continuously through ballots. Yes, we have the unfinished task to nurture Democratic Culture.
<br />13.	In 70s and 80s, we the Educated and many elite Youth admired Naxalites with great respect. Many of us joined you or extended support from outside. Most of us and even those who never had Marxian inclination still appreciated Naxalites for their doing good to the poor and oppressed tribal communities. Many of us were thrilled by your courage and willingness to sacrifice and felt ashamed that we ourselves were cowards. Today, in the context of terrorism in different parts of the country, many do not hold similar values to Maoist?!
<br />14.	Again, Green Salam to Maoists. You have fulfilled your role all these years. Do not dream of winning a war now. The strategy must change. The goals of OUR revolution must be reset.
<br />15.	Yes, there are few major unfinished agenda. .   You can fulfill them only with the cooperation of Democratic forces outside. 
<br />16.	We need to address the issue of Self Rule to Adivasi Indian Citizens, their absolute control over their resources and do not get displaced by major Dams. 
<br /><br />TO THE INDIAN STATE
<br />Offensive Civil War like resolution of internal conflicts… the Maoists Violence, within a Democratic Country is not acceptable. We cannot allow our Citizens to be killed and raped by our own military or even paramilitary forces. Our armed forces cannot be allowed to fight their own Citizen. 
<br />India is a Land of Peace- 
<br />Follow the path of Gandhi, the Satyagraha.
<br />•	Our Adivasi Indian Citizens are not Red Indians or Aborigines, who discovered invading Europeans who in turn called them as barbarians and uncivilized people without culture. The initial Imperial Europeans in the process killed them, raped their women and converted them to Christianity. All to control over the rich resources of Red Indians and Aborigines… their forests, land, water, mines and minerals.
<br />•	True, The Indian State cannot imitate the European settlers to unleash IntraNational Imperialism and Colonialism on the Adivasi Indian Citizens for similar goals.
<br />•	We are a land where Buddha gave up his empire; Ashoka gave up war and violence, Mahavira and many such saints.
<br />•	In the modern world our Mahatma Gandhi led and we gave the world the religion of Peace and Satyagraha to even achieve freedom from the mighty British. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandella followed our path to liberate Negros and their country from racialism. 
<br />•	Even Gandhi would not say “NO’ to defensive violence if Maoists or anyone indulges in violence. Please do it and we are with you. 
<br />•	But, this operation Green hunt is not acceptable to all informed Indian Citizens. 
<br /><br />TO THE INFORMED INDIAN CITIZENS
<br />ALL OVER INDIA AND WORLD. 
<br /><br />Figure 1. She is an orphan with parents, the looming threat has driven her out of her parents. 
<br />Dated: 29th October 2009
<br />Arise, Awake and Stop not till we achieve Peace. It will be symbolizing our action if Lavanam can be a part in our team of leaders. If Lavanam…meaning Salt Satyagraha was for liberation and freedom of India, ours shall be “Asli” Salwa Jhudum…Peace March from the confluence of Sabari, Sileru and Godavari rivers. 
<br />We appreciate the commitment to the cause and the courage of hard core terrorists willing to be killed, while killing others. But, we believe it needs greater courage to be willing to be killed while no intention to kill others … the courage shown by Dhandi marchers showing their chest to bullets. 
<br />We need minimum One Hundred and hundreds more keep joining our march to Abhujiyamad. If we are hundred, we can start and I will be one of them. I and our organisations will provide base camp and our communities’ frugal hospitality. 
<br />Respond immediately….mail, start and join. We shall return only with Peace being made in the area.
<br /><br />JAI INSAAN, JAI HIND AND JAI JAGATH.

<br />All through these years, various intellectuals and right activists intervened in the issues relating to the Maoists. Both by the Government and the common opinion making public, the fact must be agreed is that they are perceived to be having sympathies and some sort of allegiance to Maoists and their leftist ideology. This is partly true, since any neutral observer would also believe that Civil liberties are not respected by Maoists too. 
<br />But, now the issue is different. Totally, different???!!!
<br />Shall we remain as silent spectators when the Indian State has declared a war on our Citizens, to eliminate Maoists violence on this sacred land? I am afraid that our Government is taking queue from Srilankan eliminating LTTE militarily? The war has begun …???!!!
<br />It is an irony the operation is called Green Hunt or something like that, reminding the violence propagated by the Salwa Jhudum- meaning Peace March, Shanthi Yatra- A force created by the Government of Chattisgarh initially with the stated objective of organizing the tribal youth as Citizens initiative to resist all violence with focus upon the Maoists, in the new millennium- this could be appropriately called Salwa Jhuloom.
<br />We need people of the moral stature like Jayaprakash Narayan who brought Peace with Bandits. We need Gandhian Dandi March and “Asli” Salwa Jhudum in place of Sarkari Salwa Jhuloom. In fact, Gandhian/Atheist and Social Worker Sri.Lavanam made an initiative by issuing public letters that went unnoticed by all and not appropriately responded by Maoists.
<br /><br />TO THE INDIAN MAOISTS
<br /><br />Mao Ste Tung to then Maoists… the Telangana Communists!!!
<br />When at the time of Indian Freedom, the communists from Telangana approached Mao Tse Tung for support to liberate Telangana; Mao was a genuine communist willing to extend all the support without National Borders. But, he raised two basic questions to those who sought his support…
<br />•	I can send all the arms for you. But, how do I send them, without a sea coast in Telangana? 
<br />•	The Indians are with high expectation of enjoying new found freedom they just got from the Imperialist British rule. Therefore, the Indian Citizens will not extend cooperation to the communists in the struggle at that time.
<br />Our present Maoists… to listen to veterans like Lavanam or even Castro!!!
<br />Mao is not alive. May be Maoists can contact the veteran Fiedal Castro or any other similar World Communist leader, for advice, if not for arms. 
<br />Well, we have another veteran Freedom Fighter, Humanist and Atheist in Lavanam who have Volunteered his advice to both the Maoists and the Politician-rulers of India. His passionate open letters are enclosed by attachment.
<br />Shall we passionately ask the Maoists???!!!
<br />As comrades with similar Humanist passion, we must ask the following questions and share the statement with the Maoists.
<br />1.	Green Salam to Maoists. Maoists deserve all our appreciation for their sense of love for the poor, the Adivasis and sacrifice since the beginning of Naxalbari Movement. 
<br />2.	We acknowledge the valid role played by the Naxalites all these years in protecting the Tribal Communities from the possible loot both by the State, Land Lords and contractors, all these years. They were instrumental in drawing the attention of the Government to the plight of Adivasi Communities in the Dandakaranya and Eastern Ghats.
<br />3.	The guerilla war waged by Vietnam was won because they were homogenous country, small in size and there was a clear external enemy, But, India is a huge country nurturing many religions, culture, ethnicity and above all with strong Democratic Institutions. The Indian State has too many faces that we cannot identify one focused enemy. 
<br />4.	The World appreciated the various movements and identified them as Freedom and Liberation struggles. LTTE, the Palestinian struggle and many such struggles got support by different means. Even their initial violent means got justified and appreciated as essential. This violence played the role of drawing the attention of the world community.
<br />5.	With the emerging Jihad culture, crusades and Internationally self assumed Policing State- the US and even UN sponsored violence, the perpetuation of violence after all these years by these struggles is gradually perceived by the World Community as Terrorism. 
<br />6.	The Centralised Socialist State of U.S.S.R stands broken back to the original smaller States.
<br />7.	The Vulgar Capitalism stands exposed. Many of these capitalists States are soul searching for solutions to the melting economies. India still stands with a smile of managing our economy better. 
<br />8.	The LTTE with vast International Tamil Diaspora stands militarily smashed by tiny Srilankan Army more because of this changing perception from one of Freedom struggle to Terrorism. 
<br />9.	Even Passionate but rugged looking  Revolutionary Balladeer Gaddar has changed to suave looking style… his dress changed to pure peace making white and fully dressed, blackened his white hairs, and trimmed the mushtache… at least with concern to remove the bullet- a mark of violence hiding in his body. 
<br />10.	Please look around at the totally rapid changing scenario, in your own Dandakaranya. With exceptions, there are educated Youth even in the remote tribal hamlets. All of them are aspired by globalised Prosperity (though we all perceive this as both vulgar and future devastating in nature), the multiple TV channels dished out by the tiny dish in their compounds, speeding two wheelers, Colgate brushing their teeth, fair and lovely charming both men and women etc. It is painful to observe the self displacement of youth who are no keener to continue with their wretched cultivation but migrate to urban centres in search of jobs. 
<br />11.	All these years the tribal communities supported you. But, in the recent years, for all these reasons and their own growing material aspirations, this is no more a voluntary support in the recent years. You cannot win and bring revolution with an army where even children are forced to be soldiers. Your guns cannot perpetually silence the tribal communities and get their support more out of fear.  
<br />12.	India has so far failed to provide corruption and fraud free governance. But, the strength and efficiency of our Democratic Institutions have provided opportunities for people to change the government through ballot. We have shamed mighty America to say that we are better in democracy. Even communist parties have gained power continuously through ballots. Yes, we have the unfinished task to nurture Democratic Culture.
<br />13.	In 70s and 80s, we the Educated and many elite Youth admired Naxalites with great respect. Many of us joined you or extended support from outside. Most of us and even those who never had Marxian inclination still appreciated Naxalites for their doing good to the poor and oppressed tribal communities. Many of us were thrilled by your courage and willingness to sacrifice and felt ashamed that we ourselves were cowards. Today, in the context of terrorism in different parts of the country, many do not hold similar values to Maoist?!
<br />14.	Again, Green Salam to Maoists. You have fulfilled your role all these years. Do not dream of winning a war now. The strategy must change. The goals of OUR revolution must be reset.
<br />15.	Yes, there are few major unfinished agenda. .   You can fulfill them only with the cooperation of Democratic forces outside. 
<br />16.	We need to address the issue of Self Rule to Adivasi Indian Citizens, their absolute control over their resources and do not get displaced by major Dams. 
<br /><br />TO THE INDIAN STATE
<br /><br />Offensive Civil War like resolution of internal conflicts… the Maoists Violence, within a Democratic Country is not acceptable. We cannot allow our Citizens to be killed and raped by our own military or even paramilitary forces. Our armed forces cannot be allowed to fight their own Citizen. 
<br />India is a Land of Peace- 
<br />Follow the path of Gandhi, the Satyagraha.
<br />•	Our Adivasi Indian Citizens are not Red Indians or Aborigines, who discovered invading Europeans who in turn called them as barbarians and uncivilized people without culture. The initial Imperial Europeans in the process killed them, raped their women and converted them to Christianity. All to control over the rich resources of Red Indians and Aborigines… their forests, land, water, mines and minerals.
<br />•	True, The Indian State cannot imitate the European settlers to unleash IntraNational Imperialism and Colonialism on the Adivasi Indian Citizens for similar goals.
<br />•	We are a land where Buddha gave up his empire; Ashoka gave up war and violence, Mahavira and many such saints.
<br />•	In the modern world our Mahatma Gandhi led and we gave the world the religion of Peace and Satyagraha to even achieve freedom from the mighty British. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandella followed our path to liberate Negros and their country from racialism. 
<br />•	Even Gandhi would not say “NO’ to defensive violence if Maoists or anyone indulges in violence. Please do it and we are with you. 
<br />•	But, this operation Green hunt is not acceptable to all Informed, peace loving and Democratic Indian Citizens. 
<br /><br />TO THE INFORMED INDIAN CITIZENS
<br />ALL OVER INDIA AND WORLD. 
<br /><br />Arise, Awake and Stop not till we achieve Peace. It will be symbolizing our action if Lavanam can be a part in our team of leaders. If Lavanam…meaning Salt Satyagraha was for liberation and freedom of India, ours shall be “Asli” Salwa Jhudum…Peace March from the confluence of Sabari, Sileru and Godavari rivers. 
<br />We appreciate the commitment to the cause and the courage of hard core terrorists willing to be killed, while killing others. But, we believe it needs greater courage to be willing to be killed while no intention to kill others … the courage shown by Dhandi marchers showing their chest to bullets. 
<br />We need minimum One Hundred and hundreds more keep joining our march to Abhujiyamad. If we are hundred, we can start and I will be one of them. I and our organisations will provide base camp and our communities’ frugal hospitality.

<br />RENEWED  H&amp;MR MOBILISATION
<br />Dear Friends in Solidarity,                ,                                       3rd November 2009
<br />Jai Insaan, Jai Hind and Jai Jagath.
<br /><br />I need a hard core of 100 E-friends to be Karmayogis and Satyagrahis in my People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission. A Karmayogi in my opinion is one who is willing to give reasonable contribution in terms of body, mind and material resources to the needy neighbours in this global Humanistic Society- Vasudaika Kutumbam. 
<br />They shall from among them and all others mobilize…
<br />1.	Minimum Rs.25, 000.00 from among themselves and more from others.
<br />2.	Volunteers to give time from their sweet home.
<br />3.	As many Volunteers to visit the Eastern Ghats and Dandakaranya for days, weeks, months and as long as they desire and can afford “at no cost’ in the field. 
<br />I am sixty and on an unbeaten path both in my personal and professional life – both of which are the same to me, since 1973. I started as a Volunteer at Hyderabad in student life in 1966 and exhorted by Baba Amte, plunged as a one person army on the 15th August 1973 to set my journey to live with tribal communities in the Eastern Ghats with initial base at Bhadrachalam town village.
<br />In 1975, I shifted my base right in more interior Chatti village of Chintur Village of Khammam District on the banks of river Sabari, a tributary to River Godavari. This village is located just around less than five Kilometers from Orissa and Chattishgarh. All these years, I was an absolute volunteer depending upon friends and the tribal communities for my livelihood and I had a team of tribal youth as colleagues.
<br />In 1977, we formed the first formal Organisation called Girijana Seema Welfare Association – GSWA and started getting foreign funds. Over the years, I realized that we Voluntary Organisation got converted into NGOs and not only lost the spiritual value but many in the sector have become fraud and corrupt. To my pride and cooperation of my colleagues, on honesty part, we remained corruption and fraud free. But, we lost the voluntary instincts as a team and started depending upon the foreign funds, instead of the communities. We literally became employer and employees. 
<br />Over the years, beside GSWA, a vibrant initiative called Chaitanya Shravanthi –CS was formed by my late wife Smt.V.B.Mani in 1983. 
<br />I realized the great stress and fatigue in the last years from 2004.
<br />I have now declared my self as a one person Mission called People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission, since November 2008. 
<br />•	I do wish to influence the entire lot of convert NGOs, beginning with GSWA and CS to become true Voluntary Organisation or Community Based Voluntary Organisation, retaining the spiritual content of Humanism. 
<br />•	A system of Internal Accounting and Audit made collectively towards self accreditation. We need corruption and fraud free Voluntary Sector.
<br />•	Gurukulams to enable Adivasi Children learn and except few exceptions work towards the enrichment of their area and community.
<br />•	Eastern Ghats and Dandakaranya are declared Peace Zones for all.
<br />With the now looming War declared by our Indian State upon our own Citizens to flush out and arrest or kill the Maoists, we are afraid that thousands civilians will be killed and hundreds of women raped…Ah La Srilankan operation against LTTE. It is a maddening nightmare to even think that this could be soon happening.
<br />WE SHOULD LEARN FROM MANY OTHERS ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE, GET INVOLVED AND INVOLVE THEM IN BRINGING A LASTING SOLUTION.
<br />I am “crazy…lazy…difficult” to handle, unable to write professionally, I pour emotion etc. I need Help even to effectively communicate.
<br />With High Regards,,

<br />Dear Friends in Solidarity,                                                      16th November 2009
<br />WE are not inviting everyone to physically participate in this initiative. We need the Solidarity of every one to take forward the initiative as a mission and movement towards achieving the Second Freedom and Independence visualized by Mahatma Gandhi. We need to draw inspiration from Rabindranath Tagore to empower the People, initially the Adivasis in Dandakaranya to be free of the shackles of the Government.  
<br />At a small preliminary conclave with the local community at Chinthur on the 14th Nov 09 …it was strongly felt that initial appeal should not have attachments and this re-appeal is now made without attachments.  
<br />•	Further, we have again resolved to seek your mandate even to start the initiative- 75% of “yes” votes from those responding to this appeal, since this grass root initiative needs wider appreciation, participation at different levels and support.
<br />•	Both to inaugurate and plan Manya Prantha Shanti Yatra but also symbolically provide community based shelter and learning opportunities to 50 Children who are driven out of their lands from Chhattisgarh, at Chatti campus of ours from 1st December 2009 to 5th December 2009. 
<br />•	Those of you having time and itch are welcome to join us for five days or even couple of hours during the period, which will include five volunteers undertaking solemn fast for three days from the 2nd and observe silence- Moun Vrat on the 4th December 2009.
<br />Context and need!
<br />1.	Innocent Karma yogis in Police, paramilitary and military forces are victims of continuing Maoists violence in Dandakaranya. Nobody is against the liberation of oppressed Adivasis in Dandakaranya, but Maoists must change their strategy to peaceful and democratic means. Mao did not mean only GUNS.
<br />2.	Green Hunt started by the Government is like rubbing the salt on the deep hurt. In terms of number, the number of Adivasis forced to leave Chhattisgarh to Andhra Pradesh; it exceeds the refugees who came to India from Burma and Pakistan. Ironically, these are called Internally Displaced Persons and but getting worse treatment in their own country- The Tahsildars, the Sub Collectors and District collectors have taken the role of legislature and judiciary to interpret even the Central Government Act- NREGA by depriving these Indian Adivasis Citizens of their constitutional Right to get employment under this act. The Judiciary is blind and needs activists to engage advocates in Public Interest Litigation. 
<br />3.	Activists, Volunteers in Voluntary Organisations and humane funding agencies are responding their best to not only meet the immediate situation by providing frugal succor but also mobilizing the public opinion/ drawing the attention of the Government to act in Solidarity with Adivasis. 
<br />4.	But, a time has come to invoke the weapon of AHIMSA and Satyagraha, hundreds satyagrahis with guts and wits of Gandhi, to come forward. 
<br />5.	It is time for all Participatory Development practitioners to test the spirit of Panchayath Raj act and establish the need for Adivasis to have first and final control over their resources. They must shift to Participatory Democracy, since as such India has enough resources for Development.
<br />6.	Maoists must join this Democratic path to reach their goal of liberation of Dandakaranya without any deviation, except giving up their guns. To facilitate this to happen, Government must give space and also commit to implement the Panchayath Raj Act not only in letters but to the gut spirit of the Act and inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s Dream of Gram Swaraj- Gandhi did not mean only Spinning Wheel. 
<br />We need your Solidarity and services as Volunteers from where you are and what you are doing. 
<br />We need few of you to volunteer as spokesperson to plough through tons of information and emotional outbursts from the Adivasis and grass root workers, edit to different levels as marketable means of communication and disseminate the message and developments. We need someone to translate and disseminate in Telugu and Hindi languages, so that Aam Aadhmi at the grass root can be better informed. This is a specific request.
<br />Please feel free to ask for any specific details and logistics, just in case you are interested to join us for a couple of days.

<br />MY MISSION TODAY AND EXPECTATIONS FROM OTHERS
<br /><br />JAI INSAAN, JAI HIND AND JAI JAGATH.
<br /><br />I have something of pride in common with our beloved Ex-President Mr. Abdul Kallam.  We both were newspaper boys in our youth. 
<br /><br />My immediate motivation
<br />My immediate motivation to plunge was Late Baba Amte and Late Yadunath Thatte. Baba Amte is a well known Social Worker and founder of Maharogi Seva Samithi in Maharashtra. Yadunath Thatte was the Secretary of Antar Bharati founded by Late Sri.Saneguruji, Freedom fighter and Social worker. I attended All India Shram Sanskar Chaoni- at Somnath (A symbolic village constructed by leprosy patients under the guidance of Baba Amte in Chandrapur District of Maharashtra) in 1967 and 1968. It was here during these camps few of us from all over India committed ourselves to work with oppressed and downtrodden communities. 
<br />Earlier, since 1966 I was instrumental in a Hyderabad based Youth Organisation called Peace and Prosperity Club- P and P Club, which got the focus upon Humanism by reading about some news-items on Friends of Humanity initiative of Bertrand Russell. 
<br />Yes, by nativity I belong to Tamil Nadu. After my primary education in Tamil Nadu and middle school in Bangalore- Karnataka, I moved to Hyderabad in 1961 with the transfer and final settlement of my father working in Military, at Hyderabad. 
<br />Though I decided to plunge, I was innocent, needed added guts to plunge and it took some time, until I decided to get my freedom symbolically on the 15th August 1973 to ‘drop out’ and start to live with the  Tribal communities in Khammam District around Bhadrachalam temple town.
<br />Sri. Kumar Shiralkar, my friend in Somnath first camp was a staunch Marxist and I basically a Gandhian. After the camp, he joined the initiative Shramikh Sanghatana- Solidarity of workers, based at Shahada Taluq in Dhulia district of Maharashtra, with tribal communities. We had a series of letters exchanged and to my utter surprise that I could not believe was that the Tribals in the area could not get their legal entitlements on land through courts. With my strong Gandhian belief and that courts will give justice, I wanted to verify the facts and that made me to choose to work with tribal communities.
<br />In the meantime, call it fantasy or genuine urge; I wanted to initiate what I called as An Agricultural Tribal Township- A commune for educated ‘developed urban youth’ like me and the local tribal youth. I was very much influenced by …
<br />•	Kibbutz communes of Israel
<br />•	An article in The Hindu daily exhorted to take the towns to the villages and solve the issue of urbanization
<br />•	The concept behind certain movies like Maro Prapancham- (an ideal another world), Kuzhaindakal Kanda Kutiarasu- (Democracy Founded by Children)
<br />•	And of course Somnath where the otherwise outcaste leprosy patients could live in dignity by constructive activities
<br />I was sitting in Kumar Printing Press near Ranigunj in Secunderabad, editing my favourite magazine and my nick name called NUT…s of P and P Club, sometime in 1973 first few months. As I was scanning through the newspaper, to my pleasant surprise a news item released by Mr. Kamala Manohar Rao- Director of Tribal Welfare struck me? It was all about the heaven shown to the tribal communities by the Government. Immediately, I called him on the telephone and met him on his invitation. He arranged for my surveillance visit to the neighbouring Warangal District, where tribals live. It was a lavish government sponsored visit in Petrol jeep and I had the first thrill of meeting a naxalite at the border village of Ailapur. Interestingly, he was one of my school mates and it was thrilling, pleasing and useful.
<br />Sri. K. Madhava Rao, the District Collector of Warangal was very kind to survey and assure me that he would allot 300 acres of land at Kanthanapalli Village in Mulug. In my usual style, I fixed the Muhurtham- the auspicious day of 15th August 1973 to take over the possession of land and start my dream project.
<br />To my pride, though I was with my parents and they as anyone else were taking care of me, I was already engaged as a newspaper boy, bread boy selling the first ever machine made bread in India from Modern Bakeries of Government of India and also the first time bottled milk that entered in the market since 1967-68. I made enough profits to have good pocket money, fund P and P Club and also contribute to my parents. Eventually, I got a job as teacher in my own school where I studied my high school- Mahbub College Higher Secondary school as a teacher. Sri.J. Veeraswamy, who is no more, was the Principal of the school when I was the student and thrillingly when I became the teacher, also. His tearful send off, when I submitted my resignation that he did not accept and said that I will never change and should I have set backs to come back, he will give the job back to me. 
<br />I think,  it was around 10th August 1973, I resigned that I got a telegram from Madhava Rao suggesting that I postpone my departure, since the proposed land is under dispute that he cannot handover to me/us. 
<br />But, as usual my character, I was determined and started on the 15th August 1973, but changed my destination to Khammam District. From then, it was my actual delearning and relearning my tribal Fourth World. 
<br />Till then, I was not conversant in Telugu and people over at Bhadrachalam know only Telugu and in the villages Telugu with local Koya Tribal Dialect. To be truthful, knowing only to eat rice and chapattis (Indian bread), I was not competent to develop tribal communities growing crops and that too better. I had no agenda with the tribal communities that I can communicate or demonstrate. I spent my time at Bhadrachalam town. I spent initially more of my time with socially oriented Dr.A.P.Ranga Rao, Dr.Radhakrishna and Sub Collectors/ Divisional Forest officers like J.Harinarayan, Jainder Singh, J.V.Sharma and others- repeating my urban P and P Club activities at Bhadrachalam Junior College. 
<br />I initiated a failed cooperative called Girijana Seema Labour Contract Cooperative Society, getting a grant of Rs.10, 000.00 and loan of another Rs.10, 000.00 from Integrated Tribal Development Agency- ITDA of the Government. I could still manage to get a loan on gold platter from State Bank of Hyderabad, Bhadrachalam Branch to the tune of over Rs.5.00 Lakhs to rejuvenate the society under an innovative banking scheme. But, the District Collector P.V.R.K. Prasad surrendered and firmly said that he has no control over the Forest and Medical Departments, though he is supposed to be the agent of the Government and has constitutional provision of directly approaching even the Governor directly even bypassing the legislature that no one had the guts to do. 
<br />Disheartened for the first time in my life, I (temporarily) surrendered to the fate and returned to Hyderabad. But, myself esteem did not let me go to my parents in distress. I got to Oasis school, Mehdipatnam, Hyderabad without any condition to stay and spend time with children.- I was always critical at the founder Sri.B.L.Narayana that he is putting all his good efforts to the rich children from the rural areas. He in his usual benevolent laugh used to say that Children have no class discrimination.
<br />The climax was my utter failure to raise resources for the school from the very multi millionaires’ parent of the Children and I bounced back to Bhadrachalam…then to Chinthur area, where I had earlier ventured the aborted Girijana Seema Labour Contract Cooperative Society. Chinthur is around 70 kilometers away from Bhadrachalam town, 130 kilometers from Khammam District Head Quarters and 400 Kilometers from the State capital Hyderabad by road. It was interior village bordering then Madhya Pradesh (now Chhattisgarh) and Orissa States with no rail or air links.
<br />I had no agenda and I found one with the communities, Education. 
<br />All these years, I was two hundred percent a Volunteer raising my resources from friends and community. 
<br />I got the first Project and Foreign Funds from middle of 1977, forming the first initiative Girijana Seema Welfare Association- GSWA. From then, it was a mad run with project and funds up to 2008. Chaitanya Shravanthi- CS and Girijana Prajala Sangam- GPS were directly initiated by me and almost all the organisations in these areas have staff that worked with me as their founders or got our all-round support. In other words, we were the first initiatives in the area around Chinthur in Khammam District and entire Visakha Tribal Area around Gudem village. 
<br />Over the years, we have reached the unreached and taken up activities that none or Government could take up. Our main thrust was Education, Irrigation and Thrift. We must have mobilised around Rs.50 millions as inputs from both foreign and Indian Funding agencies. We were happy, really helped the communities and rich all these years.
<br />But, since 2002 and from 2004 it was strongly felt. The team lost sensitivity in Volunteerism. It was the case in the entire Voluntary Sector that got converted as Non Government Organisations- NGOs. The tribal communities totally corrupted, became dependent on freebees and youth opting to abdicate their lands to move to green urban pastures, if they get a job. Others were willing to wile away their time but not willing to work or develop their own area.
<br />I got little frustrated but with usual perpetual optimism got out of all legal responsibilities of GSWA and CS Voluntary Organisations. 
<br />I started my journey-1973 again. I am today a true volunteer, with strain vestiges of funded Voluntary Organisations/ NGOs that I got temporarily baptized in my life tenure.
<br /><br />PEOPLE’s PEACE and PROSPERITY MISSION- the linking thread of Humanism, Peace and Prosperity.
<br />I was recently asked a question by a friend of mine that I am talking of too many things and what is that exactly I am doing and accomplished, since 2008.? 
<br />People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission is a self styled idea, as many of you are invited as friends and team members to take forward the action. From my side, I deem all to be friends and team members, while making my best efforts to involve as many actively and proactively at different levels.
<br />We in the team of People’s Peace and Prosperity Mission- PPPM believe in Ahimsa, Justice and Local Governance and means to achieve this as Democracy. The key foundation of democracy is to respect even a lone dissent, listen peacefully and completely their views with appreciation even without agreement. 
<br />I will prepare a concept note on each of the agenda which dynamically will get updated by different mutual influences and report the specific progress periodically..through emails and hopefully the proposed new yahoogroup I am learing.
<br />Agenda… A Dream.
<br />1.	Rejuvenating and Promoting Volunteerism- campaign and facilitation.
<br />2.	Democratization of Voluntary Organisations and their improved Governance. Initiate with my own past initiatives of Girijana Seema Welfare Association- GSWA and Chaitanya Shravanthi- CS.
<br />VO to NGO meaning VO which are non state in Character, A Platonic Stateless Society with State, A State without Army or Police with Weapons.- to converge as a Global Organisation.
<br />3.	Student and Youth involvement in the Community Development. The core instrument is initiation of institution based on the core values that existed in the traditional Gurukulam. Start one each at Gudem in Visakha and Chatti in Khammam District- in two tracks. 
<br />4.	Global AHIMSA, JUSTICE AND SELF RULE- Campaign.
<br />5.	Explore solutions following the path of Ahimsa, Justice and Self Rule/Governance in response to the prevailing violence in Dandakaranya and resulting Human Misery and alienation of Adivasi Indian Citizens- Campaign and collective plural but mutually influencing activities.
<br />6.	Spread the opinion for a need to form new states, reorganize the States and even settle nagging border issues in India- once for all decisively, so that the present ongoing violent and hatred experience of Andhra Pradesh will not repeat. 
<br />Telangana is established through Ahimsa. Speak out persuasively on the need to follow Ahimsa path in achieving Telangana.
<br />Learn from Andhra Pradesh not to leave things to the hands of Politicians but a need to actively involve the Citizens in the process.
<br />Explore ways and means to bring Peace and Love among all the Telugu people and People of Andhra Pradesh, whatever may be outcome in the present tangle.
<br />Campaign, talk and influence single candles.
<br />7.	I want to write my experiences and ideas.
<br />8.	I want to write my life.
<br />9.	I want to improve my reading.
<br />10.	Manage one yahoogroup or similar group for PPPM.
<br />11.	Manage a web site for PPPM including one with Karmayog…the great initiative.

<br />PEOPLE’s PEACE AND PROSPERITY MISSION is an outcome of over 30 years of actively working as a Social Worker and deemed Volunteer in the Development field among Adivasi Communities in the Dandakaranya, the Eastern Ghats. 
<br />1.	It is self styled and will remain as an informal team.
<br />2.	OBJECTIVES
<br />Ahimsa, Justice and Freedom and Independence of People, which is only possible through Local Self Governance and Participatory Democracy, is our objective.
<br />We act within our limitation to achieve this Globally, at National level and focused upon Dandakaranya, the Eastern Ghats. 
<br />3.	MEMBERSHIP IN THE TEAM
<br />•	All the Global Citizens are deemed members in the mission.
<br />•	Those who show interest to read our information and once in a way respond are called active members--- We have their contact details.
<br />•	Those who are proactive and willing to proactively participate within their limitations are called Proactive Members--- we have their contact details. They attend our activities and meetings more often.
<br />•	Core Members are those who give committed and keep the mission on move- myself and you are the first two core members.
<br />4.	VOLUNTEERISM AND PROFESSIONALISM
<br />We believe in professionalism. To us, professionalism is to do any activity taken up effectively and efficiently.
<br />Volunteerism is both a contribution towards welfare of the people and struggle towards reaching a society with Ahimsa, Justice and Independent- which is possible only through Local Self Governance and Participatory Democracy
<br />We do not reach success, we tread on the path of success moving towards ever evading Ultimate Truth.
<br />5.	POLICY ON RESOURCES:
<br />We start working with what we have and mobilise resources, because we feel it needs to be done. We do not wait to mobilise resources and start our activities.
<br />•	As a mission we will not apply for projects, get funds and manage activities.
<br />•	We work through Volunteers’ team/s at different level.
<br />•	We get individual contributions or teams mobilizing such resources for us.
<br />•	We welcome institutions and organisations to give us gifts in kind and material. 
<br />•	Similarly, Institutions and Organisations are welcome to participate in our activities which they may mobilise through projects.
<br />•	We believe in what Baba Amte told along with what Gandhi said regarding funds and accounts.
<br />“Do not insult a Volunteer by asking them accounts…but a Volunteer shall maintain accounts on day to day basis and keep it open for all to see.”
