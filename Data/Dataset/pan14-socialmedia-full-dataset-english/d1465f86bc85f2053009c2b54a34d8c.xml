<br />my entire journal just got deleted some how and i dont have time to write it all again right now. haha.
<br /><br />stand by me is the best movie ever.
<br />basically this should say welcome to hell. i always stand up for myself when people make me feel bad for no reason.  i didnt but it was a perfect learning lesson. kinda need that put things into perspective. none of the little things matter nothing matters except if you content with going to sleep with who you are at night..that wont ever change and i cant imagine how some people are able to do that.
<br /><br />i want these really bad.
<br /><br />retrograde is almost over time to start life again.
<br /><br />morgan fell out of a moving cab and i fell asleep in the bathtub and flooded it.
<br /><br />people are cellophane and if they think there filling a void its just really sad and pathetic. i have nothing to prove to anyone and other people do.. i would rather not be associated with negativity.. the whole time i felt it but was bored so ignored it .. thats best way i can think to describe it. im on a different level i dont need false things to make me feel better about myself. maybe one day you wont be so alone and youll figure life out but as for now whatever helps you pass the time i asume. 
<br /><br />i should clean and unpack but i need to see nodar so it might have to wait merch i getting printed next week! and me and jessica are meeting up .. you will be pleased.
<br /><br />how was everyones valentines day i hate that holiday but tell me what you did!
<br /><br />hahaha i foudn this online its pretty dramatic and funny.

<br /><br />I believe, that certain people in life are meant to fall by the wayside, to serve as warnings to the rest of us, signs posts along the way.
<br /><br />im not quite sure where to start my life is so surreal no one will believe me anyway. 
<br />retograde ruined my life in new york it made me crazy i would like to say im just making up an excuse because im out of my mind but i really think that stuff can affect people on higher levels.
<br /><br />the whole time in nyc we filmed true life im at fashion week for mtv did rehersals, went to bryant park for fashion shows.
<br />we had this obsession with eating cake 2 times a day while we were in nyc because we were there for fashion week and it seemed funny and glamerous... until i got home and came to mind that my ass got bigger then it already was... and i have a big ass ahhah. pissed. detox from nyc cake ass is in full effect!
<br /><br />i met so many fun people in nyc it was stressful at time but i had a great time me and hanna slept togeather in a closet.. haha hum. all we do is crank call people and then they end up wanting to be our friends again it will never get old.
<br /><br />so we did a shoot for richy rich from heathertte... nothing else could of been that awsome for me hes is my fashion icon since day one. i use to be in the club kid scene when i was 17 haha will never get over it. there genious. 
<br /><br />im glad to be back i needed a break for a day or two. we fly to vegas at 6am for magic.. never been to it kinda stoked.
<br />im hosting a party there if your 21 come get drunkard with me!
<br /><br />dj frankie and me are going to urth cafe im having a daily mental breakdown about nothing and seeking his advice hahaha. im so stoked that across universe is out on dvd! it hasnt left my dvd player since. factory girl and igby goes down are on breakmode. and i got pink flamingos need i say more?
<br /><br />one of my close friends i grew up with since i was 5 till in 11th grade passed away yesterday. its so wierd i dont know how to react i havent seen her in a long time but we spent so many years togeather. i wish i was in philly so i could go to the viewing it still hasnt hit me yet. death is so surreal. i dont think anyone really ever dies there still here just in another form its not like youll never see them again.. there on a permanent holiday living it up and well get to go drink not be stressed out and lay on beach with them eventually in another dimension.
<br /><br />how do you guys feel about vegas should i gambel or no? im a very compolsive addiction person. i monitor my life so much because if i want something. im going to get it .. that is a very bad way to live. atleast im smart enough to stay away from things and people wich will kill me in the end. so gambeling would probably be one of the 3 worst ideas i could do.. BUT i have 100$ free to one of the casinos.. meow.
<br /><br />i guess im not asexual anymore because im obsessed with a boy and its not a tranny whos poster i want to hang over my bed. 
<br /><br />this months alterative press
<br /><br />the sign morgan and scrappy had for us at the airport
<br /><br />i need a photo of my living room after my lantern fest of depression but they make me hapy so i guess it worked.

<br />Last night me and Alyx went to the Kooks show across the street from her store. It was really rad. The drinks were so cheap and it was in a really tiny room. Later we stopped by CoCo Deville to see Frankie. I have to fly to Utah in a few hours and haven't packed yet. Procrastination. I hate Flying!

I never understood the kids who love a band and soon as the band get successful ..they automatically suck and are sell outs. I dont have time to sit home everyday and write entrys about drama, restaurants i eat at everyday and movies i sit around home watching. I apologize if thats the fun stuff you enjoy to read. If you think i was more interesting when my days consisted of being angry teenager, poor and having no career.. well im sorry that says more about your character then mine. Im 22 years old im not 18 anymore and i work alot towards something i enjoy and im happy. 
<br />There are plenty of kids who blog about doing nothing and there daily drama so do us all a favor and direct your negativity over there. Your either going to love me or hate me and im not here to try and convince you to do either. To the amazing fans who support me i appreciate every single one of you.. to the kids who spend too much time reading internet gossip and hate everything about me find something you like to focuses all your energy on, you'll be alot happier.

<br />I woke up on the beach in Malibu today and i think this is something everyone should do at the least once in there life. I wasn't so thrilled when i had to be home by a respectable hour this morning and turn my phone back on. My nails as of now are Blue spotted cow print. They have these new nail decals in Los Angeles that are shrinkie dink stickers,I got them done at the Extremities Spa. I feel like its wrapping paper for your nails!
<br /><br />Tomorrow my Editorial shoot might be at salvation mountain..im crossing my appendages! These photos are from backstage at fashion week New York City.

<br />I will never be ignored. I use to love Garbage, Shirley Manson is a bad ass chick! I stole these images from NYC Village Voice. The makeup for Fashion Week was very circus dolly.. i felt like a deranged glamorous clown. Today is the Emmy's gifting suit and i cant decide if i want to go.. or stay home relax and finish my Barbie house!
<br /><br />Its better to be hated for who you, are then loved for what your not! I was given the cutest Minny Mouse shirt last night that fits as the perfect dress!
<br /><br />Quivers down the backbone.
