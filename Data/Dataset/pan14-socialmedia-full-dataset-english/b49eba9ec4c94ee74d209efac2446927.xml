Some classes can even be taken online, all for a reasonable rate. These classes will get you a certificate that you can use to obtain an entry level position in the air industry.<br /><br />Since 9/11, cabin crews have became even more skilled in airline safety then ever before. They study extensively about hijacking and how to properly handle those situations. Airline safety training is mandated by the FAA. Self-defense training, while not required, is offered to every cabin crew member free of charge if they choose to accept this training. Sadly, however, because flight attendants must take this training on a non paid day off, few have taken the opportunity.<br /><br />Flights with 20 or more passengers require a Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency to let the airline company know you have met the requirements needed to handle any situation you might encounter in the air.<br /><br />If you are still interested in this industry there is still one more thing to consider. Airlines generally have height and weight requirements. These are usually because of the tight quarters of an aircraft. Air lines want their flight attendants to be tall enough to reach the overhead cabins and not to large as to have trouble passing through the isles doing passenger checks.<br /><br />If cabin crew training sounds like it is right for you then you should begin your search by applying through some airlines. Most companies in the air industry have localized training. Alternatively, you can choose online classes, but in class is recommended for the purpose of hands on study.<br /><br />A cabin crew interview is an interesting process that is a little unique. You can walk into an open call session that will interview numerous candidates during the day. You can also schedule an interview if you are invited to do so. Either way, the interview process is really nerve wracking for some people. You can expect different types of interviews depending on the airline.<br /><br />A briefing may very well be given. During this briefing you will be given details that are considered important to the airline that will be followed up by an exam of sorts. Written examinations are common in the industry, but a written exam is not the end of your interview. The panel will want to meet you.<br /><br />Your cabin crew interview will often involve selling yourself, starting with focusing hard on your strengths and your ability to deal with high stress situations. If you tend to get flustered easily you might find this job a little too taxing.<br /><br />The panel may very well ask you questions that are intended to frustrate you. For instance, they may ask you very similar questions repeatedly and then ask for additional details. The point is to make you repeat the answer without getting frustrated and hopefully, you will even find different ways to say the same thing.<br /><br />Representatives of any airline is going to come across well mannered, well groomed, and with the infinite ability to deliver customer service at the top of the class level. Displaying qualities during the interview that are demonstrative of a high level customer service representative is just the beginning.

Although customer service is a secondary function, this is primarily what sells the airline operator to passengers.<br /><br />Customer service commences when passengers board the aircraft with their boarding passes, are welcomed on board and are assisted with their seat locations and stowing of their hand luggage. Duties include serving of food and beverages, offering of items such as headsets, menus, duty free items, magazines and many other items in a friendly, warm and confident manner. You will also be expected to assist and brief Special Needs Passengers such as minors travelling on their own, visually impaired passengers and persons with reduced mobility. When serving in business class, you may be required to prepare lie flat beds with blankets and pillows and to describe seat functionality. Parents travelling with infants or children will be briefed on what the airline offers to make their flight more comfortable. Customer service ends when the last passenger has disembarked from the aircraft.<br /><br />If you are reading this then there is a good chance that you are thinking of applying for a Cabin Crew/Flight Attendant position. Or perhaps you have already applied to airlines but as yet have had no success. Either way you will undoubtedly be longing to attain this all too often elusive career.<br /><br />The world of Cabin Crew is without doubt, unique. Very few careers offer such a diverse and erratic lifestyle.<br /><br />How many jobs can you think of where you, as an employee, can go to work at 5am and not know literally where in the world you might be by midday? This is a regular occurrence for hundreds of thousands of crew around the globe.<br /><br />Although you will always be rostered each month for a set amount of flights with predetermined destinations, you will however find yourself with many Standby shifts. These can either be home standbys or airport standbys.<br /><br />By standby I mean that you have to be prepared to depart for any corner of the globe at a moment's notice. On an airport standby you will probably have less than 15 minutes to get to the briefing room and a maximum of 90 minutes on a home standby.<br /><br />Of course you will need to have bags packed to cater for all climates and for a stay of up to 4 or 5 days down route. This is something that can be tricky to master and indeed takes time to refine.<br /><br />Crew life can be very taxing, not only physically and emotionally but also on personal relationships. Your partner could be saying goodbye, as he or she leaves for work at 8am on a Thursday morning, and be coming home that evening to discover that they won't see you again until the following Monday.<br /><br />Your social life outside of the airline can be almost non existent and the partners of Crew often find themselves going to parties and other functions alone. You really have to have a solid based relationship if you want to keep this career and a love interest going side by side.<br /><br />Fifteen years or so ago, the lifestyle, salary and perks that came with a career of flying made up for much of the disruption to normal life.
