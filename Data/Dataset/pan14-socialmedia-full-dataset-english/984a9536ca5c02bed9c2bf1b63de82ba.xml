SaMe 2 my buddy &gt;&gt;&gt;<em>LING</em>. there4 ouR w0Rking tiMe wilb delay til 9pm to0[gud wat..wuNb so tiRed=p] I slp tiL 11.15am oli wakE up dRess up myselF. Waa~~ so0 syok man~~ Now my b0Dy was fully-aniMatED,w0Rk tiL wat time oso no prob lerh~ Perhaps due 2 diz reason,feeL like time pass to0 quickly 4 2day[at least not pass as usuaL&gt;.&lt;!] Evening,my pretty boss came visit us^^[/customers??] While me &amp; her having a sh0Rt chit-chat time,ouR manageR,huu sitting not fAR fRm ouR standing poiNt,wink his eyes,ask us 2 attend a short briefing thErE. So do <em>LING</em>. D tablE jz eNuf 2 fit in 4 ppl &gt;&gt;&gt; Me,<em>LING</em>,pretty boss &amp; manageR. I sit infr0Nt my manager,<em>LING</em> sit bside him while my coach sit jz bside me. [It seems like a battle array&gt;.&lt;!] I wonder... ... ... ManageR stARt his briefing As so0n As v sit down &amp; asking our view/complaiNt relatED 2 d prob. [heyx,ManageR luv 2 do tat??] . d prob seems much detrimental 2 <em>LING</em>. My coach was d 1st voice out her view[heyx she is a stRaight4ward person. I damn admire her nature!]. She seems quitE xcite on her talk...I did pay attENtion on her at 1st but not 4 d middlE &amp; end part[cz i m bc serving customer&gt;.&lt;!] Aiks...wish 2 replay bck. Huh. <em>LING</em> seems abit dissatisfy wif her talk[cz it is unfavourable 2 her]. Den. My turn. without any hessitation,I voice out my opinion[which is quite partial 2 my coach's opinion=p] D situation was gEtting much eMbarassed. Argument frM us like poiNted at <em>LING</em>. sumore our sitting poiNt. shown clearly. [heyx,i dun wish tat k]. <em>LING</em> finally voice out her poiNt. against ME. huh,m i wrong??? I jz said as wat i tiNk oli worh&gt;.&lt;! Not purposely stand at huu's side 0s0.. Jz similar tiNking oli~ My coach's argument was right . 4 ME. At least tat is wat i tiNk!!! After <em>LING</em> finish her talk,ouR briefing closed. [I oso 4got how was d conclusion]. V continue ouR duty. I found <em>LING</em>. wish 2 get more her opinion. She is talking 2 another head[of us]. I walk 2 her. they immediately stop discussing. Again,situation was getting eMbarrased. I pull out d topic agaiN 2 clear out my mind. But so0N i regret wif my action... If based on wat <em>LING</em> said.. I m d source of d prob[OMG]. BUt. I can't get any confirMation 4 tat! my coach leave ady..she is d ONLY 1 huu can prove it.  When i wish 2 voice further,d Ahead ask me 2 serve customer. I din haf chance 2 fight 4 my right at all. Both of them continue thEir  disscussion. Me...serving customers lorh[wat else can i do???] Without payiNg any attENtion. I nid 2 fiNd an ans 4 all these thingz! y tiMe pass so slow ady?? i wan bck hoMe lehh..keep on staying heRe feeling bad..i dun wish faciNg them anymore. not even a second. tat wil jz increase my qustion marks.. Plz.... Mummy.. where r u... ... ... ... ... ... AHAH! here u r!! I quickly get in2 my car after punch card. Can't slp. Jz kept tinking ouR briefing jz nw... wat <em>LING</em> said... how they treat me... izit my fault? izit? Arhhh~ its annoying kerh.. 11.30pm.laid on my bed. eyes open. tinking... many.... question marks....... y they r differ saying 1?? i nid ans.... huu can ans me?? my coach... how?? sms...cal...

<br />Ardy 2days working ONLY 2 waitress. NoNoNo. shudb say only 1 waitress[ME],1 cashier[<em>LING</em>] 2 ppl open shop,damn tiRed man! 2day <em>LING</em> is bck. Her mood seems greatly affected by d briefing tat day. [heyx,she works 4low her mood 1 o.moral value: if she bad mood,means i kesian luuXD]  2day she spend moz of d tiMe inside cashier.. doing her tingz[due 2 her bad mood? I wonder..] ME?? duty,serving customer lorh[outside her cashier la of cz]  My pretty boss??? she MC 2-dayz ardy.. duno when she wil cum bck join our working team oso... miss her so much erhhh~~~~~
<br /><br />Dinner time. white rice,chicken,vegetables. evryday oso d same. ishhh~ evryday oso got chicken 1... jz d way they co0k d chicken differ oli... taste differ lorh... but stil d same. chicken..chickEN....&amp; CHICKEN. yiarkx~ [1 day in d future,ALL st 1 stuff wil turned in2 chicken 1....u say i say larh=p] Having 'Chicken Dinner' wif <em>LING</em>.. ONLY.. V both,sitting infront each other,without any communication...so0 lame=.='  Itz to0 quiet. to0 abnormal. even d sound of heart beats oso can hear=.='   Finaly,I start up d conversation. talking smth nonsense... [better than no rite=.=']   Den. duno y. v came bck 2 tat briefing topic again....
<br /><br />Huh. smth is goin wrong. Our conversation starts involved plenty of ppl... no longer individual. Jz seems like having a HUGE meeting. Each of them voice out their discontented fact[which i tink they r greatly resentful wif it] matter fact,they r gossiping around. sumore their dissatisfaction r all pointed 2 my luvly coach. D conversation is suckx! I rather wish tat I never start up d nonsense conversation...which wil ended up like diz. huu knows? [reli out of my xpectation]. 
<br /><br />they seems purposely told me all of diz... ALL d bad tingz of her... y?? wat is thier purpose doing like tat? Do they nid 2b so cruel?? In fact,they knew she having a gud image in my heart[jz like wat <em>LING</em> said]
<br />she is right. so wat 4 stil keep on telling me these nonsense... wat 4?!? r they gossipmonger? or only 1 of them was? jz d rest being infected..now my turn oli.....I rather chose 2 blif d laz conjecture.
<br /><br /><strong><em>''V enter d conversation is cz of u.V wana let u noe....d true face of ur bluv coach......Now all stuff is cleared wif these....jz left u,an innocent galz....being played around..........'' </em></strong> rmbr. I still rmbr. Fresh in my mind. It jz sounds like all 1 gang works on pulling me 2 join them[at least diz is how i tink on tat time]. Bullshitz~  All of d poiNts they said were jz straight 2 her. Their words wil jz generates hate. When i hate,den i'll bound 2 get irate. Madness is wat i demonstrate. I argue wif them 4 some poiNts. stand straight on my poiNts to0! [though jz standing alone] tAtx xcactly how my anger works &amp; operates^^ diz wil set me str8!!! BUt. seems like they ady planing well strive 2 win diz WAR.. they'd made big effort.
<br /><br />Is to0 much argument. I stop quarrel wif them ardy. Jz heard wat they said... wat they wana let me noe.. wana let me hear... I ady tired. tired of getting all these nonsense. Nonsense of nonsense. 
<br /><br />R diz all a fact?? i dun wish.
<br />Around 8 of them pointed d same tingz..
<br />stilL not a fact?? i reli dun wish..
<br />shudn't i trust them?? duno...
<br />Is annoying k.
<br />aiks~
<br />now..wat i goin 2 do...
<br />when she cum bck...
<br />facing her..
<br />no longer d coach i met b4..
<br />how wil i treat her...
<br />huu else can ans me..
<br />diz time definite not my respected coach anymoreT.T
<br /><br />SOng---&quot;Where is the Love&quot;  is playing...
<br />&quot;I can ask myself,
<br />realy wat is goin wrong?
<br />Wif diz world tat v livin in,
<br />people keep on givin in....
<br />making wrong decisions,
<br />only visions of them dividens.
<br />Not respecting each other,
<br />deny thy brother.
<br />A war is goin on...
<br />but d reason undercover.
<br />D truth is kept secret,
<br />&amp; swept under the rug.
<br />If u never kNow truth,
<br />then u never kNoe love.
<br />where's d love y'all? [T.T i dunno.....]
<br />where's d truth y'all? [T.T i dunno......]”
<br /><br />&quot;wateva happenned 2 d values of humanity?
<br />wateva happenned 2 d fairness &amp; equality?
<br />instead of spreading love'they' spreading animosity...
<br />lack of u'standing leading 'me' away frM unity...
<br />tats d reason y sometimes im feelin under,
<br />tats d reason y sometimes im feelin down...''
<br /><br />itx symbolises how im feelin now.....
<br />itx symbolises how im tinkin now.....
<br />so0....
<br />Fact??
<br />or wasn't a fact??
<br />I wonder...
<br />if its a fact.. &gt;&gt;&gt; my cute boss is fakE...NO. I dun wish.
<br />if it isn't.. &gt;&gt;&gt; all my buddy is fakE...No. Plz.. dun.....
<br />I gota trust huu now......

<br /><br />occupied only half the restaurant. The other half was
<br /><br />occupied by some American tourists. As the wedding
<br /><br />Chinese couples hop from table to table to toast the
<br /><br />guests, the cheers of ' KAN PEI .. ' (happy &amp; joyous
<br /><br />drinking) gets louder and louder.
<br /><br />One American gets more and more irritated as the
<br /><br />couple get closer to him.
<br /><br />' KAN PEI ..!' ' KAN .... PEI'....!!!' The cheers
<br /><br />continued.
<br /><br />Finally, the irritated American couldn't take it
<br /><br />anymore. He stood up on his chair and shouted.
<br /><br />'IF YOU CAN'T PAY, THEN LET ME PAY FOR YOU...!'
