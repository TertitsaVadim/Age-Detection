Every single has its good points and disadvantages - lead, as an example, is easy to bend but it requires skill to join, it's expensive and lead plumbing systems happen to be a contributory factor towards lead poisoning in soft water areas. Nowadays, most plumbing pipes are copper, though stainless-steel and rigid and flexible plastics are often utilised. Plastic pipe is becoming more frequent for the cold water service pipe in new houses.
<br /><br />Copper pipe
<br /><br />Copper pipe is in most cases easily available and fairly easy to work with. It comes in various sizes and is sized by its outside diameter - 15mm, 22mm and 28mm are essentially the most frequent sizes. Main runs and pipes feeding bath taps and also the hot water cylinder are quite often 22mm pipe. Pipes to all other taps are usually 15mm in diameter. The 28mm size could be utilized for some boiler pipes and often for feeding thehot water cylinder (instead of 22mm pipe).
<br /><br />Copper pipe can be cut using a fine-toothed <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVwbHVtYmluZ3Rvb2wuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L2hhY2tzYXctZnJhbWUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">hacksaw frame</a>  or using a special pipe ?cutting tool. Care will have to be taken when utilizing a hacksaw to cut the finish in the pipe exactly square, and the cut ought to be filed smooth both inside and out. A  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVwbHVtYmluZ3Rvb2wuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L3BpcGUtY3V0dGVycy5odG1s" target="_blank">pipe cutter</a>  tends to leave a burr around the inside with the pipe - this must be filed off or removed with the pointed reamer on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVwbHVtYmluZ3Rvb2wuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L2N1dHRpbmctdG9vbHMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Mini Bolt Cutters</a>.
<br /><br />Copper pipe can be bent relatively readily but it will have to be supported during the pro?cess or it'll kink. Smaller diameters can be bent by hand with all the assist of a bending spring. This can be a stiff metal coil of nearly exactly the same diameter as the inside of the pipe. It can be pushed in to the pipe around the point wherever the bend is usually to be made and supports the pipe during bending. The spring should be compressed a little - by turning it - just before attempting to with?draw it. You need 1 for each size of copper pipe. Pipe can also be bent using a bending machine.
<br /><br />For most modest plumbing jobs, bending springs are probably all that you just want -with these it is possible to make bends of different radii, make bends near the end of a length of pipe (but with difficulty) and bend pipes up to and including those of 22mm diameter. They are also inex?pensive to shop for, but call for effort to use.
<br /><br />For big plumbing jobs involving a lot of bending, a machine is worth having they may be exceptionally expensive to buy but can be hired. A machine takes most of the effort out of bending any size of pipe but the radius in the bend is fixed, and it requires practice to get the bend within the correct spot.
<br /><br />It is possible to get corrugated hand-bendable pipe in lengths as much as 550mm. That is easy to bend and is ideal for use in awkward situations - for example making the final connections to bath taps. Some hand-bendable pipes come with a tap connector already fitted.
