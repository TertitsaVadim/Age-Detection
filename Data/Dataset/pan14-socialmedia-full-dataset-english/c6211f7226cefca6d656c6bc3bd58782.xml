Before going to recover RAR password, you need to learn something important about WinRAR encryption. There are provided 3 kinds of tricks about this issue.
<br /><br /><strong>Trick one: A strong password</strong>
<br /><br />You may know that, WinRAR password recovery tools can recover all rar passwords theoretically, but in fact, as a strong password require a very long password recovery time (months or years), you still can protect your rar file securely with strong password.
<br /><br />A strong password should have at least eight characters that consists of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.). It should not only include the common letters and symbols on the keyboard, but also have seldom used ones. Strong passwords also do not contain words that can be found in a dictionary or parts of the file name.
<br /><br /><strong>Trick two: Password in other languages</strong>
<br /><br />As said above, we usually set English letters in the password, have you thought that we can use other languages? When setting rar password, try to include Japanese in the password. When rar file asks you to enter the password, you may find that you cannot enter Japanese letters. Don't worry. Input password in a txt file and then copy it to the password box.
<br /><br />Most WinRAR password recovery tools cannot recover password like that. So take care of the password; once you forget it, just give up the attempts to reopen it.
<br /><br /><strong>Trick three: Encrypt insignificant file with the target file</strong>
<br /><br />When <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXNzd29yZHVubG9ja2VyLmNvbS9yYXItcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">WinRAR password recovery</a></strong> tools recover rar password, generally they work on a target file, and adopt brute force attack to guess the password.
<br /><br />If we compress many files together, and then give them passwords respectively, no password recovery software will be valid for it.
<br /><br />Specific operation as follows:
<br /><br />Step 1: Prepare the important file (1.xlsx) you want to encrypt in rar and insignificant file (2.xlsx).
<br /><br />Step 2: Compress and encrypt the insignificant file (2.xlsx). Note: Do not encrypt file names.
<br /><br />Step 3: Open the rar file, click Commands in file menu and choose Add files to archive.
<br /><br />Step 4: Add the important file (1.xlsx), and go back to Archive name and parameters.
<br /><br />Step 5: In Advanced tab, set a different password. Click OK, and close rar file.
<br /><br />You will find that, when you input password of 1.xlsx to extract the rar archive, only 1.xlsx will be extracted; when you input password of 2.xlsx, only 2.xlsx will be extracted.
<br /><br />You may also try to use a WinRAR or <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXNzd29yZHVubG9ja2VyLmNvbS9yYXItcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">RAR password recovery</a></strong> tool to retrieve its password. The result is that it will only find password for 2.xlsx, and the password of important file (1.xlsx) cannot be recovered.
<br /><br />In this way, the data of 1.xlsx is securely protected.

But unfortunately, I forgot the password now, what can I do to solve this problem? How to <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXNzd29yZHVubG9ja2VyLmNvbS9rbm93bGVkZ2UvcmVtb3ZlLXJhci1wYXNzd29yZC5odG1s" target="_blank">remove WinRAR password</a></strong> without damaging the data inside?
<br /><br />If you have learned about rar password recovery, you may know that the only way to recover rar password is to make use of password recovery software. And the key point of password cracking software is the password recovery speed. Thus, all software developers are devoted to CPU and GPU acceleration to make faster speed.
<br /><br />Password Unlocker Studio works hardly and takes the advanced acceleration technology into RAR Password Unlocker.

<br /><br />How to take advantage of acceleration features in RAR Password Unlocker?
<br /><br />GPU acceleration: During software installation, please install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 redistributable, then GPU acceleration will be active during software running.

<br /><br />How to set a proper attack way?
<br /><br />If you know nothing about the password, such as a rar file protected by others, you have to use the brute force attack. But it will cost a much longer time.
<br /><br />If you can still remember some information on the forgotten password, such as the prefix characters, the suffix characters, and password length, Brute-force with Mask Attack can be the most suitable choice to solve your RAR password forgotten troubles. The more options you set, the earlier you will finish rar password recovery.
<br /><br />If the rar password is set by yourself, and you are the person who has a preference when setting a password, list all the characters you would like to contain in the password, such as your name, nickname, favorite star, birthday, etc. Then, take Dictionary Attack in RAR Password Unlocker.

<br /><br />There are generally three reasons:
<br /><br /><strong>Reason 1: The password is too strong.</strong>
<br /><br />Though the password is strong, if you can spend enough time on rar password recovery, theoretically any password can be cracked. But in fact, most people cannot spend a week or more time on it.
<br />So, to quickly retrieve rar password at that situation, RAR Password Unlocker employs leading CPU and GPU acceleration to help you run password recovery process faster and faster.
<br /><br /><strong>Reason 2: Mask settings are incorrect.</strong>
<br /><br />If you know some characteristics of the password, including length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, prefix and suffix, please make correct settings in Brute-force with Mask attacks of RAR Password Unlocker; otherwise, you will never recover rar password.
<br /><br /><strong>Reason 3: The rar is encrypted in a special way.</strong>
<br /><br />There are two encryption ways not supported by most <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXNzd29yZHVubG9ja2VyLmNvbS9yYXItcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">rar password recovery</a></strong> software.
<br /><br />Method 1 Set password in other languages
<br /><br />When setting rar password, contain Japanese in the password. While inputting the password, you may find that you cannot enter Japanese letters. Don't worry. Input password in a txt file and then copy it to the password box. Most password recovery tools cannot recover rar password in non-English letters. So take care of the password once you set it.
<br /><br />Method 2: Set different passwords for files in one rar archive
<br /><br />In general, RAR password recovery tools only work on one password protected file in a rar archive. If you compress many files together in one rar archive, and then give them different passwords as below steps, only one password can be recovered.
<br /><br />1. Prepare the important file (A.xlsx) you want to encrypt and an insignificant file (B.xlsx).
<br />2. Compress and encrypt B.xlsx. Note: Do not encrypt file names.
<br />3. Open the B.rar file, click Commands in file menu and choose Add files to archive.
<br />4. Add A.xlsx, and go back to Archive name and parameters.
<br />5. In Advanced tab, set a different password. Click OK, and close rar file.
<br /><br />Use <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wYXNzd29yZHVubG9ja2VyLmNvbS9yYXItcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">WinRAR password recovery</a></strong> tools to recover its password, software will only find password for B.xlsx, thus only B.xlsx will be opened; to extract A.xlsx, you have to input the correct password by yourself. In this way, the data in A.xlsx can be securely protected. And that is the reason why you cannot recover rar password for A.xlsx.
<br /><br />In these three reasons, only the second one can be corrected on your own. When you cannot remove rar password, check what reason it is to saving your time.
