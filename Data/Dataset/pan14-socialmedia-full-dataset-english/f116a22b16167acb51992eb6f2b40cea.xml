His father said,&quot;Son, we'd give you one, but the mortgage on this house is $280,000 &amp; your mother just lost her job. There's no way we can afford it.&quot; The next day the father saw little Joe heading out the front door with a suitcase. So he asked, &quot;Son, where are you going?&quot; Little Joe told him; &quot;I was walking past your room last night and heard you telling Mom you were pulling out. Then heard her tell you to wait because she was coming too. And I'll be damned if I'm staying here by myself with a $280,000 mortgage &amp; no bike.

What had happened to cause such a reaction, why could she feel her heart beat in her throat, why did she have butterfly's. . My god she felt like a teenager on her first date......she always did. She had been summoned, He had called her.  After two long days of waiting patiently she had answered the phone and had been abruptly told what to wear and where to be.
<br /><br />So now she removed her wedding ring, walked up to the wardrode and opened the doors, she opened the small drawers inside and reached in.  From there she removed a pair of white lace panties and a matching bra, she placed them on the bed, and then went and picked out a pair of lace topped hold up stockings, knowing He did not like suspenders.  She added these to her underwear.
<br /><br />Checking the time she realised she must hurry as she had to meet Him soon.  So she showered quickly carefully washing her hair and shaving away unwanted hair.  She stepped from the shower and wrapped a large fluffy towel around herself.  Walking back to her bedroom she started to get ready, carefully drying her long hair and applying make up.  Next came her perfume she reached up on the shelf and picked the one she knew He loved on her (He had instructed her to buy it just after He collared her as His).  Next she dressed in the underwear she had layed out earlier, to this she added a pair of white stilettos and a knee lenght coat.
<br /><br />She walked out of the bed room, down the stairs and collected her keys from the hall.  She caught sight of herself in the full lenght mirror and prayed He would be pleased.  On the drive to the hotel she kept wondering how the night would go, after all this time she could still say every time was different.  As she parked the car she tried to quiet the butterfly's in her stomach.
<br /><br />As she walked in to the hotel it felt like all eyes where on her, (could they tell what she was wearing), she felt herself blushing.  Fighting back the urge to run for the car she made herself stride to the desk head held high, cause she didn't know if he was watching, and all she wanted to do was please Him.  The desk clerk ran his eyes over her approvingly and met her with a lecherous smile.  She cooly asked for the room key, for He had taken care of everything.  Walking to lift she could feel eyes watching her and breathlessly she hoped it was Him, smiling to herself she let her hips sway a little more as she walked into the lift. 
<br /><br />Opening the door to the room she caught her breath................ He had hired a suite, she was humbled by this gesture.  Walking over to the couch she removed her coat, upon the coffee table there was a card, she picked it up and read it.  The instructions upon it bringing a smile of anticipation to her lips.  She placed the card back on the table and walked into the bed room. Making her way slowly round the room she lit the candles He had had placed in the room then she turned off the lights in the bed room. 
<br /><br />Upon the bed was a solitary silk scarf, she walked over and picked it up letting it run through her fingers she shivered.  As she had been told to she sat on the bed and tied it firmly round her head cutting off the light from the room.  Having done this she lay down on the bed and waited...........
<br /><br />After what seemed eternity she heard the door click, her breath caught in the back of her throat.  She heard him walking towards her sure footed as always.  He took His time after all there was no need to rush she was His to do as He pleased.  She heard Him place His wallet and keys on the side and then she drew a deep breath as she heard Him start to undress.  She began to squirm on the bed with anticipation, &quot;be still&quot; He commanded in a strong quiet voice, and instantly she stopped.  
<br /><br />He smiled as He watched this, she was always so eager to please.  Too Himself he thought she had never looked more beautiful than in the lobby when He had watched her knowing the turmoil she was feeling inside.  She was always hiding and He hated that made her do these things cause He knew how it made her feel but she had never failed Him yet.  He crossed to the bed and placed a solitary kiss on her lips, she drew a shaky breath and uttered one word in a whisper.... &quot; Master&quot;.
<br /><br />She was shivering from head to toe now, wondering what was to come this time.  Was He pleased or was she to be punished.  After all He was always fair but firm.  He lent in close to her ear and whispered to her &quot; i was watching you in the lobby, you hesitated when you entered why?&quot;.  She answered Him honestly knowing she would pay for lying, &quot; I was scared Master it felt that every ones eyes where on me, and for a second i wanted to go back to the car.&quot;  He chuckled and said &quot;and what stopped you little one.&quot;  To which she wished He could see her eyes and the longing there. Didn't He know the very reason she breathed was to please Him and if she'd ran she knew He would have been angry and disappointed in her.  And she couldn't bear the thought of that.  She was His mind body and soul and she would do anything for Him.  But she answered simply &quot; cause i knew you would be here, and pleasing you is all that matters Master.&quot;At this He smiled with pride, He treasured her gift to Him her complete submission.
<br /><br />That night was magical for her, her Master loved her in many ways, at times He was so gentle she was left weeping in His arms, as dawn was breaking she lay there gazing at Him and knew she was complete.  With that thought in her mind she curled up beside Him and fell into a contented sleep smiling to herself..............................................
<br /><br />The next morning she woke and the bed beside her was empty, and she sighed.  Then she heard bare feet padding on the carpeted floor, she looked up and there He was grinning at her, He walked over and sat on the bed, He lent over and kissed her and whispered in her ear, &quot;I have something for you,&quot;  she looked at Him and grinned as he slipped her wedding ring on.
<br /><br />&quot;Room service has just been and we've got to pick up the kiddies in two hours, it's time to get up lazy bones.&quot;
<br /><br />And she just smiled at her Husband, her Master, her All............................................................................................

<br />After she applied her lipstick and started to leave, the little one said,
<br />'But Gramma, you forgot to kiss the toilet paper good-bye!'
<br /><br />********************************************************************* 
<br />My young grandson called the other day to wish me Happy Birthday. 
<br />He asked me how old I was, and I told him, '62.'
<br />He was quiet for a moment, and then he asked, 'Did you start at 1?
<br /><br />*********************************************************************
<br />After putting her grandchildren to bed, a grandmother changed into old slacks and a droopy blouse and proceeded to wash her hair. As she heard the children getting more and more rambunctious, her patience grew thin. At last she threw a towel around her head and stormed into their room, putting them back to bed with stern warnings. As she left the room, she heard the three-year-old say with a trembling voice, 'Who was THAT?'
<br /><br />*******************************************************************
<br /> A grandmother was telling her little granddaughter what her own childhood was like: 'We used to skate outside on a pond. I had a swing made from a tire; it hung from a tree in our front yard. We rode our pony. We picked wild raspberries in the woods.'
<br /> The little girl was wide-eyed, taking this in. At last she said, 'I sure wish I'd gotten to know you sooner!'
<br /><br />********************************************************************
<br /> My grandson was visiting one day when he asked, 'Grandma, do you know how you and God are alike?' I mentally polished my halo while I asked, 'No, how are we alike?'
<br /> 'You're both old,' he replied.
<br /><br />************************************************************  
<br />A little girl was diligently pounding away on her grandfather's word processor. She told him she was writing a story. 'What's it about?' he asked.
<br /> 'I don't know,' she replied. 'I can't read.'
<br /><br />*********************************************************** 
<br />I didn't know if my granddaughter had learned her colors yet, so I decided to test her. I would point out something and ask what color it was. She would tell me, and always she was correct. But it was fun for me, so I continued.
<br /> At last she headed for the door, saying sagely, 'Grandma, I think you should try to figure out some of these yourself!'
<br /><br />************************************************************  
<br />When my grandson Billy and I entered our vacation cabin, we kept the lights off until we were inside to keep from attracting pesky insects. Still, a few fireflies followed us in.
<br /> Noticing them before I did, Billy whispered, 'It's no use, Grandpa. The mosquitoes are coming after us with flashlights.'
<br /><br />*********************************************************************
<br />When my grandson asked me how old I was, I teasingly replied, 'I'm not sure.'
<br />'Look in your underwear, Grandma,' he advised. 'Mine says I'm four to six.'
<br /><br />************************************************************
<br />A second grader came home from school and said to her grandmother,
<br />'Grandma, guess what? We learned how to make babies today.' The grandmother, more than a little surprised, tried to keep her cool.
<br /><br />'That's interesting,' she said, 'How do you make babies?'
<br /> 'It's  simple,' replied the girl. 'You just change 'y' to 'i' and add 'es''
<br /><br />************************************************************ 
<br />Children's Logic: 'Give me a sentence about a  public servant,' said a teacher.
<br />The small boy wrote: 'The fireman came down the ladder pregnant.'
<br />The teacher took the lad aside to correct him. 'Don't you know what pregnant means?' she asked.
<br />Sure,' said the young boy confidently. 'It means carrying a child.'
<br /><br />******************************************************************** 
<br />A nursery school teacher was delivering a station wagon full of kids home one day when a fire truck zoomed past. Sitting in the front seat of the fire truck was a Dalmatian dog.
<br />The children started discussing the dog's duties.
<br />'They use him to keep crowds back,' said one youngster.
<br />'No,' said another, 'he's just for good luck.'
<br />A third child brought the argument to a close.
<br />'They use the dogs', she said firmly, 'to find the fire hydrants

<br />Talk about a tear jerker! WOW!
<br /><br />I was walking around in a store. I saw a cashier hand this little boy his money back saying &quot;I´m sorry, but you don´t have enough money to buy
<br />this doll.&quot;
<br /><br />Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: ´´Granny, are you sure I don´t have enough money?´´
<br /><br />The old lady replied: ´´You know that you don´t have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.´´
<br /><br />Then she asked him to stay there for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly.
<br /><br />The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.
<br /><br />Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this doll to.
<br /><br />&quot;It´s the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.&quot;
<br /><br />I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her after all, and not
<br />to worry.
<br /><br />But he replied to me sadly. &quot;No, Santa Claus can´t bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.&quot;
<br /><br />His eyes were so sad while saying this. &quot;My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister.´´
<br /><br />My heart nearly stopped.
<br /><br />The little boy looked up at me and said: &quot;I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.&quot;
<br /><br />Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me &quot;I want mommy to take my picture with her so she won´t forget me.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I love my mommy and I wish she doesn´t have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister.&quot;
<br /><br />Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.
<br /><br />I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. &quot;What if we checked again, just in case you do have enough money?´´
<br /><br />&quot;OK&quot; he said &quot;I hope that I have enough.&quot; I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the
<br />doll and even some spare money.
<br /><br />The little boy said: &quot;Thank you God for giving me enough money!&quot;
<br /><br />Then he looked at me and added &quot;I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mommy can give
<br />it to my sister. He heard me!´´
<br /><br />&quot;I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn´t dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the
<br />doll and a white rose.´´
<br /><br />&quot;My mommy loves white roses.&quot;
<br /><br />A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my basket.
<br /><br />I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. I couldn´t get the little boy out of my mind.
<br /><br />Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car, where there was one young lady and a little girl.
<br /><br />The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the Life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to recover from the coma.
<br /><br />Was this the family of the little boy?
<br /><br />Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.
<br /><br />I couldn´t stop myself as I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people
<br />to see and make last wishes before burial.
<br /><br />She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest.
<br /><br />I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed forever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second,
<br />a drunk driver had taken all this away from him.
<br /><br />Now you have 2 choices:
<br /><br />1) Repost this message so ppl see what drunk driving can do
<br /><br />2) Ignore it as if it never touched you

<br /><br />Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by Arthur's youthful happiness. So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer; if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be killed. 
<br /><br />The question was: What do women really want? 
<br /><br />Such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed an impossible query. Well, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. 
<br /><br />He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester. In all, he spoke with everyone but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. 
<br /><br />What most people did tell him was to consult the old witch, as only she would know the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. 
<br /><br />The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her price first: 
<br /><br />The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises... He had never run across such a repugnant creature. He refused to force his friend to marry her and have to endure such a burden. 
<br /><br />Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He told him that nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. 
<br /><br />Hence, their wedding was proclaimed, and the witch answered Arthur's question: 
<br /><br />What a woman really wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life. 
<br /><br />Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it went. The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom. 
<br /><br />What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and anguish. 
<br /><br />Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch put her worst manners on display. She ate with her hands, belched and farted, and made everyone uncomfortable. 
<br /><br />The wedding night approached: Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific night, entered the bedroom. What a sight awaited! 
<br /><br />The most beautiful woman he'd ever seen lay before him! Gawain was astounded and asked what had happened. 
<br /><br />The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her (when she'd been a witch), half the time she would be her horrible, deformed self, and the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self. Which would he want her to be during the day and which during the night? 
<br /><br />What a cruel question? Gawain began to think of his predicament: 
<br /><br />During the day a beautiful woman to show off to his friend, but at night, in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch? Or would he prefer having by day a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful woman to enjoy many intimate moments? 
<br /><br />What would you do? 
<br /><br />Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself. 
<br /><br />Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time, because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life. 
<br /><br />What is the moral of this story? 
<br /><br />The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly...Underneath it all, she's still just a fucking witch. 
<br /><br />breast cancer month
<br /><br />Keep this one going please!!! 
<br /><br />In memory of Belinda Emmett, in appreciation of Kylie Minogue, 
<br />and anyone else you know that has been struck down by cancer 
<br />A handsome, middle-aged man walked quietly into the cafe and sat down. 
<br />Before he ordered, he couldn't help but notice a group of younger men at the table next to him. 
<br />It was obvious they were making fun of something about him, and it wasn't until he remembered he 
<br />was wearing a small pink ribbon on the lapel of his suit that he became aware of what the joke was all about. 
<br />The man brushed off the reaction as ignorance, but the smirks began to get to him. 
<br />He looked one of the rude men square in the eye, placed his hand beneath the ribbon and asked, quizzically, 
<br />This?&quot; 
<br /><br />With that the men all began to laugh out loud. 
<br />The man he addressed said, as he fought back laughter, 
<br />&quot;Hey, sorry man, but we were just commenting on how pretty your pink ribbon looks against your blue jacket!&quot; 
<br />The middle aged man calmly motioned for the joker to come over to his table and invited him to sit down. 
<br />The guy obliged, not really sure why. In a soft voice, the middle aged man said, 
<br />&quot;I wear this ribbon to bring awareness about breast cancer. I wear it in my mother's honour.&quot; 
<br />&quot;Oh, sorry dude. She died of breast cancer?&quot; 
<br />&quot;No, she didn't. She's alive and well. But her breasts nourished me as an infant and were a 
<br />soft resting place for my head when I was scared or lonely as a little boy. 
<br />I'm very grateful for my mother's breasts and her health.&quot; 
<br />&quot;Umm,&quot; the stranger replied, &quot;Yeah.&quot; 
<br />&quot;And I wear this ribbon to honour my wife&quot;, the middle aged man went on. 
<br />&quot;And she's okay, too?&quot; the other guy asked. 
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, yes. She's fine. Her breasts have been a great source of loving pleasure for both of 
<br />us and with them she nurtured and nourished our beautiful daughter 23 years ago. 
<br />I am grateful for my wife's breasts, and for her health.&quot; 
<br />&quot;Uh huh. And I guess you wear it to honour your daughter, also?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;It's too late to honour my daughter by wearing it now. 
<br />My daughter died of breast cancer one month ago. 
<br />She thought she was too young to have breast cancer, so when she accidentally noticed a small lump, she ignored it. 
<br />She thought that since it wasn't painful, it must not be anything to worry about.&quot; 
<br />Shaken and ashamed, the now sober stranger said, &quot;Oh, man, I'm so sorry mister.&quot; 
<br />&quot;So, in my daughter's memory, too, I proudly wear this little ribbon, which allows me the opportunity to enlighten others. 
<br />Now, go home and talk to your wife and your daughters, your mother and your friends. 
<br />And here,&quot; the middle-aged man reached in his pocket and handed the other man a little pink ribbon. 
<br />The guy looked at it, slowly raised his head and asked, &quot;Can ya help me put it on?&quot; 
<br />This is breast cancer awareness month. 
<br />Do regular breast self-exams and encourage those women you love to do the same. 
<br />Please send this on to anyone you would like to remind of the importance of breast cancer awareness.

<br /><br />A friend of mine handed me a little book called THE FOUR AGREEMENTS. I had to giggle, I am going emotional turmoil and he hands me a book!, yep, like that is going to help....
<br /><br />It sat on my shelf for a couple of months before I picked it up...I was sat on the sofa on my day off, done all the house chores, nothing planned and wondering what to do.. I saw the book willing for me to pick it up..Now this book is only a small read, so I thought to myself &quot;what have I got to lose&quot;
<br /><br />It started off pretty heavy, talking about everyone being in a fog...in their own reality...I put it down and thought to myself..&quot;great he as given me a religious book&quot;...But for some reason I carried on...
<br /><br />The next four chapters changed my life and the way that I saw things..(pretty powerful stuff, for a little book)
<br /><br />It said that we all make agreements with ourselves when we are children, and these agreements shape us and &quot;ruin&quot; us when we are adults..give us hangups and issues that we inflict onto others...
<br /><br />example ...The mother comes home with a bad headache, her daughter age 3, is jumping all over the sofa, singing her head off... The mother shouts.&quot;stop singing, you have a horrible voice&quot;, that child makes an agreement with her self, that would never sing again.....
<br /><br />The book tells us to &quot;get rid&quot; of all the agreements we have and just live by these four and life becomes easier....
<br /><br />1. Be impeccable with your word:
<br />Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.
<br /><br />2. Don´t take anything personally:
<br />What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.
<br /><br />3. Don´t make assumptions:
<br />Find the courage to ask questions and express that you really want. With this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.
<br /><br />4. Always do your best:
<br />Your best is going to change from moment to moment, sick vs. healthy. Under any circumstance, do your best, and you will avoid self-judgement, self -abuse and regret.
<br /><br />It made sense to me.. now I slip up all the time.. but when someone shouts at me now, I just smile and say &quot;you having a bad day?&quot; they are taken back and open up with what is on their mind...
<br /><br />It as made me look at the world in a different way and I now find people in general, quite amusing... with these 4 agreements life made sense again xx

Although unfamiliar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat out. She motors out a short distance, anchors, and reads her book.
<br /><br />Along comes a Game Warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside the woman and says, 'Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?'
<br /><br />'Reading a book,' she replies, (thinking, 'Isn't that obvious?')
<br />'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her.
<br />'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading.'
<br />'Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.'
<br /><br />'If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,' says the woman.
<br /><br />'But I haven't even touched you,' says the game warden.
<br />'That's true, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at any moment.'
<br />'Have a nice day ma'am,' and he left.
<br /><br />MORAL: Never argue with a woman who reads. It's likely she can also think .

<br />into boxes, crates and suitcases.
<br /><br />On the second day, she had the movers come and collect her things.
<br /><br />On the third day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining
<br />room table by candle-light, put on some soft background music, and feasted
<br />on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar, and a bottle of spring-water.
<br /><br />When she had finished, she went into each and every room and deposited a few
<br />half-eaten shrimp shells dipped in caviar into the hollow of the curtain
<br />rods.
<br /><br />She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. When the husband returned with
<br />his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the
<br />house began to smell.
<br /><br />They tried everything; cleaning, mopping and airing the place out. Vents
<br />were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned.
<br /><br />Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to
<br />set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days
<br />and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting.
<br /><br />Nothing worked!!!
<br /><br />People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the
<br />house. The maid quit.
<br /><br />Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.
<br /><br />A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not
<br />find a buyer for their stinky house.
<br /><br />Word got out and eventually even the local estate agents refused to
<br />return their
<br />calls.
<br /><br />Finally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a
<br />new place.
<br /><br />The ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going.
<br /><br />He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said
<br />that she missed her old home terribly and would be willing to reduce her
<br />divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back.
<br /><br />Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on a price
<br />that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were
<br />to sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour his
<br />lawyers delivered the paperwork.
<br /><br />A week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the
<br />moving company pack everything to take to their new home.........
<br /><br />And to spite the ex-wife, they even took the curtain rods!!!!!!
<br /><br />I LOVE A HAPPY ENDING, DON'T YOU?
<br /><br />Only a Woman could be so devious!

<br /><br />When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in
<br />&gt; a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 glasses of
<br />&gt; wine theory...
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; A professor stood before his philosophy class with some items on his desk
<br />&gt; in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very
<br />&gt; large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the
<br />&gt; jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas
<br />&gt; between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was
<br />&gt; full. They agreed it was.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of
<br />&gt; course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar
<br />&gt; was full. The students responded with a unanimous 'YES.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The professor then produced two glasses of wine from under the table and
<br />&gt; poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty
<br />&gt; space between the sand. The students laughed.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; 'Now,' said the professor, as the laughter subsided, 'I want you to
<br />&gt; recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the
<br />&gt; important things; your family, your children, your health, your friends,
<br />&gt; and your favorite passions; things that if everything else was lost and
<br />&gt; only they remained, your life would still be full.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house,
<br />&gt; and your car. The sand is everything else; the small stuff.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; If you put the sand into the jar first', he continued, 'there is no room
<br />&gt; for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend
<br />&gt; all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for
<br />&gt; the good things that are important to you.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play
<br />&gt; with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner
<br />&gt; out to dinner. Play another 18 holes. Do one more run down the ski slope.
<br />&gt; There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take
<br />&gt; care of the golf balls first; the things that really matter. Set your
<br />&gt; priorities. The rest is just sand.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the wine
<br />&gt; represented.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; The professor smiled. 'I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that
<br />&gt; no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple
<br />&gt; of glasses of wine with a friend.'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt; Share this with a friend... I just did.

A woman at the nightclub, 'Crow Bar'- on Saturday night was taken by 5 men,who according to hospital and police reports, gang raped her before dumping her.Unable to remember the events of the evening, tests later confirmed the repeat rapes along with traces of Rohypnol in her blood, with Progesterex,which is essentially a small sterilization pill.The drug is now being used by rapists at parties to rape and sterilize their victims.Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals.Rumor has it that Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girls drink. The girl can't remember a thing the next morning, of all that had taken place the night before.Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the victim doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist needn't worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later.THE DRUGS EFFECTS ARE NOT TEMPORARY !!!!THEY ARE PERMANENT !!!!Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses.ANY FEMALE WHO UNKNOWINGLY TAKES THE DRUG WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE!!!!!The b*&quot;%^*!s can get this drug from anyone who is in vet school or any university.It's that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big everywhere.Believe it or not, there are even sites on the Internet telling people how to use it.Please FORWARD ~ This to everyone you know, especially girls.BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE OUT AND DON'T LEAVE YOUR DRINK UNATTENDED.Please make the effort to pass this onto all you know.Guys, please inform all your female friends and relatives.This has now been reported to have been used on 360 women around London and over 900 in the United States.GIRLS !!!

<br /><br />At a fund raising dinner for a school that serves learning-disabled children, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question: 'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do. Where is the natural order of things in my son?'
<br /><br />The audience was stilled by the query.
<br /><br />The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, physically and mentally handicapped comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'
<br /><br />Then he told the following story:
<br /><br />Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.
<br /><br />Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'
<br /><br />Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. His Father watched with a small tear in his eye and warmth in his heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.
<br /><br />At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.
<br /><br />However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.
<br /><br />The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.
<br /><br />Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates. Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first! Run to first!' Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.
<br /><br />Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!' Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball ... the smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team. He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head. Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.
<br /><br />All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'
<br /><br />Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third! Shay, run to third!'
<br /><br />As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, 'Shay, run home! Run home!' Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team.
<br /><br />'That day', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, 'the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world'.
<br /><br />Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy, and coming home and seeing his Mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!
<br /><br />AND NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY:
<br /><br />We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.
<br /><br />If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren't the 'appropriate' ones to receive this type of message. Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference. We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.' So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice: Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?
<br /><br />A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats it's least fortunate amongst them.
<br /><br />You now have two choices:
<br />1. Delete
<br />2. Forward
<br /><br />May your day, be a Shay Day.
