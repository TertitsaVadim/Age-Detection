If you have a real big fix job, you need to obtain many quotes from different plumbing companies in order to get the best price.<br /><br />Most house owners will try and do as much as practicable to mend a problem so they do not have to enlist the services of a pro fix person.  There are many repairs in the home that need the services of a professional because some issues are complicated and can actually be a health hazard if not mended in the right way.  We all want to save our money when and where we will, but our plumbing systems can be very delicate.  Hiring a professional plumber can frequently save you money because the chance of a novice causing further damage is reasonably high.<br /><br />There's little worse than having a toilet overflow or a shower back up, and these things always seem to crop up at the most inopportune time.  Plumber's aren't always available when there's an emergency, so it's useful to have some basic plumbing knowledge to get yourself out of a tight spot until you are able to get a hold of an expert.<br /><br />Having a basic plumber's toolbox handy will help you fix tricky eventualities or at least temporarily solve Problems until expert plumbers are available.

In order to become a beginner plumber, you'll need a little arsenal of handy tools at your disposal.<br /><br />1.  Plunger<br /><br />The plunger, also known as a 'plumber's best friend,' will be one of the most valuable ( and frequently used ) tool you own.  Though you should buy one cost effectively for under five dollars, making an investment in a little sturdier model is a decent idea, as poorly constructed plungers simply break ( sometimes during use ) .<br /><br />A plunger is essentially used to de-clog toilets ; it can , however , be used for shower and sink drains too.  Too often people misuse this easy tool.  A good plumber knows a plunger shouldn't push clogged material into the drain, but rather works as a suction device.

Pliers<br /><br />Although you may be in a position to maneuver regular pliers to undo a screw, plumber's pliers are specially suited for these jobs.  There may come a time when you have to dismantle a fixture or tank, and when it does, you'll be glad to have a pair of these handy.<br /><br />6.  Gloves<br /><br />Keep your hands clean and dry.

To become an amateur plumber, you'll need a little arms depot of handy tools at your disposal.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />1.  Plunger&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />The plunger, also known as a 'plumber's best friend,' will be one of the most valuable ( and ordinarily used ) tool you own.  Though you can buy one on the cheap for under 5 dollars, making an investment in a marginally sturdier model is a respectable idea, as poorly made plungers easily break ( sometimes during use ) .&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />A plunger is basically used to de-clog toilets ; it can  be used for shower and sink drains as well .  Too often people misuse this easy tool.  A good plumber knows that a plunger shouldn't push clogged material into the drain, but rather works as a suction device.  You create a tight seal with the plunger round the offending drain and pull upwards to suck out any debris.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />2.  Toilet Auger&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Where plungers fail, toilet augers prevail.  These devices are infrequently called upon to 'snake' out difficult clogs that lie too deep for plungers to reach.  It resembles a pole with a crank attached at one end and flexible shaft at the other.  The shaft is inserted into the drain and will either help pull up any block or break it apart to clear the obstruction.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />3.  Adjustable Wrench&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Shower heads and other fixtures become loose, creating leaks or worse, just falling apart.  A wrench can help tighten loose nuts and bolts or can be employed to replace old or damaged fixtures.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />4.  Teflon Tape&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Sprung a leak?  Tape it up!  It is not one a pro plumber would do, but you are a beginner.  Tape can help keep your bathroom from flooding overnight or causing deadly puddles.  If you notice a pipe is leaking, a few layers of this could keep things dry long enough for you to give the plumber a call.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />5.  Pliers&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Although you could be ready to maneuver regular pliers to undo a screw, plumber's pliers are specifically suited for these jobs.  There may be a point when you have to dismantle a fixture or tank, and when it does, you will be happy to have a pair of these handy.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />6.  Gloves&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Keep your hands clean and dry.  Plumbing roles get greasy, so it's important to work with a pair of robust gloves so you don't lose your grip and accidentally hurt yourself or break something.&lt;BR&gt;<br /><br />Don't attempt any large projects without experience and plumbing information.  A good guideline is to only try to patch up leaks or unclog when absolutely necessary and when the difficulty is highly visible.&lt;BR&gt;
