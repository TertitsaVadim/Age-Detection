Example; if a panel is corrugated; take into account the corrugations in calculating the surface area of the panel. If you have not done the application of Liquid Rubber EPDM Coatings before, we would recommend you apply this in several pre-measured sections. The first section will give you a feel for the product and how fast you are able to apply this. You can then do larger areas in subsequent sections.We recommend on the first section, you apply 2 gallons first, over a pre-measured 80 sq .ft. section by applying all the 2 gallons over this 80 sq .ft. area, in an even application; you will form a 20 mil dft. thickness when cured. The key is to spread the product evenly - not thick in some sections and thin in others. In 75 deg F to 85 deg F, the product will start to thicken up in about 4 hours, so you should plan your (work sections) with in that 4 hour time frame or less.

The product does not fill cracks and crevices but will produce an even film penetrating even the smallest cracks and irregularities.
<br /><br />An example of this is, when <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pb3dhZXBkbWNvYXRpbmdzLmluZm8_" target="_blank">EPDM Coatings</a> is applied over porous surfaces such as poured concrete, pinholes will appear on the surface as the material slowly displaces the air in the pores. This surface wetting feature enables the product to be applied in a single coat over non porous surfaces and still result in complete film integrity. EPDM Liquid Rubber® is hydrophobic in its liquid as wellas the cured state and will withstand water immersion at any stage of its cure cycle. Liquid Rubber® should not be used where the material does not have exposure to oxygen such as between two impervious materials. When oxygen is available curing takes place from both top and bottom of film. There is sufficient oxygen available on most surfaces to initiate cure from the bottom. Oxygen readily penetrates films 20 mils thick. Curing is considerably retarded in thick films, however, cures do take place in thicknesses up to 75-80 mils within a three month period at temperatures over 70 degrees F. EPDM Liquid Rubber® can be applied to hot roof surfaces encountered during summer. The solvent in the system will flash off rapidly but the polymer will remain soft long enough to permit overlapping even after 1-2 hours.

Unlike TPO and PVC roofs that are often mechanically attached, an EPDM roof is most often fully-adhered. This means that it requires glues to adhere it to what’s underneath. The seams are either glued with the rest of the roof (different process, same result) or they are taped. But the point is glues used to fully adhere an EPDM roof are not cheap. Also, because it is often installed over insulation, which is mechanically-attached, significantly more fasteners are required to secure the material that the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pb3dhZXBkbWNvYXRpbmdzLmluZm8_" target="_blank">EPDM coatings</a> will be glued to.
<br /><br />One advantage of an EPDM roof is that the average sheet size can be quite large. Whereas the standard TPO system comes in rolls of 5, 8, 10, or 12 feet wide (by 50 or 100 feet long), and EPDM sheet can easily be ordered in a 50 foot by 50 foot section. This allows for fewer seams than its TPO counterpart. The average thickness for an EPDM membrane is about 45-60 mils (a mil is 0.001 of an inch; 45 mils equal 0.045 inches).
