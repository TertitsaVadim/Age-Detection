The helm of the individual is called &quot;Lunatic Fringe.&quot; He started from scratch 13 years ago. But he had built a high-technique manufacturing company valued 200 million which involved in battery manufacturing, mobile facilities, vehicles and other areas. By grafting the two main businesses of rechargeable batteries and electric cars, BYD claims to become the world's largest passenger car manufacturer in 2025.Normally, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2dzYm9vdHNhbGUudWsuY29tL1VnZ19Cb290c19DbGFzc2ljX0NhcmR5" target="_blank">ugg classic cardy</a> Would be the Best Wearing for Dinner
<br /><br />This simple and innocent AnHuiese has won the Bachelor of Physical Chemistry. In 1995, he devoted himself to the cellphone battery industry with 2.5 million yuan that was borrowed from his cousin who were engaged in secuirty. BYD leisurely catches up from the nickel battery to a lithium battery, once it makes the bigwigs like Sony, Sanyo and other industry fear. When people marvel at Wang Chuanfu’s aggressive development in battery industry, he changed into the severely competitive car industry. Now, someone says BYD is real competitor of Toyoto in future.How to Protect the Shape of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2dzYm9vdHNhbGUudWsuY29tL1VnZ19Cb290c19DbGFzc2ljX1RhbGw_" target="_blank">ugg classic tall</a> ?
<br /><br />Some media commented that Wang Chuanfu despise the present commercial order and game principles, as if they have found the Chinese King Kong. &quot;He trusts young engineers more than senior European technical expert. He thinks he can make everything by himself.&quot; “He also believes that the created things are better than those bought in high prices. In his opinion, technical monopoly is a paper tiger.”
<br /><br />Before, to get a low easy job, they lowered their identity, survive in the global industrial sectors. Today, however, a &quot;technical group&quot; leader has finally come out. Wang Chuanfu has changed the image of Chinese entrepreneurs. He interested in the technological innovation and organized a real localization team for the research and development and manufacturing. They are never afraid of core technology. They can do what others do, and think what others dare not to think. When every part of BYD meets difficulties, they will all say that if you could not solve the problems, it means that you lack of courage rather than you are incapable.
<br /><br />What is more valuable is that technology research and development of artificial and very respected, so that BYD particularly focus on the &quot;vertical integration&quot; of industry chain. As long as the customers request, they can provide one-stop service from design to final production. Wang says OEM is but a service provided by BYD. More importantly is that they are selling components and their own technologies.
<br /><br />In Wang’s view, Chinese engineers are among the best because they always put work before enjoyment. He said Chinese entrepreneurs are fortunate in the care of God, and we only know how to control the past, workers, engineers do not know how to organize. He stressed that the real advantage of “Made in China” is to make full use of the senior personnel and low-level personnel and to allow them to give free play to their ability.

<br /><br />First, do not over pursue high-class gasoline; many car owners know that if a luxury car uses low-grade gasoline for a long time, except knockings, many other chain effects will come up, such as the decreasing of power, the increasing demand of gasoline, and the like. But many owners do not know that the petrol is not the higher grade the better. The grade of petrol is just the parameters of antiknock ability of petrol. It has no necessary relation with the cleanness and fuel-efficient function. We should follow the instructions on the oil standard to decide what kind of gas to add and make the automobile engine compression ratio adapt to parameters of gasoline antiknock.
<br /><br />When many owners are choosing lube, they think the lube's grade is higher, it is better, the more famous one, it's better. In fact this is not needed, and lubricants should be based on the requirements of the engine choice.
<br /><br />The changing period of anti-freeze liquor is two years or driving every thirty thousand to forty thousand kilometers. Some anti-freeze liquor will have a few floc after putting aside for a year, and this phenomenon is mostly caused by additive’s separating out, and no need to throw it away. If there are plenty of particle precipitations, it shows that the anti-freeze liquor is already metamorphosed and can not be used any more.
<br /><br />Generally the automobile's air filter should be replaced in 20,000 km, we have to check in 10,000 km, windshield wipers need to be replaced every six months or one year. As it were, the air filter and windshield wiper are the cheapest parts in the prices of the car, and the inspection and the replacement of both are very simple, and it is unworthy to waste time and the money to go to the maintenance station specially, and you could replace simple parts.
<br /><br />Some owners usually add a number of fuel less than half tank, then they add fuel when it is going to run out again, in fact, this will make the upper parts of fuel tank cannot get cool, and it will easily burn and damage. To replace a fuel pump calls several hundred dollars, it is really penny wise and pound foolish. The correct approach is that keep track of the consumption of oil mass, and always keep the oil not less than one-third of the tank.
<br /><br />&quot;Excess insurance&quot; never can be justified: over-insurance, the insurance policy is higher than the actual value of the subject matter insured, such as buying a car worth 120,000 Yuan, insured 300,000 Yuan for the amount of theft insurance, if the total are lost, obtain compensation can only be 120 thousand Yuan. Generally speaking, the insurance amount shall not exceed the insure value, if it is more than the insured value, the excess is invalid. Namely, the insurant could only get relative compensation when the object of insurance occurred loss, and he could not get the benefit which is higher than the value of the object of insurance from buying insurance.
<br /><br />Presently, most main trend cars will carry out after-sell benefic activities at the time of seasons changing, such as free checking, hours fee discounting and parts promotions, and the like. Owners need to pay your attention on major newspapers' car edition, and try to take part in when you see free activity.

How to Find Your Perfect <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYmVyY3JvbWJpZTRzYWxlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a> Wuliangye has launched high-end gift wine, we should analyze the long-term strategy from &quot; the representative of high-end liquor, the Wuliangye of the world&quot;Easy Tips to Fit <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYmVyY3JvbWJpZTRzYWxlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a> 
<br /><br />First level: manufacturing extra competition, setting up he barriers of high-end liquor. How to Ways The strategy of making competitors for themselves is to set many competitive and opposite subbrands of different names in a certain kind of product or a certain position of it. These sub-brands create the overheated competition situation, which increases the risk awareness to enter this field for other brands and makes the enterprise win the whole profit.
<br /><br />The second step: shorten the brand front, and build the brand pyramid. The white wine sales industry has already been familiar with the strategy of Wuliangye’s establishing brand pyramid; but how did Wuliangye try to establish this brand pyramid? There are 8 region brands close to ordinary customers' public brand, it is the basics. Other nine national brands are the bridge to connect the base and the top, which is reflected on only on the brand image, but also the price, the image decides the value. Since they have the support of price, they have a bigger profit space for relative prices, which is the reason of attracting Wuliangye’s brand outright purchasing people.
<br /><br />While the recent released new products of Wuliangye,from its packaging to positioning, all focus its marketing on the nine national brands and has less district distinction. Therefore, this is also the reason for many new brands to take up the one in nineth of chinese liquor. In addition, through breeding these nine national brands and eliminating some too low end sub-brand, Wuliangye has also established its high end brand image.
<br /><br />The third layer: Creating the world’s Wuliangye. The representative of Chinese liquor is wine which is the consensus of the whole world; while Wuliangye is the king of Chinese liquor, and this is our consensus; So, it is nature for Wuliangye to make itself known and sweet to the people all over the world in its next step. China is a state of ceremonies since ancient times, and Wuliangye has produced high-end ritual wine series in due time, its purpose is to win the world wine industries, and make Chinese bouquet float over the world. Among which, the newly launched sub-brand business courtesy wine is even put clearly as “Chinese people’s gift wine”. What is the meaning of this? It means the more of Chinese, the more of the world.
<br /><br />We all know that the competition of the sub-brands of Wuliangye is extraordinary your opinion. However, when looking beyond, we can see that Wuliangye is the real winner. In the recent two years, Wuliangye has kept reducing its low end brands and are reckoned as giving up an enormous market. But its nature lies in “As good lost as found”. Lost the low-end market is in order to get more high-end market and the broader world market, and it is the brand strategy core of Wuliangye in these years.

The Best <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2dzYm9vdHNhbGUudWsuY29tL1VnZ19Cb290c19DbGFzc2ljX1RhbGw_" target="_blank">ugg classic tall</a> for Gathering About 44 billion years ago, a celestial body in size of Mars came into collision with newly-formed earth and these fragments finally form moon. 650 million years ago, a huge asteroid hit earth, resulting to extinguish of dinosaur. It seems that beside birds, no animals having blood relationship with dinosaur survived. 12.9 thousands years ago, a large-scaled meteor shower caused by fragments of comet happened in ice field of north American.Iâ€™ll Have What Katherine Heigl Having: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy51Z2dzYm9vdHNhbGUudWsuY29tL1VnZ19Cb290c19DbGFzc2ljX1RhbGw_" target="_blank">ugg classic tall</a> 
<br /><br />The sudden disaster may directly lead to the extinction of the mammoth and other large mammals, and the disappearance of the ancient Indian Clovis civilization. Kiss of foreign objects and us had been always together; just the scales were in great diversity. At 7:14 am on June 30th, 1908, an asteroid or a comet exploded over Siberia. Large tracts of forests are radically pulled down; people in London that night can easily read the newspaper without lighting. On October 9th, 1992, a fire meteor brighter than the full moon crossed the sky and fell on a Chevrolet car. In July, 1994, the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 which was torn into pieces by Jupiter gravity crashed into Jupiter directly, like a comet train. It left Jupiter many scars; one of them can hold the whole Earth. In September, 2007, with a loud bang, a meteor flew across the sky and fell on some place which was not far from a village in Peru, punched a 4.5 meter, 13 meter-wide pit. On October 7, 2008, a 2 to 5 meters in diameter asteroid exploded over Sudan in less than 20 hours after it was found.
<br /><br />Now scientists have reached consensus that the impact of the asteroids with 1 km in diameter can cause a global catastrophe, whose chain reactions may lead to human destruction. However, the scientists have not yet reached a consensus that how big exactly the rate that an asteroid with 1 km in diameter knocks with the Earth is. It is estimated that it may happen in every 100000 years, and still others say every 500000 years or even every three million years. Although the great destructive power can spread worldwide, but according to all estimates that the impacts are extremely rare. More generally is that the impact which is similar to the Tunguska event, it is estimated that the frequency of its occurrence is in every 1,000 years, of course, some people think that would be more frequent. The scale of the disaster caused by the impact is localized. like the explosion of atomic booms. It is like 1000 thousands tons of TNT or 500 atomic booms. However, even smaller crash is destructive.
<br /><br />Although these crash are chilling without the consideration of the size, they are the only technology can prevent the disaster form the sky at present. The source of the crash is the asteroids or comets. But we even haven’t known exactly how many object with the diameter between 100 meters to several kilometers in the solar system right now. Until August 5, 2009, we have known 6244 asteroids that near the Earth and the largest diameter are 32 kilometers. But here exists a rather troublesome problem; some small near-Earth objects can be found only when they are closest to the Earth. These objects are usually several hundred meters to 1 km in diameter, which can destroy a city or cause serious ecological crisis. But now we only know a small part of them. They are very weak, and only can be found when they fly near to the earth, because they will become obvious relative to the movement of stellar. So if there is an asteroid hitting the earth within a few days, then how should we save ourselves?
<br /><br />In fact, now it has been available to exactly predict the clash site and place of the small objects. Take the crash in Sudan on October 7, 2008, the prediction error of crash site and time was only several kilometers and a few seconds. However, accurate information about this collision place do not make for public for various reasons. So it is wise choice to drive on north after fill up your gasoline tank, since area of Ecliptic surface is more easily to suffer collision compared with other places. Because the asteroid's orbit within the solar system is basically in the vicinity of the ecliptic plane Of course, this is only a based guess. It is noteworthy that scatter family members to different areas will maximize the chance of survive. Never stay near the sea at the same time, the impact triggered by the tsunami will be swept away will sweep away all.
<br /><br />Scientists also are studying a variety of objects can be changed to track the way offenders, although most of the current point of view is still impractical, but technology developments are often far beyond our imagination. More importantly, in this &quot;day&quot; disaster of the duel, we currently have enough time. Although the consequences of impact of small objects is very serious, but that is an event with small probability, at least it will not happen to you after reading this article next day.

<br /><br />The scientific data say that there is a new continent forming between the Hawaii and California on the Pacific Sea. Actually it is a drifting body made of floating plastic and waste which are waved by the sea water, weighing hundreds of tons, covering an area about 14 million square kilometers. Scientists name it “Great Pacific Garbage Patch”; the media call it “the Eighth Continent”. Among the residents, there are football shoes from USA, ruined part of fishing net from Japan, container outline from Canada, rubber circle from Korea, plastic bag from China. They would gather in the standard of United Nations. At present, this continent is still growing and has not formed solid land; beside the part which expands beyond seas of 1.4 square kilometers, its areas have doubled.
<br /><br />The total volume of the trash reached over 7 millions with 3.3 million big and small plastic pieces on every square kilometer of sea surface. What’s more worrying is that it is not the only “Garbage Continent” on the ocean. Because there are four similar large-scale ocean swirl in the world. The scientists determine that they exist the aggregation of marine litters with different levels. Hawaii is the bright pearl in Pacific and its view is like the heaven when you go there for travel; Guam’s coasts will not loss the much impression of “blue, clear and white”. But &quot; the continent&quot; is formed beside us, and we &quot;indulge&quot; ourselves in the &quot;beauties&quot;, because people are used to take the ocean as a extremely large garbage dump, even regard the public sea as &quot;the most ideal&quot; place.

There are still startling &quot;non-low-carbon event&quot; in the places people cherish so much. Seabirds are poisoned by junk food, and the marine lives die from suffocation.
<br /><br />The most terrible thing is the marine animal eating the poisoned pollution and the poison may one day be put at the dining-table through the way of the food chain. Charles. the discoverer of the eighth land expresses pessimistically that even if we deplete the financial resources of all countries, we can not remove the junks of north pacific grye. Therefore, the majority of scientists around the world believed that “the prevention” is bigger than “the improvement”; it is the most important and most effective to prevent from the source.
<br /><br />Everyone may be the maker of marine litter. You will become the sinner of &quot;the history&quot; if you are careless. Therefore, maintain the environment, keep the low-carbon life, start from me!
