<br /><br />SAN JOSE, Calif. – At next week’s Design West conference, Micron will discuss the road map for its Hybrid Memory Cube, one of the high profile initiatives in a growing wave of 3-D chip stacks. The memory maker is adding new supporters and specifications around its plan for a release of an ultra-dense memory device in the first half of next year.
<br /><br />Micron hopes to name two new supporters in the next few weeks to its currently slate of six companies. It already has backing from Altera, OpenSilicon, Samsung, Xilinx and IBM which made a prototype cube in a 32 nm process. Last September, Intel showed a research project on a physical-layer device that worked with Micron’s cube.
<br /><br />The Hybrid Memory Cube is a stack of four to eight DRAM die linked in a 3-D IC chip stack using through silicon via. They are joined to a logic die that can handle both the RAS/CAS memory-array access jobs of a DRAM chip and the system memory controller functions typically done by a separate chip.
<br /><br />Designers envision placing the Micron stack on a chip substrate next to a server or network processor to provide new levels of fast memory access for high performance systems. Micron says it will deliver early next year 2 and 4 Gbyte versions of the stack providing aggregate bi-directional bandwidth of up to 160 Gbytes/second.
<br /><br />Members of Micron’s consortium are still debating exactly what jobs the logic layer in the stack should support, particularly as the latest server processors already embed memory controllers. Micron prefers to provide the full complement of DRAM and system control in the cube.
<br /><br />The debate is one of the central issues in creating an interface for the cube. Micron and partners hope to deliver a draft of that interface in June, initially open only to members of its consortium of partners. Another issue is whether or how to support atomic transactions, a method for aggregating tasks particularly helpful for multicore processors.
<br /><br />The cube spec in development is described as a high-speed serial interface using a packet protocol. Micron hopes the group can finish the spec by the end of the year, making it generally available on a royalty-free basis.
<br /><br />Micron is not alone in the pursuit of a 3-D memory stack. The Jedec group is working on a follow on to the 12.8 Gbit/second Wide I/O interface that targets mobile applications processors. The so-called HB-DRAM or HBM effort is said to target a 120-128 Gbyte/second interface and is led by the Jedec JC-42 committee including representatives from Hynix and other companies.

<br /><br />WASHINGTON – The current strong gains in hiring makes the Federal Reserve policymakers worried that it could buzz if the economic growth of the US doesn’t go up.
<br /><br />According to the Fed’s minutes on Tuesday, members were first stated their concerns before they make a plan to keep interest rates at record lows until at least late year 2014. However, some of the members want to take further procedures to improve the economy current status if a condition gets worse or inflation remains reclaimed.
<br /><br />After the meeting, Fed presented the somewhat current view of the economy mainly because of the three consecutive months of hiring in two years. It was concluded that there have been similar raptures of hiring in the previous two years which ended up fading.
<br /><br />On the speech echoed by the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week in the economists gathering, the decline of the economy recovery was the main concern of Fed as it did last year.
<br /><br />Americans aren’t receiving meaningful pay augmentation. Gas prices are high. Additionally, Europe’s debt crisis could reflect on the U.S economy. Provided that the inflation will remain on its current position, analysts think that the Fed will likely give interest rates down in order for them to give the economy an additional support. Most of the economists don’t think that Fed officials will alter their interest-rate policy at their following meeting on April 24-25 and will only relieve credits if the economy gradually moves from its current status.
<br /><br />The economy outlook is going up. Employers added an average of 245,000 jobs a month from December through February. On the other side, the rate of unemployed dropped nearly to 8.3%. The government will report Friday on the job market in March. Most of the economists supposed that the report will give a better month of job creation with a net gain of 210,000 jobs. They also expect that the unemployment rate will remain at 8.3%.

<br /><br />February 15, 2012 – LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – (Kazor.com) – Britain is once again suffering a recession and unemployment risks coming close into three million this year as forecasted by the leading economic forecaster. The UK’s economic recovery is ‘paralyzed’ by Europe’s debt crisis, the Ernst &amp;amp; Young Item club will warn, as it cut its GDP growth forecast from 1.5 per cent to 0.2 per cent. According to Eldridge Financial Blog, the dire prediction comes after nine European countries including France, have had their credit ratings downgraded on Friday, dropping world stock markets into turmoil.
<br /><br />Economists had hoped that exports and business investment would strengthen the economy this year, with public and consumerspending still in the doldrums. Nevertheless, Europe accounts for more than 40 percent of British trade and business confidence has been roughly hit by insecurity about the future of the Continent and the single currency. On Eldridge Financial Blog in the Sunday Telegraph quoted Professor Peter Spencer, chief economist at the Item Club, as saying: ‘Figures for the last quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of this year are likely to show that we are back in recession, and we are going to have to wait until summer before there are signs of improvement. Although he said the double dip was unlikely to be prolonged, he warned that unemployment was nevertheless likely to hit three million by early next year. Figures set for release on Wednesday are expected to show the jobless figures continued to rise in the three months up until the end of November. Professor Spencer admitted that the Item Club’s predictions were based on positive assumptions about European policymakers’ ability to keep the euro zone from falling apart. The longer the uncertainty continues, the more debilitating the impact will be on the UK’s economic prospects, he added. The European Commission vice-president for economic affairs, Olli Rehn, yesterday attacked the decision by Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s to cut down the credit ratings of so many European countries.
<br /><br />The downgrades were ‘inconsistent’, claiming that the euro zone was taking ‘decisive action’ over the economic crisis.

<br /><br />JEDDAH: A prestigious forum is being held in Jeddah today to help women in the Kingdom to improve their understanding of real estate investments, focusing particularly on the British market.
<br /><br />It will take place at Dar Al-Hekma College, a private, non-profit institution of higher education for women.
<br /><br />“This is the first of its kind event in Saudi Arabia. This is an educational initiative to equip Saudi women with a tool to invest in real estate in the UK,” said Azeemeh Zaheer, vice president of London-based Gatehouse Bank and a key presenter at the special forum.
<br /><br />Gatehouse, a Shariah-compliant bank, is holding the event in partnership with CBRE.
<br /><br />“Saudi women getting more and more involved in wealth management. This is a big change compared to five to 10 years ago,” Azeemeh told Arab News yesterday.
<br /><br />She said: “Women control 22 percent of the $7 trillion assets under management in the Middle East. This makes them an extremely influential investor group.”
<br /><br />Azeemeh added: “These women are an inspiring segment of the business and investor landscape. At the forum, we hope to give them a solid understanding of what real estate investment can do for them - to generate and preserve their wealth for the benefit of their family and their own well being. Helping boost their long-term wealth preservation, while observing their specific needs for security and safety in financial products that appeal to their risk appetite.”
<br /><br />She said: “As a Shariah-compliant bank, Gatehouse has gained extensive working experience in the GCC and over time we have developed a deep network of relationships with an increasing number of professional women clients.”
<br /><br />Azeemeh said Muna AbuSulayman, a leading Saudi figure and Arab media personality in the Middle East, is a keynote speaker at the forum.
<br /><br />Leadership ME was conducted in collaboration with CBRE, a Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company that is the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm.
<br /><br />Karen Queen, executive director of capital markets at CBRE, another presenter at the forum, said: “We are pleased to be partnering with Gatehouse and Dar Al-Hekma at this inspiring forum for women in Jeddah to discuss real estate fundamentals.”
<br /><br />She said: “London and the UK remain an attractive location for real estate investment, and characteristically more than a large percent of potential investors believe that the UK was the best place to spend their money. We acknowledge that women will continue to play an influential role as part of this landscape, and our aim is to empower them with more insights and information to help them access opportunities for wealth creation and preservation.”
<br /><br />Queen said the Middle East investors have invested 4.2 billion euros in the UK property market in 2011.
<br /><br />“The half of the total investment in the UK property market came from non-European buyers,” she pointed out.
<br /><br />“The major investment came from North America and a large sum came from the Middle East. The major non-European buyers into the UK property market include North America (over 13 billion euros), Asia (5 billion euros), and Australia (0.9 billion euros),” Queen added.
<br /><br />Azeemeh said Gatehouse Bank provides Shariah-compliant financing for real estate transactions.
<br /><br />She said Gatehouse Bank were actively realizing business in the Saudi, most recently, working with a CMA regulated Shariah-compliant financial services company based in Saudi Arabia, Sidra Capital to launch a 100 million-pound real estate fund called “SURF”.
<br /><br />On the UK real estate market, Queen said: “Women are looking for safe havens and the UK is ultimate safe place for commercial real estate. The market is transparent and the tax system is flexible.”
<br /><br />Dar Al-Hekma College will be hosting this forum for business students, alumni, and professional working women. The forum will help attendees gain knowledge on ways of improving their understanding of real estate investment fundamentals, and specifically learning how to invest in dynamic markets of London and the UK.

<br /><br />LONDON (Reuters) -Ernst &amp; Young report said on Tuesday, Britain could drive 13 billion pounds ($21 billion)into its economy and make up to 10,000 jobs by improving its power distribution network with smart grid technologies.
<br /><br />The technology has the possibilities to change the way electricity is generated, distributed and consumed just as the internet changed the way the world communicates, Smart network advocates said. In order to maximize competence in supply and demand and to reduce costs that is for home and businesses – even for those opting for low-carbon technologies, such as electric cars or solar power, the idea is to create a huge communication network. However utilities director at Ernst &amp; Young said that this kind of advancement will require an added investment of 23 billion pounds and up to 2050, a business as usual approach using conventional technology will cost 42 billion, Bill Easton claimed.
<br /><br />According Easton reported in Micron Associates, upon realizing the said advancement, many can expect to vision a wider economic significance in the UK, providing a salutation boost to growth, jobs as well as exports. In addition, these could include close to 10,000 new jobs and exports in excess of 5 billion (pounds). But the report recognizes faces up such as whether the conventional or proposed government-backed plans will give results, and that the adoption of smart grid technologies is likely to be slow, with little investment before 2023.
<br /><br />To enable governments to monitor the demands of energy by 2019, they created plans for every household and business that is fitted with a smart meter in which requires the substitution of some 53 million gas and electricity meters, Micron Associates quoted.
<br /><br />The manager of the Smart Grid GB, said that the UK doesn’t have enough money to take a “wait-and-see” approach if it wants to be a world leader in smart grid technology, as China, the United States and others are also in the creation of systems similar to them.
<br /><br />If there is a failure in deploying smart grid, the advancement of clean tech industries and mounting domestic electric costs will be in hampered.

Moreover, the world’s largest independent mobile ad network InMobi says that there are a number of ads seen by consumers on mobile phones boosts 21 percent in January-March over the previous quarter to 283 billion.

<br />        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><br />Brookfield Infrastructure posted strong results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 with funds from operations (“FFO”)(1) totalling $108 million ($0.58 per unit) compared to FFO of $98 million ($0.62 per unit) in the first quarter of 2011. Results reflect a significant increase in FFO from Brookfield Infrastructure’s transport and energy segment, partially offset by below average performance in its timber business. Per unit FFO of $0.58 was modestly lower than the prior year due to the impact of an equity issuance in October of last year, which primarily funded the expansion of the Partnership’s Australian railroad. Cash flow from this investment will continue to rise over the next four quarters. Following a 7% distribution increase in February 2012, the payout ratio(3) for the quarter will be 65%, at the mid-point of the targeted range of 60% to 70%.
<br /><br />“Organic growth initiatives, such as the expansion of our Australian railroad, are beginning to contribute meaningfully to our business. Cash flow from this investment will continue to ramp up during the course of the year,” said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure Group. “We are working on a number of opportunities to increase the cash flow in all our operating platforms by developing organic projects and selectively making acquisitions.”
<br /><br />Segment Performance
<br /><br />Brookfield Infrastructure’s increase in FFO was primarily driven by the Partnership’s transport and energy segment with FFO of $62 million, compared to $45 million the previous year. This segment’s strong performance reflects a doubling of FFO from its Australian railroad, as a result of contribution from three expansion projects that have been commissioned and an increase in grain volume following a record harvest in Western Australia.
<br /><br />Brookfield Infrastructure’s utilities segment generated FFO of $65 million in the first quarter of 2012, versus $61 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in FFO was driven by inflation indexation, favourable foreign exchange rates, and additions to rate base across the majority of its operations.
<br /><br />Brookfield Infrastructure’s timber operations reported FFO of $6 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $10 million in 2011. This segment’s performance was negatively impacted by a decline in realized prices due to a build up of inventory primarily in the Chinese market, which was partially offset by firm demand from Japan.

<br /><br />CHICAGO —Men hardly ever get breast cancer, but those those who do often don’t survive as long as women, largely because they don’t even realize they can get it and are slow to recognize the warning signs, review onMicron Associates.
<br /><br />Women with breast cancer lived two years in average longer that men in the biggest study yet of the disease in males. In fact, men found out that their breast tumors were larger at diagnosis which is more developed and more likely to crawl other parts of the body. Based from the study released on Micron Associates men were also diagnosed later in life, 63 on average versus 59 for women.
<br /><br />Mostly men don’t have an idea that they can get breast cancer, and some doctors too. 1in one 1, 000 will get breast cancer versus 1in 8 women, as estimates by American Cancer Society. By contrast, 1 ion 6 men will get prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men. As it was analyzed,10 years of national data on breasts cancer cases, from 1998 to 2007. In opposition to 1.4 million women,a total of 13,457 male patients were diagnosed. The men who were studied lived an average of about eight years after being diagnosed, compared with more than 10 years for women. The study doesn’t indicate whether patients died of breast cancer or something else.
<br /><br />A breast cancer specialist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, Dr. Akkama Ravi stresses the research bolsters results in smaller studies and may help raise awareness.Due to the fact that disease is so extraordinary in men, research is limited, as well as doctors are left to treat it the same way they manage the disease in women, she said. Additionaly,men’s breast tumors might be biologically different from women, some doctors said. On the Micron Associates healthy lifestyle news release ,men with early-stage disease had worse survival rates than women with early-stage cancer. But men’s older age at diagnosis also might explain that result, Greif said.
<br /><br />However, men’s breast cancer causes are not well-studied, but some of the same things that increase women’s chances for developing it also affect men, including older age, cancer-linked gene mutations, a family history of the disease and heavy drinking.

<br /><br />Nowadays,only having a six outlets on a strip seems more and more insufficient. Similarly, USB hubs of the past with only a handful of ports have become deficient.
<br /><br />According to Micron Associates, USB jack plugs into your computer for communication, but (for when you’ve got more than just a few devices plugged in) it gets most of its power through an AC adapter. 12-Port USB 2.0 Hub makes use of a pair of switches that individually control two separate six-port banks. So you can save some energy, if you’ve got fewer gadgets plugged in. On the other hand, if you’re crawling with devices, you can daisy chain additional strips to have up to 127 ports!
<br /><br />In the test conducted, the strip did fine for a portable monitor (that normally hogs two of your laptop’s four USB ports), a wireless mouse, charging and synching a smartphone, printing, plus loading songs as well as radio stations.
