<br /><br />well, you will not get the next payment unless you make another sale, beyond any doubts you will have to sell another car. It just sounds like any other job to me, doesn't it?
<br /><br />The next step would be to get the car insured as they have to be right? The insurance agent sells the same customer insurance, but there is a catch here!. 
<br /><br />The agent gets paid, too. But, the main difference is every time another insurance payment  has to be made, the insurance affiliate gets one more commission check. 
<br /><br />Doesn't this sound attractive?  Make a sale today,  and earn repetitive income forever! This is called as a stream of continuous flow of income. Now, the insurance agent will make sure he will make another sale within the next couple of days, this will give him get more and more residual income, in the coming years.

<br /><br />It costs you the same $25 to market and make one sale. By next year, the total income is $600, out of which $575 is the net profit for each sale All you have to do is go on making sales, and the profit that you make out of each sale would keep compounding. 
<br /><br />If you become successful in getting one sale every day for 3 months continuously, your repetitive income could be more than $3750! In just an years time, your residual income might be quite considerable staggered evenly even if you quit promoting.
<br /><br />However, now the important question is. Wheredo I become aware of a residual income program for me? Here are some options that you can choose from. Start your own. That includes: 
<br /><br />* Start a sending out updates with latest information. Getting paid opt-ins to a newsletter you write on topics that you have expertise in is one.

The answer is most definitely yes - many bloggers are finding out that they could be taking advantage of passive income streams and earning while they write. Blogging is booming, as more and more of us join up. Who doesn't want to become a published writer with a number of loyal fans?
<br /><br />Once people discovered that writing a blog could be a profit making endeavor, even more of them took it up. A few passive income ideas, a good blog (and they exist on nearly every subject), and the love of writing can be real profit makers. There are passive income streams all over for those who understand what to do with them.
<br /><br />However, the world is full of bloggers who aren't really making all that much cash. The people making the most and using their passive income ideas to the fullest are truly passionate about what they do. After all, no one wants to read content that even the writer had no interest in. The readers are important in any attempt to get the most out of passive income streams. No one should forget that the readers are where the profit comes from. Ignoring the readers means losing the chance at a good income.
<br /><br />The people most likely to fail, even if they have excellent passive income ideas, are the ones who blog on anything and everything. That might seem unusual, since a general audience blog would theoretically appeal to more people. However, the reality is that visitors want blogs to be about just one thing. Sites that skip around to different topics or that never follow through are likely to lose their audience, or to never get a good one in the first place.
<br /><br />Truly successful bloggers will be producing something their readers actually want. These blogs also have well targeted advertising that will actually engage that reader base. That's why that targeted traffic is so useful. Writers who want to get everything they can out of blogging will put together strong writing and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jsb2dnZXJzcGF5Y2hlY2suY29t" target="_blank"><strong>passive income streams</strong></a>  that aren't easy to disrupt. The end result is a steady flow of income without a lot of extra work.
