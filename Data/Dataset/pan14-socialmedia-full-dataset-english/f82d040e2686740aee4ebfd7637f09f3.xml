Subsequent in significance comes the wearing of a hernia help garment to retain the hernia &quot;in&quot;. This is crucial. If the hernia is allowed to continue to be protruding, it will protect against the gap in the abdominal wall from healing up.<br /><br />Currently most physicians and surgeons do not prescribe trusses, and some positively discourage them. Even these days some trusses use metal springs to apply stress to the hernia, through a pad which can be very hard, and which presses into the hernia.
