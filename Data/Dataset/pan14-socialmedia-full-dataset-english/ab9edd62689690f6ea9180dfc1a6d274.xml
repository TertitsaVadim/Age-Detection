It is estimated that offshore tax abuses cause the united states to lose approximately $100 billion on a yearly basis in tax revenues. Recovering these funds represent an important portion of the twelve-monthly U. S. tax gap, which is why President Obama has authorized an additional $128 million for that 2010 IRS budget, which include the addition of 800 new IRS agents. Do not be fooled, they have declared war on you and are coming after Your cash. <br /><br />First, they are going after the companies you help because they see companies operating abroad being a viable source of additional revenues. Currently, companies with overseas operations pay Oughout. S. taxes only if they bring the profits back to the country. They can defer paying U. S. taxes indefinitely once they keep the profits ocean going. Obama's plan, which would probably take effect in 2011, cracks down on these loopholes to make sure that companies would no longer be able to write off domestic expenses for generating profits abroad. It is estimated that this change alone would generate $210 billion in new taxes in the next 10 years, making a modest dent in that forecasted $1. 8 trillion govt deficit. Rest assured, this administration will encourage any possible avenue so as to bring these monies back into the U. S. <br /><br />And, they are coming after YOU. The recently released IRS report in the 2006 tax year indicates that Foreign Earned Income Exclusion may be another modest source for helping to fill the tax gap. In tax year 2006, approximately U. S. taxpayers experiencing abroad reported approximately $36. 7 billion in foreign-earned income and claimed nearly $18. several billion in income exeptions. And that was 3 years ago. There are more Americans living and working abroad now than ever. Can't you just see the wheels turning in the minds of our government leaders? Removing that Foreign Earned Income Exemption could add billions to U. S. tax coffers. <br /><br />Perhaps you think they won't find PEOPLE. The historic legal struggle that has cracked Switzerland's renowned reputation for banking secrecy is part of an on-going IRS quest to identify nearly 52, 000 suspect offshore bank accounts. When the IRS increases their labourforce by 800 new agents, they won't be choosing new college recruits. They have announced that they can be hiring the cool attorneys and investment advisors that have helped hide those means offshore. Now, multiply the number of suspected offshore accounts by the $10, 000 or quite possibly $20, 000 in permitted fines for non-reporting, and you discover another modest number toward the filling of the U. S. tax gap. If you have been one of those 'tax evaders' thinking they are able to hide assets in ocean going bank accounts, think all over again. <br /><br />Copyright (c) 2009 Nick Hodges<br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N0ZXJsaW5nbGF3cjgyMDQ2OC53ZWJzLmNvbS9hcHBzL2Jsb2cvc2hvdy8xMDAwMDA5MS1leHBhdHJpYXRlLXRheC1sYXc_" target="_blank">Expatriate Tax Law</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N0ZXJsaW5nbGF3cjgyMC5saXZlam91cm5hbC5jb20vNTIxLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Guide to Expatriate Taxation in Thailand</a>

He thinks to hide this motive behind recent White House announcements concerning U. S. companies, providing smokescreens like: &quot;I want to see our companies remain the most competitive in the world, &quot; and &quot;... the way make sure that happens is not to reward our companies for moving jobs off our shores or transferring profits to overseas tax havens. &quot;<br /><br />The the truth is that with tax gaps estimated in the $400 billion range, this administration is hard-pressed to come up with new sources of revenues to fill the deficit. It is estimated that will offshore tax abuses cause north america to lose approximately $100 billion annually in tax revenues. Recovering these funds represent excellent portion of the twelve-monthly U. S. tax space, which is why Leader Obama has authorized an additional $128 million for the 2010 IRS budget, which include the addition of 800 new IRS agents. Try not to be fooled, they have declared war upon you and are coming after Your money. <br /><br />First, they are chasing after the companies you help because they see companies operating abroad for a viable source of even more revenues. Currently, companies using overseas operations pay U. S. taxes only if they bring the profits back to north america. They can defer paying U. S. taxes indefinitely once they keep the profits ocean going. Obama's plan, which would take effect in 2011, cracks down on these loopholes so that companies would no longer generate off domestic expenses for generating profits abroad. It is estimated that this change alone would generate $210 billion in new taxes in the next 10 years, creating a modest dent in that forecasted $1. 8 trillion national deficit. Rest assured, this administration will encourage any possible avenue so as to bring these monies back up the U. S. <br /><br />And, they can be coming after YOU. The recently released IRS report in the 2006 tax year indicates that the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion might be another modest source for helping to fill the tax gap. In tax year 2006, approximately U. S. taxpayers residing abroad reported approximately $36. 7 billion in foreign-earned income and claimed nearly $18. 4 billion in income exeptions. And that was three years ago. There are more Us citizens living and working abroad now than ever. Can't you just start to see the wheels turning in the minds of our government leaders? Removing that Foreign Earned Income Exemption could add billions to help U. S. <br /><br />Copyright (c) 2009 Nick Hodges<br />.<br /><br />[url=]Guide to Expatriate Taxation in Thailand[/url]
