<br /><br />the &quot;another capital city&quot; of &quot;China&quot;;
<br /><br />Chinese People call my home is &quot;Little Beijing&quot;.......
<br /><br />Chinese han language prounciation we call &quot;Alxa&quot; is A la shan,a special ,clean, mystery,sacred,strange,ertile Land to visit!As fontier between China&amp;Mongolia,Alxa is very important&quot;thoroughfare of trade&quot;.In the eyes of this world,most of people don't know this &quot;secret&quot;,because it is an&quot;unknown&quot;. The distant,small town......Ba yan hot is the&quot;capital&quot; city of my Alxa where my family&amp;my Mongolian Culture is breathing so!!!
<br /><br />2.6 million of people around my&quot;little Beijing&quot;,guess! how many Chinese yellow-han people are polluting our land?I've never done survey before, but ,as for my lovely-land the truth of history always knock at the gate of my brain and my heart;and moaning to the God &quot;Please..please..please the God clean&amp;blow the dust of the ideal world, because the history, the time,the truth, the earth, the world, the nature, the animals are shedding tears; driping blood in heart, begging the wish of life, joinging a life -and-death struggle......&quot;  Yes! God knows it! Yes!. God is really crying so sad when the true story is telling. You listen carefully, Please! Can you hear the voice of God? He already touched your broken heart and your weak body, soul; Give you Power and Rights to punish the Evil; Give you eyes of wisdom to burn up the eyes of Evil!!! just close your eyes and trying to touch, feel, taste, smell, see, listen to the ugly soul, stink flesh under that mask---China. Yes! we so study the world &quot;Evil&quot; from the time, the truth, the history almost&quot; 5000&quot; years! Evil for this end of Today, it has no brain, no human nature, no truth,  Evil wearing  the Peaceful mask, call itself is most beautiful, friendly,kindhearted, trustworthy, understanding some animal! Evil starts the dirty World War III with no weapon; Evil grows their seeds&amp;&quot;piss around the whole world&quot;! Evil the president is shaking blooded-hand with our upright the pure animals! and shouting &quot;We want Peace&quot;! Evil the ugly animals are over population so billion! just like the dirty virus quietly spreading, very dangerous, stealthy; You can't touch their&quot; weapon&quot;; You can't smell the gunpowder of their war; You have no chance to take shelter from their raid(offensive); Evil is super &quot;Star&quot; in frount of the whole universe, you almost difficult to recognize if yes or no , if good or bad. Thousands years war keep lasting until now the moment of our Y time. Evil keep crying and telling the world, they are &quot;upright&quot;, but killing and insulting our animals, space, time....their more than1.5 billion animals are violating our ideal country's territorial integrity; infringing upon pur human rights ;annexing our other State's territorial, property, money, valuables, space, time, civilization, people. Evil is laughing grin hideously the &quot;stupid/ meaningless war between our own people! Therefore, Upright!!! Let's stop the fighting with our family! Let's start the real war with Evil, because we want the real meaning of Peace&amp;Love;The truely&quot; Animals' Rights&quot;  for ourselves! We must protect our star, save the earth, the ideal country,the highest-grade animals of ours' White-Black-Brown-Yellow--the WBBY family!

What was i doing?Follow through with my beautiful dream?Not sure! Shanghai--The biggest town which is the garbage,pollution,money,so-called smart business men,famous super professional prostitutes,grafters,expensive human nature-market around here and breathing so!
<br />Shall i feel happy with this world of enconemy/financial key district? I've been trying to show off brain to the world, it said&quot;Welcome!&quot; 
<br />I use my fingers and pen to record my IQon a paper----Resume,
<br />Just waiting,sitting,looking for something! Do you think they would hire me?No reply, no answer...but i though i should be the right person for this average position. Then? if no money in my small-space pocket,how can i go on with my life! So? Let me find a part-time work that it could feed my brain! Be super star? Be super model?..etd? Really have no idea on it.
<br /><br />'Just give it try!&quot; someone told me<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> Ok! I gave it chance.
<br />Beautiful outside was shoot &quot;under their dirty business&quot;, I've no choice.
<br />I got pay??? No! No!No! Why? a Korean super man yelled&quot;NO FUK, NO salary!!!&quot; ....I cried,resist; He beat me,raped my soul.. My eyes,tears,blood,pain,palpitation were shouting in midnight. The day time,at least hundreds animals were watching me,even now!!!
<br />I asked the reason why,but they keep playing with my hearing and laughted &quot; Girl,because we hunt you.&quot; ...........................................
<br />LILY:&quot; you hunt me? why hunt me?why am i so crazy words roll off my tongue in public place,subway station,on a street&amp;my bathroom?&quot;
<br />Animals:&quot;Do special job all your life. Decode/Enciphering...and secrets we want the most from your brain!&quot;
<br />Such freaky days for me at that time. No sleeping time at night; No clear--headed at day time. I felt myself like an animal that is from the future,from another planet; I felt myself like a crazy scientist who was teaching the super cuture-----The History,Science,Physics,Chemistry,Mathematics,Literature,Philosophy, Psychology,Astronomy,Geogrephy,living things,Arts,Social problems need deal with, Theology,Physiology,Medical science and so on...Please tell me,who am i? Where am I from? Where am i going? Three months in Shanghai of China, at least 60% of animals knew me very cranky! They took mask, licked the ass of those ugly femal and male.They corrupted my salary(money), they did meat-business&amp;sold their stink bodies in their &quot;Leaders' bed, For what?

<br /><br />What are &quot;Human Rights&quot;&amp;&quot;Civil Rights&quot;? I think it is pretty hard to realize the both of them.because&quot;H*R&quot; is becoming&quot;C*R&quot; and nowadays it's really hard to tell&quot; we have Human Rights or Civil Rights&quot; we are very happy with our life in our country,the reason is because everybody has H*Rs? Well,we definitely shouldn't think so!In China, we have 56 minority groups which means for our Chinese the &quot;Human Rights&quot; are a headache of a problem.just in my English-writing i can say and i would love to show my real feelings about Chinese-H*Rs! Chinese people mention&quot;Law-equality, Unity, Safety, The Developement of economy, The Dignity of the country, The Disparity between the rich and poor&quot; In fact, some part of minorities in China are not satisfied with the Chinese government.The most important thing is because of the &quot;Equality&quot;! If you are &quot;Chinese-Han people&quot;, you could be the &quot;highest-officer&quot;in the Government &quot;department&quot;.but if you are not &quot;Han&quot;, then you might be a &quot;Lower-officer&quot;.hmm...I have many problems that i want to show and yell out, but if i speak too much about &quot;Government&quot; I will lose everything in China-i.e. my Human Rights and Civil Rights. Guess, i have to change the topic,right?..ok!Now, Let's pick up the right time talking about&quot; H*Rs&amp;C*Rs&quot; in developed country--America.$(these following words from one of my best American teachers and friends-Mark who is an awesome writer in Japan).
<br /><br />In the U.S.A, for example: police sometimes torture a suspect to gain confessions and people are punished for years, even though they are innocent, after a prisoner has been released from prison. he or she can't find a job or a place to live. So, even after the &quot;Offical&quot; punishment is finished, the &quot;Social&quot; punishment countinues.
<br /><br />In the old days,in many countries, including China<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />unishment was performed in public and the purpose of punishment was a &quot;Demonstration&quot; to warn people not to break the law. I know some imformation from books that this was gradually stopped in most countries.Although there are still public execution say it is a terrible thing to watch...as a matter of fact, I myself hope i never have to see such a thing! In European-countries,there is no death penalty.More and more countries are stopping it!I think their reason is not connected with&quot;Human Rights&quot;, but rather because these countries have said that all killing is bad and that the government shouldn't become involved in killing people. Instead, letting the prisoner spend the rest of their life, in prison and with no chance of leaving...It's enough punishment!
<br /><br />Then, another issue is about juvenile-crime(by youths). In many cases, young people become bad. One of the reason is because their parents don't give them good guidance, but if you just put them into a prison ,they will be even worse. So prisons become&quot;Fatories&quot; for making criminals instead of &quot;Schools&quot; where bad people are taught to live correctly. Therefore, a young person who breaks the law should be given a chance to re-learn and correct his/her behavior. Of course, some people say that victim has suffered, but making the criminal sufferdoesn't help the victims. It's only taking revenge!&quot;except for the death penalty&quot;-1) is to separate the criminal from society. 2)Make them understand that they did bad things. 3) Teach the prisoners that if they want to be a part of normal society, they can't break the laws.
<br /><br />Recentely in America, the names of sex offenders called &quot;Pedophiles&quot;-(men try to have sex with young children) are made public.(In, China, it is still happening). So, that they can be watched all the time( to prevent them from committing another crime). Unfortuatelly, it seems that these type of men can't be &quot; cured&quot; of their sickness, even punishment does not work as they are unable to control themselves.So...what do you do? and what do about themselves? Well, if this kind of case happens every minute...It's a real problem! &quot;We&quot; should give &quot;Them&quot; the &quot;Human Rights and Civil Rights&quot;??? Should we give them the right to live? I,myself really don't know how to handle it!
<br /><br />In the end, i want to say &quot;Human Rights are not universal and not an essentially western concept!

<br /><br />&quot;To love and to be loved is the greatest happiness of existence.&quot;--Sydney Smith
<br /><br />&quot;Love&quot; the basic word is always used by common people and it is sought from generation to generation...We all want to know where and when we can find the meaning of true love? Have you ever really loved someone before? On Earth, there is a kind of very special emotion growing quietly...... that is love between the same sex( two men or two women).We can call it love without wings,Like this kind of love seems so painful. One of the reason is because love is just allowed to exist between the different sex(male and female).Why? I never thought the &quot;God&quot; stipulates that you couldn't love someone who has the same sex as yours. Why don't we try to understand and stick up for them who are called &quot;Homosexual&quot;, just because they have the same sex? but ,one thing I definitely know that is to love all mankind from the greatest to the lowest; nomatter whether you are male or female,old or young..etd because what people want the most is true love. When true love happens between two men, is it against reason or justice to love eachother positively? Of course, we should respect every person's feelings, but when we are sitting here and just waiting and seeing the love comes to our life.I think,we never know and understand other person's feelings and heart;if you don't know what the passion is,that means you will never know what the true love is! In my mind:&quot;No energy-No reason; No Contraries-No Progression; No attraction-No repulsion; No Love-No hate&quot;, because they are all necessary to human existence.
<br /><br />So, in the end: I would love to say&quot; Love can burn our life; Love can cheer you up; Love can bring you happiness forever!&quot; as i've told you before that the &quot;Love is spring  water in a wilderness&quot;
<br /><br />I hope you would love to read this writing ,because it's all my real thoughts on a greatful movie-Brokeback Mountain.
<br /><br />(Thank you for tasting my words--LilyÉî°Â£©
<br /><br />2) Human Rights&amp;Civil Rights 
<br /><br />What are &quot;Human Rights&quot;&amp;&quot;Civil Rights&quot;? I think it is pretty hard to realize the both of them.because&quot;H*R&quot; is becoming&quot;C*R&quot; and nowadays it's really hard to tell&quot; we have Human Rights or Civil Rights&quot; we are very happy with our life in our country,the reason is because everybody has H*Rs? Well,we definitely shouldn't think so!In China, we have 56 minority groups which means for our Chinese the &quot;Human Rights&quot; are a headache of a problem.just in my English-writing i can say and i would love to show my real feelings about Chinese-H*Rs! Chinese people mention&quot;Law-equality, Unity, Safety, The Developement of economy, The Dignity of the country, The Disparity between the rich and poor&quot; In fact, some part of minorities in China are not satisfied with the Chinese government.The most important thing is because of the &quot;Equality&quot;! If you are &quot;Chinese-Han people&quot;, you could be the &quot;highest-officer&quot;in the Government &quot;department&quot;.but if you are not &quot;Han&quot;, then you might be a &quot;Lower-officer&quot;.hmm...I have many problems that i want to show and yell out, but if i speak too much about &quot;Government&quot; I will lose everything in China-i.e. my Human Rights and Civil Rights. Guess, i have to change the topic,right?..ok!Now, Let's pick up the right time talking about&quot; H*Rs&amp;C*Rs&quot; in developed country--America.$(these following words from one of my best American teacher and friend-Mark who is an awesome writer in Japan).
<br /><br />In the U.S.A, for example: police sometimes torture a suspect to gain confessions and people are punished for years, even though they are innocent, after a prisoner has been released from prison. he or she can't find a job or a place to live. So, even after the &quot;Offical&quot; punishment is finished, the &quot;Social&quot; punishment countinues.
<br /><br />In the old days,in many countries, including China<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />unishment was performed in public and the purpose of punishment was a &quot;Demonstration&quot; to warn people not to break the law. I know some imformation from books that this was gradually stopped in most countries.Although there are still public execution say it is a terrible thing to watch...as a matter of fact, I myself hope i never have to see such a thing! In European-countries,there is no death penalty.More and more countries are stopping it!I think their reason is not connected with&quot;Human Rights&quot;, but rather because these countries have said that all killing is bad and that the government shouldn't become involved in killing people. Instead, letting the prisoner spend the rest of their life, in prison and with no chance of leaving...It's enough punishment!
<br /><br />Then, another issue is about juvenile-crime(by youths). In many cases, young people become bad. One of the reason is because their parents don't give them good guidance, but if you just put them into a prison ,they will be even worse. So prisons become&quot;Fatories&quot; for making criminals instead of &quot;Schools&quot; where bad people are taught to live correctly. Therefore, a young person who breaks the law should be given a chance to re-learn and correct his/her behavior. Of course, some people say that victim has suffered, but making the criminal sufferdoesn't help the victims. It's only taking revenge!&quot;except for the death penalty&quot;-1) is to separate the criminal from society. 2)Make them understand that they did bad things. 3) Teach the prisoners that if they want to be a part of normal society, they can't break the laws.
<br /><br />Recentely in America, the names of sex offenders called &quot;Pedophiles&quot;-(men try to have sex with young children) are made public.(In, China, it is still happening). So, that they can be watched all the time( to prevent them from committing another crime). Unfortuatelly, it seems that these type of men can't be &quot; cured&quot; of their sickness, even punishment does not work as they are unable to control themselves.So...what do you do? and what do about themselves? Well, if this kind of case happens every minute...It's a real problem! &quot;We&quot; should give &quot;Them&quot; the &quot;Human Rights and Civil Rights&quot;??? Should we give them the right to live? I,myself really don't know how to handle it!
<br /><br />In the end, i want to say &quot;Human Rights are not universal and not an essentially western concept!

<br />      Tips 4<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />are to re-evaluate yourself

It can include verbal abuse and constant criticism to more subtle tactics like intimidation, manipulation, and refusal to ever be pleased.
<br />Emotional abuse is like brainwashing in that it systematically wears away at the victim's self-confidence, sense of self-worth, trust in her perceptions, and self-concept. Whether it be by constant berating and belittling, by intimidation, or under the guise of &quot;guidance&quot; or teaching, the results are similar. Eventually, the recipient loses all sense of self and all remnants of personal value. 
<br />Emotional abuse cuts to the very core of a person, creating scars that may be longer-lasting than physical ones. With emotional abuse, the insults, insinuations, criticism and accusations slowly eat away at the victim's self-esteem until she is incapable of judging the situation realistically. She has become so beaten down emotionally that she blames herself for the abuse. Her self-esteem is so low that she clings to the abuser.
<br />Emotional abuse victims can become so convinced that they are worthless that they believe that no one else could want them. They stay in abusive situations because they believe they have nowhere else to go. Their ultimate fear is being all alone.
<br />Following are types of emotional abuse: 
<br />•	DOMINATION: Someone wants to control your every action. They have to have their own way, and will resort to threats to get it. When you allow someone else to dominate you, you can lose respect for yourself.
<br />•	VERBAL ASSAULTS: berating, belittling, criticizing, name calling, screaming, threatening, excessive blaming, and using sarcasm and humiliation. Blowing your flaws out of proportion and making fun of you in front of others. Over time, this type of abuse erodes your sense of self confidence and self-worth.
<br />•	ABUSIVE EXPECTATIONS: The other person places unreasonable demands on you and wants you to put everything else aside to tend to their needs. It could be a demand for constant attention, frequent sex, or a requirement that you spend all your free time with the person. But no matter how much you give, it's never enough. You are subjected to constant criticism, and you are constantly berated because you don't fulfill all this person's needs.
<br />•	EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL: The other person plays on your fear, guilt, compassion, values, or other &quot;hot buttons&quot; to get what they want. This could include threats to end the relationship, the &quot;cold shoulder,&quot; or use other fear tactics to control you.
<br />•	UNPREDICTABLE RESPONSES: Drastic mood changes or sudden emotional outbursts (This is part of the definition of Borderline Personality Disorder). Whenever someone in your life reacts very differently at different times to the same behavior from you, tells you one thing one day and the opposite the next, or likes something you do one day and hates it the next, you are being abused with unpredictable responses. 
<br />This behavior is damaging because it puts you always on edge. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop, and you can never know what's expected of you. You must remain hypervigilant, waiting for the other person's next outburst or change of mood.
<br />An alcoholic or drug abuser is likely to act this way. Living with someone like this is tremendously demanding and anxiety provoking, causing the abused person to feel constantly frightened, unsettled and off balance.
<br />•	GASLIGHTING: The other person may deny that certain events occurred or that certain things were said. You know differently. The other person may deny your perceptions, memory and very sanity. (If a borderline has been disassociating, they may indeed remember reality differently than you do.)
<br />•	CONSTANT CHAOS: The other person may deliberately start arguments and be in constant conflict with others. The person may be &quot;addicted to drama&quot; since it creates excitement. (Many non-BPs also are addicted to drama.) 
<br />Mental, psychological, or emotional abuse can be verbal or nonverbal. Verbal or nonverbal abuse of a spouse or intimate partner consists of more subtle actions or behaviors than physical abuse. While physical abuse might seem worse, the scars of verbal and emotional abuse are deep. Studies show that verbal or nonverbal abuse can be much more emotionally damaging than physical abuse.
<br />Since, in the majority of cases, people who indulge in verbal abuse are selective about whom they abuse, many people are surprised to hear that someone is experiencing on-going and periodic abuse from someone they know and have always seen as nice and friendly. “Nice and Friendly” is the persona of many an abuser. Although many folks are as nice and friendly as they seem, some are not.
<br />Thousands of battered people have said that the hurt of verbal abuse lasted longer than the bruises of physical abuse. Verbal abuse is a kind of violence that creates a deep emotional pain and mental anguish that can be immobilizing.
<br />Verbal abuse is usually hidden. It takes a long time to recover. It is very traumatizing. It can go on for the length of a long relationship without becoming physical. Also, it precedes and is part of physically abusive and threatening relationships--ones where a person is hit, pushed, shoved, or witnesses demonstrations of violence. Verbal abuse is so much like mind control that the victim may doubt her sanity. 
<br />Verbal or nonverbal abuse of a spouse or intimate partner may include:
<br />•	threatening or intimidating to gain compliance 
<br />•	destruction of the victim’s personal property and possessions, or threats to do so 
<br />•	violence to an object (such as a wall or piece of furniture) or pet, in the presence of the intended victim, as a way of instilling fear of further violence 
<br />•	yelling or screaming 
<br />•	name-calling 
<br />•	constant harassment 
<br />•	embarrassing, making fun of, or mocking the victim, either alone within the household, in public, or in front of family or friends 
<br />•	criticizing or diminishing the victim’s accomplishments or goals 
<br />•	not trusting the victim’s decision-making 
<br />•	telling the victim that they are worthless on their own, without the abuser 
<br />•	excessive possessiveness, isolation from friends and family 
<br />•	excessive checking-up on the victim to make sure they are at home or where they said they would be 
<br />•	saying hurtful things while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and using the substance as an excuse to say the hurtful things 
<br />•	blaming the victim for how the abuser acts or feels 
<br />•	making the victim remain on the premises after a fight, or leaving them somewhere else after a fight, just to “teach them a lesson” 
<br />•	making the victim feel that there is no way out of the relationship 
<br /><br />Verbal Abuse and its Devastating Impact
<br />If you've heard, &quot;You're Too Sensitive&quot;, you've probably heard verbal abuse.
<br /><br />The scars from verbal assaults can last for years. They are psychological scars that leave people unsure of themselves, unable to recognize their true value, their talents and sometimes unable to adapt to life’s many challenges. Except for name-calling many people don't recognize verbal abuse—especially when it comes from a person they believe loves them or from a person they perceive as an authority figure; or when it comes from a person who is in a position of power, for example, one's boss, a family provider, one's parent, or even an older sibling that one has learned to look up to in childhood. 
<br /><br />Unfortunately, when people don’t recognize verbal abuse for what it is, they may try to get the person who is putting them down, giving them orders, or “correcting,” denouncing, yelling at or ignoring them to understand them and understand that the behavior hurts them. Or, they may try to stop them by giving it back in kind. In other words, they may act out their anger. 
<br /><br />Since, in the majority of cases, people who indulge in verbal abuse are selective about whom they abuse, many people are surprised to hear that someone is experiencing on-going and periodic abuse from someone they know and have always seen as nice and friendly. “Nice and Friendly” is the persona of many an abuser. Although many people are as nice and friendly as they seem, some are not.
<br />In verbally abusive relationships, verbal abuse creates pain and trauma and can lead to physical illness. Ongoing abuse is stressful, no matter how much one tries to ignore it. Stress compromises the immune system leaving the abused person vulnerable to a host of illnesses. Back pain and exhaustion are often the first symptoms.
<br /><br />On the other hand, people can occasionally feel so upset or frustrated that they say something that is abusive, but when they realize how they’ve come across they apologize and say what they mean in a non-abusive, healthy, way.
<br /><br />If there isn’t a feeling of goodwill and understanding between two people in their relationship, if one is hurting and feeling constantly put down by actual comments, for instance, “You can’t do anything right,” or is frequently yelled at, then that person is probably in a verbally abusive relationship

<br /><br />Ni Hao beloved sister
<br />Very glad to hear you sounding strong and wholesome
<br />Joel and I were very worried from your earlier Emails about bad times in Shanghai
<br />I'm writing you now from North Israel on the border with Syria
<br />Having a very pleasant winter exploring the land of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity with good friends
<br />I've missed good Mongolian company for some time and hope one of these years to visit again
<br />Since you mention politics I'll give my oppinion on the crazy matter
<br />the Chinese and US governments are the biggest super powers in the world;  they control the world
<br />Most of the products in the US are made in China
<br />now there are no jobs in the US because everything is made in China and South Asian countries
<br />The US and China depend on eachother; now one economy cannot exist without the other
<br />The same corporations control the US and China; they are controlled by the same evil people
<br />They pollute the Earth and enslave the people
<br />the US exploits the middle east for oil resources
<br />China exploits North Africa for oil resources; namely Darfur Sudan where China Petrol has funded genocide for many years
<br />the invasion of Tibet was the Chairman Mao's wicked desicion to destroy a good people
<br />I have spent a lot of time in Nepal and India with the Tibetan Buddhists and strongly support the Tibetan cause
<br />Sex, drugs, money, and various types of phony idolatry are all aspects of brain washing
<br />They are propaganda used by the governments to enslave the people with bad images while destroying the good images of humanity
<br />We need more LOVE, more UNITY, more TRUTH, and more HUMBLE PRAISE TO JAH(God) regardless of nationality, ethnicity, and sexual identity
<br />I wish you the best of life sister Lily Ma
<br />stay true to yourself, love yourself above all things
<br /><br />Love and Light
<br />Guidance and Protection
