This is a design adapted from the large kerchief bags tied at the end of the sticks carried by early railroad hobos or &quot;hobo bums.&quot; When shopping for a hobo bag of your own, look for a slouchy crescent-shaped or rectangular bag with a long strap to sling over your shoulder.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpb2ZmZXIuY29tL3JlcGxpY2EtbW9ub2dyYW0tZW1wcmVpbnRlLWF1ZGFjaWV1c2UtZ20tbTQwNTkyX3AxOTE3Ni5odG1sIy5VRTdWSzY2YWo5bw__" target="_blank">replica monogram empreinte audacieuse gm m40592</a><br /><strong>Here is a list of the hot selling hobo style bags from Lucky Brands:</strong><br />The bags are characteristically large - many 15&amp;#8243; by 10&amp;#8243; - and can hold lots of your stuff, even though many of the popular bags of today are smaller handbags. The larger ones serve as gym bags, business bags, overnight bags, special occasions, infant bags, and excellent school bags for lighter loads. Many women are accused of living out of them by their partners!<br /><br />There are vast materials in the bag's designs, ranging from leather to numerous designer materials. Leather bags have become a popular choice in the design world of today. However, many people refuse to buy real leather citing it originates from the hide of animals, such as lambskin. Real leather bags have a leather scent with their shade darkens over time. Another alternative leather bag for you to look at is the faux leather or vegan leather bag. Imitation leather is a non-animal material, made to look and feel like real leather. Other names for it are leatherette, &quot;pleather&quot; or Naugahyde.
