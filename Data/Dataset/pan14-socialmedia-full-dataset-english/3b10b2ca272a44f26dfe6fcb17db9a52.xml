<br /><br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary!

<br /><br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down!
<br /><br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
<br /><br />Girl : *hugs him*
<br /><br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me.
<br /><br />Girl: Alright, now slow down
<br /><br />Guy: I love you babe
<br /><br />(in the paper the next day):
<br />A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived.
<br /><br />The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.
<br /><br />If u love any one this much re-post this ....and....the love of your life will relize they feel the same .... DONT BREAK THIS . 2morow will be the best day of your life.
<br />However, if u don t post this by at least 1:00 tonight, you will have bad luck in your love life 4 the rest of your life

<br />That sailed the wintery sea;
<br />And the skipper had taken his little daughter,
<br />To bear him company.
<br /><br />Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,
<br />Her cheeks like the dawn of day,
<br />And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,
<br />That ope in the month of May.
<br /><br />The Skipper he stood beside the helm,
<br />His pipe was in his mouth,
<br />And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
<br />The smoke now West, now South.
<br /><br />Then up and spake an old Sailor,
<br />Had sailed the Spanish Main,
<br />&quot;I pray thee, put into yonder port,
<br />for I fear a hurricane.
<br /><br />&quot;Last night the moon had a golden ring,
<br />And to-night no moon we see!&quot;
<br />The skipper, he blew whiff from his pipe,
<br />And a scornful laugh laughed he.
<br /><br />Colder and louder blew the wind,
<br />A gale from the Northeast,
<br />The snow fell hissing in the brine,
<br />And the billows frothed like yeast.
<br /><br />Down came the storm, and smote amain
<br />The vessel in its strength;
<br />She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,
<br />Then leaped her cable's length.
<br /><br />&quot;Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,
<br />And do not tremble so;
<br />For I can weather the roughest gale
<br />That ever wind did blow.&quot;
<br /><br />He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
<br />Against the stinging blast;
<br />He cut a rope from a broken spar,
<br />And bound her to the mast.
<br /><br />&quot;O father! I hear the church bells ring,
<br />Oh, say, what may it be?&quot;
<br />&quot;Tis a fog-bell on a rock bound coast!&quot; --
<br />And he steered for the open sea.
<br /><br />&quot;O father! I hear the sound of guns;
<br />Oh, say, what may it be?&quot;
<br />Some ship in distress, that cannot live
<br />In such an angry sea!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;O father! I see a gleaming light.
<br />Oh say, what may it be?&quot;
<br />But the father answered never a word,
<br />A frozen corpse was he.
<br /><br />Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,
<br />With his face turned to the skies,
<br />The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
<br />On his fixed and glassy eyes.
<br /><br />Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
<br />That saved she might be;
<br />And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,
<br />On the Lake of Galilee.
<br /><br />And fast through the midnight dark and drear,
<br />Through the whistling sleet and snow,
<br />Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept
<br />Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe.
<br /><br />And ever the fitful gusts between
<br />A sound came from the land;
<br />It was the sound of the trampling surf,
<br />On the rocks and hard sea-sand.
<br /><br />The breakers were right beneath her bows,
<br />She drifted a dreary wreck,
<br />And a whooping billow swept the crew
<br />Like icicles from her deck.
<br /><br />She struck where the white and fleecy waves
<br />Looked soft as carded wool,
<br />But the cruel rocks, they gored her side
<br />Like the horns of an angry bull.
<br /><br />Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,
<br />With the masts went by the board;
<br />Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,
<br />Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
<br /><br />At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,
<br />A fisherman stood aghast,
<br />To see the form of a maiden fair,
<br />Lashed close to a drifting mast.
<br /><br />The salt sea was frozen on her breast,
<br />The salt tears in her eyes;
<br />And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,
<br />On the billows fall and rise.
<br /><br />Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,
<br />In the midnight and the snow!
<br />Christ save us all from a death like this,
<br />On the reef of Norman's Woe!

<br />and it didn't it got worse and then in early december late november maddie had a huge family tragity and it killed me to have to watch the 2 most important friends i had go threw such hard times and then due to maddie's problem she had to leave and go live with her dad in missouri and didn't get to come back for good ontil summer.morgan is doing better now shes never bin the same though and it tears me up sometimes because i miss her oldself alot but i'll be okay now shes dating a total asshole that so mean to her and i hate him and oh guess what few months back at the begining of the year he got into a bad car accedent too and she was riped i mean i hurt me so horribly but he lived and got away with 2brokend legs a broken arm and shattered jaw and messed up nose. i only wish i could help her and anyone that these kind of things happed to but i do all i can and i no for a fact thats not enough it may help some but i only wish i had the power to fix it so no one had to go threw this ever. if i ever had to be in her possition back then idk what i would do i mean i put the guys who i love so much in jordans spot and thats where i got that poem haha i hope tony doesn't fine that offening because it wasn't a very good poem but still i just had to get some of this heart ache out it's not healthy to hold it all it and i'm here for anyone that ever needs to say anything or just feels loney and needs someone to talk to i'm here so your not alone i wish everyone could read this so that they would know that. so love like there isn't going to be tomarrow and if you love someone tell them everywaking moment dont hold it in because u'll never know if you wont get to tell them.<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />what do u say.
<br />u can't there isn't anythign you can say and if you dont know that then you say ur sry or ur there for them or it's okay
<br />IT'S NOT OKAY!!! its not and for the person on the receiving end of this conversation i mean they take some comfort in those words and its lets them know you care but the point is that there still sad, and thats what i hate is ppl being so sad...and ya no what i can't do anything i can hug them and tell them that i love them and try to help but i mean honestly when ppl offer me up help when i'm hurt most of the time i push them out and tell them i'm okay and go on and carry it all with with me for so long and i mean later yeah sure why not i'll talk about it and stuff but mean, idk if anyone is getting what i'm saying. i'm not saying you should never try to help someone in pail fuck no lol i mean u can work your ass off and should to make them feel better.what kills me though is prolly the anger that comes with the saddness i mean you say&quot;hey man i'm really sry, and i'm here for you.&quot; and i mean some ppl will thank you for your concern but other will just get angry and i understand both points. i'm not gonna lie when i'm hurt and ppl offer help it makes me feel like i'm hurt and just idk it makes me feel angry that they think i need help and angry for needing help but i also think of thing from there point of veiw and i do thank them for there concern and all but for the most part i dont think they understand whats going on and all and alot of the time they dont but i mean i'll sit and talk to them anyways and idc i freekin explain everthing to them but what i also hate is the gossipers they will walk u to u how r u what happen r u okay blah blah blah if ur one of those ppl shame on u and go to hell because thats shitty putting on an act just to know ppls problems for your own knowlage and to spread everywhere yeah know what if they dont tell you shit and tell you to fuck off u disurve it and personaly the ppl that care and do have concern are the ones that try to shut the gossipers up and i think thats great serriously last year there was a boy in my class and a girl brought up my sisters bf who died and just started talk like she knew what happend and i wanted to jump over my desk and beat the shit out of her i didnt say anything cuz i was affraid i would cry if i did but i can't really say how warm it felt to hear a boy sitting behinde me tell her to shut up and tell her she didn't know anything at all so she needed to stop talking. idk but anyone out there ever get that alone feeling i mean i know lots of ppl do but i'm here ur not alone u can think you r but ur not ur never alone i learned that from a really close friend of mine he told me i was never alone i always had him and god haha yeah i'm here too i am. and i always will be so if ur reading this thinking oh pshh... she doesn't know shit it's all good myfriend think what you like idc tell me what you think, i'll listen to you...
