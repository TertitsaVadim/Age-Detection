The roots of this form of affection can be traced back to primitive times, when mothers fondled their children, much as mothers do today.
<br /><br />Much later, in the sixth century, society apparently accepted the custom of kissing between adults as an expression of their affection. Not surprisingly, France first accepted kissing in courtship, and in amore. There, figure dancing was the rage, and each dance was sealed with a kiss.
<br /><br />The custom of kissing swept from France through Europe to Russia, where Russian nobility loved to ape the French. Eventually, the kiss was incorporated into marriage ceremonies, and today lip-locks couples into sweet matrimony.
<br /><br />The custom of kissing today, as well as in ancient times, serves to show respect, and to pay homage to another. For example, early Romans kissed each other on the mouth or on the eyes to greet one another in a manner they deemed to be a dignified. One Roman emperor even ranked a person's importance by the body part he was allowed to kiss. He allowed important nobles to kiss his lips, less important ones to kiss his hands, and the least important ones to kiss his feet.
<br /><br />In Russia, the highest sign of recognition from the Crown meant a kiss from the Tsar himself. Today, natives of many African tribes pay homage to their Chief by kissing the ground over which he has walked.

<br /><br />“The person who gets the farthest is generally the one who is willing to do and dare. The ‘sure-thing’ boat never gets far from shore.”
<br />–Dale Carnegie
<br /><br />Are you daring to do the impossible?  There should never be a time in your life when you’re not attempting something impossible.  It is the impossible that stretches you and shows you what you can become.
<br /><br />Do and dare, get out of your comfort zone and stretch yourself.  Stretch the amount of work you do, stretch your expectations, and stretch your imagination. 
<br /><br />2. Double Your Failure Rate
<br /><br />“Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. You are thinking of failure as the enemy of success. But it isn’t at all. You can be discouraged by failure or you can learn from it, So go ahead and make mistakes. Make all you can. Because remember that’s where you will find success.”
<br />–Thomas J. Watson
<br /><br />If you want to succeed, you need to fail.  No one succeeds with just a handful of failures.  You won’t be the first person to succeed, after only failing three times.  You need to fail, and fail, and fail; failure is the path to success.  You stumble until you walk.  It is through stumbling that you learn how to succeed.  Your stumbles prepare you for success.
<br /><br />3. Use Your Will
<br />“The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather in a lack of will.”
<br /><br />–Vincent T. Lombardi
<br /><br />Another word for “will” would be “desire.”  To succeed you must desire to succeed more than you desire anything else.  Successful people aren’t stronger than others, and they aren’t necessarily anymore intelligent than others, but they have more desire than others.  They have a burning desire to see their goal realized.  Do you have that same burning desire?  Without desire, you won’t have the motivation to accomplish the goal.
<br /><br />4. You need Determination and Commitment
<br /><br />Desire is the key to motivation, but it’s the determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal – a commitment to excellence – that will enable you to attain the success you seek.”
<br /><br />–Mario Andretti
<br /><br />Are you determined, one person determined will accomplish more than a thousand people who are just interested.  You have to have the determination of a bull dog.  You have to latch on, and refuse to let go.  Desire, determination and commitment will strategically position you to succeed.
<br /><br />5. Excellence is Required
<br />“No one ever attains very eminent success by simply doing what is required of him; it is the amount and excellence of what is over and above the required that determines the greatness of ultimate distinction.”
<br /><br />–Charles Kendall Adams
<br /><br />Are you providing excellent service?  To be the best, you must provide the best service.  You must give your customers what they can’t get from anywhere else.
<br /><br />How good is your service?  Can it be duplicated?  Is it excellent?
<br /><br />6. Vision is Necessary
<br /><br />“The vision that you glorify in your mind, the ideal that you enthrone in your heart – this you will build your life by, and this you will become.”
<br />–James Allen
<br /><br />To succeed, you must ponder success.  Only through pondering success will you create the desire to make success a reality.  You must have a clear vision of what you are about to achieve.  This desire must consume you.  If the desire consumes you, it will one day be realized.
<br /><br />7. Go To Success
<br /><br />“Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.”
<br /><br />–Marva Collins
<br /><br />Success won’t fall in your lap; you have to go after it.  You have to chase it down.  You have to want it more than anything else.  A lazy person won’t succeed, only those who are willing to work; those who are willing to “go to it.”
<br /><br />Are you willing to go to success?  Do you have a clear vision, do you have a burning desire, are you willing to fail, if you are, you are well on your way to success.

Although, at that time he was just a small executive in his company, his future doesn't seemed too bright, they were very happy together.
<br /><br />Until one day,(Readmore) his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back. She also told him that she cannot visualize any future for the both of them, so let's go their own ways there and then... heartbroken, the guy agreed. 
<br /><br />When he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, slogging his body and mind just to make something out of himself. Finally with all these hard work and with the help of friends, this guy had set up his own company...
<br />&quot;You never fail until you stop trying.&quot; he always told himself. &quot;I must make it in life!&quot;
<br />Once upon a time, there was once a guy who was very much in love with this girl.
<br />One rainy day, while this guy was driving, he saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didn't take him long to realize those were his ex-girlfriend's parents. With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury sedan. He wanted them to know that he wasn't the same anymore. He had his own company, car, condo, etc. He had made it in life!
<br /><br />Before the guy can realize, the couple was walking towards a cemetery, and he got out of his car and followed them...and he saw his ex-girlfriend, a photograph of her smiling sweetly as ever at him from her tombstone... and he saw his precious paper cranes in a bottle placed beside her tomb. Her parents saw him. He walked over and asked them why this had happened. They explained, she did not leave for France at all. She was stricken ill with cancer. In her heart, she had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want her illness to be his obstacle ... therefore she had chosen to leave him.
<br /><br />She had wanted her parents to put his paper cranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again he can take some of those back with him. The guy just wept ...the worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them but knowing you can't have them and will never see them again.

<br /><br />Sometimes we know we shouldn't and thats exactly why we do.
<br /><br />Mistakes are sometimes the best memories.
<br /><br />You're born, you die, and in between you make a lot of mistakes.
<br /><br />Every new day is another chance to change your life.
<br /><br />You are my favorite mistake.
<br /><br />The times in life, that seems to be the worst, always turn out for the best!
<br /><br />Live your life without regret, don't be someone who theyll forget.
<br /><br />If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it, its much easier to apologize then it is to get permission.
<br /><br />How come dumb stuff seems so smart while you're doing it.
<br /><br />Good judgment comes from bad experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.
<br /><br />If I don't die the first time most likely I will do it again.
<br /><br />You cannot always wait for the perfect time, sometimes you must dare to jump.
<br /><br />Never regret something that once made you smile.
<br /><br />Yes, the past can hurt but the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it.
<br /><br />You shouldn't regret anything that you say, because it was what you were feeling at the moment.
<br /><br />What I like about experience is that it is such an honest thing.
<br /><br />If I could take it all back I wouldn't. Don't live in regret.
<br /><br />Take chances. Tell the truth. Date someone totally wrong for you. Say no. Spend all your cash! Fall in love. Get to know someone random. Be random. Say I love you. Sing out loud. Laugh at a stupid joke. Cry. Get revenge. Apologize. Tell someone how much they mean to you. Tell the asshole what you feel. Let someone know what theyre missing. Laugh til your stomach hurts. LIVE LIFE!
<br /><br />Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have or could have had. No one waits forever.
<br /><br />So I made a big mistake try to see it once my way.
<br /><br />Can you leave it all behind? Cause you cant go back.
<br /><br />Sometimes the littlest thing in life changes something forever and there will be times when you wish you can go back to how things used to be but you just can't because things have changed so much.
<br /><br />All that stupid fun, all the shit weve done. Where'd the good times go?
<br /><br />Assert your right to make a few mistakes. If people can't accept your imperfections, thats their fault.
<br /><br />When loving someone, never regret what you do, only regret what you don't do.
<br /><br />Then you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it.
<br /><br />You only live once, so do everything twice.
<br /><br />Never regret anything, because at one point you wanted it.
<br /><br />Every wrong decision is in fact a correct decision but taken at a wrong time so my friends don't regret... don't stop... keep walking ahead.
<br /><br />If I could go back in time and fix all the mistakes I made, I wouldn't because it has made me who I am today.
<br /><br />Just because someone messes up once doesn't mean that within time they can't find a way to change for the better.
<br /><br />If you never take chances in life youll miss out on the best things.
<br /><br />I have learned more from my mistakes than from my successes.
<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that sometimes its right to do the wrong thing.
<br /><br />Never regret anything because at some point you wanted it.
<br /><br />There are no mistakes in life, only lessons.
<br /><br />The greatest risk in life is not taking one.
<br /><br />Live with intention. Walk to the edge. Listen hard. Practice wellness. Play with abandon. Laugh. Choose with no regret. Continue to learn. Appreciate you friends. Do what you love. Live as if this is all there is no end.
<br /><br />Chances are so hard to come by and the second one is impossible to find.
<br /><br />You gotta take some chances, you gotta risk losing it all, you gotta close your eyes and leap because it might be worth the fall.
<br /><br />As we grow older, it's not the things we did that we often regret, but the things we didn't do. That's why God created tomorrows for us makes things up.
<br /><br />Never say sorry for something you meant to do.
<br /><br />Just because someone tells you that you can't do something doesn't mean you have to listen.
<br /><br />It isn't the problem along the way that make us or break us. It's how we learn to stand and face them that makes the difference.
<br /><br />Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of a life contains three descriptions: could have, might have, and should have.
<br /><br />Don't be afraid to go after what you want to do, and what you want to be. But don't be afraid to be willing to pay the price.
<br /><br />The greatest joy in life always came from doing what others said that you can't do.
<br /><br />I never regretted telling you I liked you, I only regretted never hearing what you really thought of me.
<br /><br />Sometimes you gotta stop and remember that your not gonna live forever. Be young, thing smart, stay true and just follow your heart.
<br /><br />Half of life is fucking up - the other half is dealing with it.
<br /><br />Somewhere along the course of life, you learn about yourself and realize there should never be regrets, only a lifelong appreciation of the choices you've made.
<br /><br />Out best decisions, the ones that we never regret, come from listening to ourselves.
<br /><br />All in all, I have no regrets. The sun still shines, the sun still sets. The heart forgives, the heart forgets. One more kiss, even though it's come to this. I'll close my eyes and make a wish... hoping you'll remember.
<br /><br />Cling to your imperfections, they are what make you unique.
<br /><br />You ask me about regret? Let me tell you a few things about regret, my darling. There is no end to it. You cannot find the beginning of the chain that brought us from there to here. Should you regret the whole chain, and the air in between, or each link separately, as if you could uncouple them? Do you regret the beginning which ended so badly, or just the ending itself? --- White Oleander
<br /><br />I don't fear your judgment 'cause I already know who I am.
<br /><br />Someone asked me, the other day, that if I could change five things about my life, what would I change? My answer: nothing this is who I am, who I'm meant to be. I love being me; even when I'm feeling crappy and I hate myself I wouldn't change a thing.---punkyfairydude
<br /><br />Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins, and there's no such thing as what might have been, that's a waste of time, it'll drive you out of your mind.--- Tim McGraw
<br /><br />Who am I? I am who I say I am and tomorrow someone else entirely. --- White Oleander
<br /><br />I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue them together again and tell myself that the mending whole was good as new. What is broken is broken - and I'd rather remember it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I lived.
<br /><br />Without pain, there would be no suffering, without suffering we would never learn from our mistakes. To make it right, pain and suffering is the key to all windows, without it, there is no way of life.---Angelina Jolie
<br /><br />I'm not going to apologize for it, cause the truth is I'd do it again.
<br /><br />You have to take the good with the bad, smile with the sad, love what you got, and remember what you had. Always forgive, but never forget, learn from your mistakes, but never regret.
<br /><br />Shake off the &quot;why's&quot; and the &quot;what if's&quot; and rid yourself of confusion. Whatever was - is in the past. Whatever is? That’s what's important. The past is a brief reflection, and the future is yet to be realized.
<br /><br />It's hard to accept, but you can't change the past. You can't go back and manipulate things to the way you wanted them to happen. Because life'd be meaningless and boring and just not worth living. But you can change the future and that's a beautiful thing about life. Yes, you will make mistakes. And yes, you will have bad days - but as long as you let the past go, you'll have such a gorgeous and bright future ahead of you. Knowing that things were meant to happen. Knowing that each day you will learn something so that you keep growing to be a better person. Life is like a rope, twined in all its complexities and yet weaved into one marvelous stream that you have the chance you use something amazing from. So grab hold of it.
<br /><br />Often when you think about something for a long period of time, say jumping out of an airplane, you never end up doing it. Its the spontaneity that makes it worth while.
<br /><br />I am who I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.
<br /><br />Enjoy yourself. These are the good old days you're going to miss in the years ahead.
<br /><br />And I won't look back. And I won't regret. Though hurts like hell. Someday I will forget.
<br /><br />REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.
<br /><br />I only follow my voice inside, if it guides me wrong and I do not win I'll learn from my mistakes and try 2 achieve again ~Tupac
<br /><br />Disobedience, in the eyes of any one who has read history, is man’s original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.
<br />- Oscar Wilde
<br /><br />Accept everything about yourself -- I mean everything, You are you and that is the beginning and the end -- no apologies, no regrets.
<br /><br />Don't Give Up you may be tempted to... but dont give up; when you've misplaced your hopeful dreams, Dare to believe again in the impossible; Catch a ray of sunshine,and hold on tightly; The one who holds your hand... will never let you go.
<br /><br />Believe you can, and you can. Belief is one of the most powerful of all problem dissolvers. When you believe that a difficulty can be overcome, you are more than half way to victory over it already - Norman Vincent Peale 
<br /><br />At times I wish I could change the past...but sometimes the past changes you.
<br /><br />We talk like we know what's going on. But we don't. We don't know anything. We're young and we're gonna screw-up a lot. We're gona keep changing our minds and even sometimes our hearts. And through all that, the only thing we can truly offer eachother is... forgiveness.
<br /><br />Take chances... alot of them. Because honestly, no matter where you end up- and with who, it always ends up just the way it should be. Your mistakes make you who you are... you learn and grow with each choice you make. Everything is worth it. say how you feel- always . Be you, and be okay with it. It doesn't matter what any other person thinks.
<br /><br />Never regret anything that has happened in your life, it cannot be changed, undone or forgotten so take it as a lesson learned and move on 
<br /><br />If you spend your life regretting things in the past, before you know it... you will have wasted your life on regret
<br /><br />I never regret anything that has happened to me in my life, wether it is making a bad choice, deciding to do something I shouldnt have, saying the wrong thing or not doing something I should have done... because all of these things have given me the knowledge I have today and helped make me who I am today... and that is one thing I will never regret.

<br /><br />It's better to cross the line and suffer the consequences than to just stare at that line for the rest of your life.
<br /><br />Concern yourself with not what is right and what is wrong, but with what is important.
<br /><br />The best thing that you can do in life is follow your heart. Take risks. Don't just take the safe and easy choices because your afraid of what might happen. Don't have any regrets and know that everything happens for a reason.
<br /><br />There comes a point when you're more important than your past.
<br /><br />Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.
<br /><br />Mistakes are a part of being human. Appreciate your mistakes for what they are: precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way. Unless it's a fatal mistake, which, at least, others can learn from.
<br /><br />If I had my life to live over... I'd dare to make more mistakes next time.
<br /><br />This isn't good or bad. It's just the way of things. Nothing stays the same.
<br /><br />Regrets are a waste of time. They're the past crippling you in the present.
<br /><br />When you come to the edge of the light that you know, and you are about to step off into the darkness of the unknown, faith is knowing that one of two things will happen: there will be something to land on, or you will learn how to fly.
<br /><br />Please don't blame yourself for any of the stupid shit that I choose to do. None of this is your fault. I'm the one who makes these bad decisions so I'm the one who pays the consequences.--- Jupiter-Girl
<br /><br />The trouble with so many of us is that we underestimate the power of simplicity. We have a tendency it seems to over complicate our lives and forget what's important and what's not. We tend to mistake movement for achievement. We tend to focus on activities instead of results. And as the pace of life continues to race along in the outside world, we forget that we have the power to control our lives regardless of what's going on outside.
<br /><br />If you're not willing to risk it all, then you don't want it bad enough.
<br /><br />More people would learn from their mistakes if they weren't too busy denying them.
<br /><br />If I could relive my life, I wouldn't. Cause everything I've done, I've never once regretted doing them. And everything I am is everything I was meant to be. --- Alice1989
<br /><br />Follow your heart, because if you always trust your mind, you'll always act on logic, and logic doesn't always lead to happiness.
<br /><br />There are two things which prevent us from achieving our dreams. The first is the belief that they are impossible and the second is seeing them made possible by the twist of the wheel of fortune when we least expect it. For at that moment, all our fears rise to the surface: the fear of suddenly setting off along a road heading god knows where, the fear of a life full of new challenges, the fear of losing forever all that is familiar.
<br /><br />Sometimes we need to stop analyzing the past - stop planning the future - stop figuring out precisely how we feel - stop deciding with our mind exactly what we want our heart 
<br />to feel - sometimes we just have to go with the flow.
<br /><br />I'd rather have a life full of mistakes then a heart full of regret.
<br /><br />Still, I'm convinced that wondering 'what if' is the worst thing there is.
<br /><br />If you obey all the rules, you'll miss all the fun. -Katharine Hepburn
<br /><br />When you make a mistake, don't look back at it long. Take the reason of the thing into your mind and then look forward. Mistakes are lessons of wisdom. The past cannot be changed. The future is yet in your power. --- Hugh White
<br /><br />I'd rather live my life to the fullest than conduct myself in a certain way to gain approval from others; I have no regrets and especially no apologies.
<br /><br />I've been thinking a lot lately about taking chances. And how it's really just about overcoming your fears. Because the truth is, every time you take a big risk in your life, no matter how it ends up, you're always glad you took it. ~ Scrubs
<br /><br />Sometimes we need to stop analyzing the past, 
<br />stop planning the future, stop figuring out precisely 
<br />how we feel, stop deciding with our minds exactly 
<br />what we want our hearts to feel, sometimes we 
<br />just have to go with the flow and just enjoy life.
<br /><br />I would rather do something and find out that it was the wrong thing, than never know if it was the right thing.
<br /><br />It's hard to take chances but sometimes it's better if you do.
<br /><br />Life is not about what I've done, what I should've done, what I could've done... it's about what I can do and what I will do
<br /><br />Every passing moment is a chance to turn it all around.
<br /><br />You know, things happen to you, and sometimes you don't realize why it happened until much later. But eventually it all makes sense.
<br /><br />Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the one's you did. Explore, dream, discover.
<br /><br />Experience is the worst teacher; it gives the test before presenting the lesson...
<br /><br />Things don't happen for no reason, they happen to teach you something.
<br /><br />Don't put a period where God put a comma.
