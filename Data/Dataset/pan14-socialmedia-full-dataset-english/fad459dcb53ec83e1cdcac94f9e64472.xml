At that time, he did not think he would set foot on the collection of antique wine this way. Today, the value of his collection of six million euros (about $ 790,000).
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bralph"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ralph</a> lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Van der Bonthe collections, the most valuable was undoubtedly a bottle of cognac. It is the world's most expensive bottle of cognac, valued at € 138,000 ($ 182,000) in 1795, had followed the army of Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Europe by the British Grand Cognac brewing. It is unique also is that the bottle is artificial blowing six liters bottle. Van der Bonthe 1990 from Christie's auction is an auction and bought this bottle of wine. He said it may be the world's last batch of such brandy.

<br />Van der Bonthe, aged 63 years. The early 1970s, he opened a small antique shop, so often to France's second-hand goods shops, Taobao. &quot;Many times, those who shop the sale of cognac or brandy Ya-eup, I decided to buy some.&quot;
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />In 1978, Van der the Bonthe's father donated his approximately 100 bottles of vintage wine, his collections explosion. His father, who operates a gardening service enterprises, wealthy clients often send his wine as a gift.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;h<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BGHD%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;GHD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />&quot;My father said to me, 'You collection of liquor absent-minded, why not for other investments?&quot; Said van de Bont recalled, &quot;but I have not heard&quot; these wine collection is very time-consuming, and costly, but this is me the best investment. &quot;he said.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BLisseur"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisseur</a> Ghd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />The past few decades, the van der Bonthe collection of over 5,000 bottles of rare vintage wine, most of them the French cognac and Ya-eup, brandy, port wine, Madeira, white wine, rum, etc..This wine is considered to be the largest wine collectors the world. Van der Bonthe store them in their own farms of the southern Dutch city of Breda suburbs transformed the bullpen, there is quite safe.

The researchers concluded that the previous ocean acidification, the main factor is the &quot;act of God&quot;, there is now a &quot;man-made.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bralph"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ralph</a> lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />21 researchers in the United States, Britain, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands carried out this subject, and the results published by the U.S. &quot;Science&quot; magazine.
<br /><br />Analysis of geological and climate data, these researchers found that the offset of the 20th century, ocean pH values to acidic 0.1, to predict the offset of this century, 0.2 or 0.3.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bpolo"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;polo</a> ralph lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />The past 300 million years, about 56 million years ago, the Paleocene - Eocene extremely warm period (PETM) last 5,000 years, acidification speed now the closest; acidity values to acidic offset about 0.4, an average of every century offset 0.008.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />Study of one of Columbia University, Lamont - Doherty Geological Observatory Station ancient oceanographer Babel Honeywell facilities to accept the Reuters correspondent in a telephone interview, said that the Paleocene - Eocene period of very warm, global warming fast, the sea quickly acidification, but it can be said to pale into insignificance compared with the period after the Industrial Revolution.
<br /><br />The increase in seawater acidity can be deadly coral, coral reef habitat of many marine animals and plants. In addition, the acidic affect shellfish and shrimp shell formation.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;h<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BGHD%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;GHD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />The report said, a very warm period, a variety of coral and single-celled marine life extinction, a variety of plant or animal food chain may then disappear.
<br /><br />The researchers investigated object to the brown mud layer near Antarctica in the Southern Ocean seabed between plankton fossils, that the 5,000 years of a very warm period of seawater acidity that plankton fossils corrosion sludge.
<br /><br />Seawater to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, carbon increase resulting in acidification exacerbated. The carbon dioxide is also one of the main factors that contribute to climate warming.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BLisseur"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisseur</a> Ghd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Researchers determined that, four times the mass extermination of the Earth's biological history of the period accompanied by carbon, the temperature rise of 6 ° C and seawater sour at this stage of acidification may be more severe than those periods.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.lisseurghdfrance.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />The researchers speculate that the previous ocean acidification may be due to volcanic activity or asteroid impact, resulting in a dramatic rise in the concentration of atmospheric carbon. And now, the main acidification factors of industrial emissions.
<br /><br />Very warm period 5000 years, atmospheric carbon concentration is doubled, the average temperature rise of 6 ° C. The early Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, the use of fossil fuels and other human activities, carbon concentration increased from about 280ppm to 392ppm. ppm concentration units of measurement, 1ppm for the millionth. Study Group of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that this century the earth's temperature could rise by 1.8 ° C to 4 ° C.
<br /><br />&quot;We understand that earlier in the event of marine acidification biological did not become extinct because of biological evolution, the new biological instead of biological extinction. Honeywell Shi explained,&quot; However, if the industrial carbon emissions continue at its current pace, we may lose like biological , such as coral, oysters and salmon.

<br />The parasites multiply rapidly in the Mediterranean region, some areas almost half of the fish were infected with the researchers named &quot;Betty&quot;. Betty 'homely, indeed reminiscent of those alien movies, but &quot;Betty&quot; harmless to humans, but it will hinder the normal growth of the fish, shortened life expectancy. Gills from juvenile swim into the fish head, housed in the top of the tongue, and blood for food.

<br />The analysis showed that &quot;Betty&quot; in the fish, are overfishing the waters of rapid propagation. A nearby protected areas in Spain, nearly 30% of fish infected with such parasites, while in Italy, the waters of overfishing, 47 percent of the fish has become a victim of the parasite. The researchers also found that the greater the impact of parasites on the fish in areas overfishing: parasite infection a serious impediment to the growth of the Italian waters of fish, but no apparent effect on the physiology of the Spanish sea bream.

Things are not large, but in the context of the British Government to continue to weaken expenditure, he has intimate contacts with the rich and somewhat not withstand scrutiny. To this end, Cameron attend the EU summit of the will take the initiative to the media, admitted the fact, hoping to defuse the controversy on the use of 2 pm local time.

<br />After disclosure of the media, the British Police - Scotland Yard confirmed recently before they really lend an already &quot;retired&quot; police horse &quot;Leisha&quot; to Brooks, and stressed that this is not a gift given to her. Brooks not the others, she was the News of the World &quot;and the tabloid&quot; The Sun &quot;editor in chief, once one of the two newspaper behind the boss of Murdoch's most important aides, resigned after the scandal broke, and was arrested.

<br /><br />He said: &quot;In fact, since after the election (May 2010), we are no together to ride a horse. Before the election, yes, I did have with him riding, he has a lot of horse, which one is Police Ma Leisha.

Swiss researchers found that chimpanzee populations have a similar role of the police to act as a third-party mediation, to deal with internal conflicts, and to maintain group stability.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bralph"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ralph</a> lauren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Arbitration
<br /><br />This phenomenon has long been documented, but only as anecdotes, there is no clear evidence. Carel van Schaik, University of Zurich, Switzerland anthropologist Claude Claudia von Rohr, under the auspices of, the researchers found that the police maintain law and order in the chimpanzee groups.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />The researchers observed and compared the four groups controlled chimpanzee behavior, Walter Zoo in Gauchot found special circumstances. Sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science EurekAlert website quoted von Rohr as saying: &quot;We are fortunate to observe a chimpanzee groups change, new entrants to the number of female chimpanzees, male chimpanzees level position to redraw the group stability is shaken. This also occurs in wild chimpanzee populations. &quot;
<br /><br />They found that a number of members involved in disputes when the chimpanzee groups, the arbiter of fair interfere with the wishes of the most strongly. Perhaps because such disputes are more likely to endanger the groups stability.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polo-ralphlaurens.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bpolo"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.polo-ralphlaurens.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;polo</a> ralph laurens&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Mediate
<br /><br />The researchers published in a Public Library of Science Volume, finds that the conflict is not between the members of the chimpanzee mediation groups for their own direct interests, but to maintain peace and stability groups.
<br /><br />Like humans, chimpanzees in the power structure. The researchers found that each is not a chimpanzee can be qualified for arbitration duties, mainly by high-status male or female chimpanzee or chimpanzee is widely respected in the group play, or the arbitrator can not resolve contradictions.
<br /><br />The researchers believe that the mediation group of chimpanzees &quot;police&quot; internal contradictions can be regarded as an early form of morality in the evolutionary process.
<br /><br />Von Rohr said: &quot;society's interest in the development of our human society, and constitute the basis for morality. This interest deeply rooted in our closest relatives, who can be found.&quot;
<br /><br />Moral
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;h<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BGHD%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;GHD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />Previous studies have shown that mammals may constrain their own behavior to moral standards, like humans.
<br /><br />Marc Bekoff, professor of the University of Colorado, ecologists in the book, Wild Justice, &quot;for example, chimpanzees have a sense of justice with punishment in violation of the rules of the companion, given the disability companion special care.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3BLisseur"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisseur</a> Ghd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
<br />University of Oxford researchers observed that the elephant will not only companionship, care for injured or sick companion, but also other animals show sympathy. South Africa in 2003 for an elephant release the iron latch, open the sheepfold entrance to help the antelope escape.
<br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bb%26gt%3Bwww.lisseurghdfrance.net%26lt%3B%2Fb%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisseurghdfrance.net&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.lisseurghdfrance.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt</a>;
<br />Some studies of animals the extent to which the complex emotional and social responsibility are skeptical, but admit is difficult to identify animals completely the quality of human morality.
