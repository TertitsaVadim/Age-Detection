<br /><br />The truth is that it began as a way to keep the 5 year old little brother occupied between the start of big sister's dance class and the end of her class. Because the front door of the TKD studio was literally four doors down from the front door of the dance studio it seemed like a good enough idea. We had no clue at the time that it would end up being the very best thing we could ever have done for our son.
<br /><br />As any parent knows, each child develops at a different rate and all children face their own special challenges. Some 5-year-olds can read but can't hit a ball off the &quot;T&quot; to save themselves. Others can already ride a bicycle without training wheels but may not yet know their colors. You know what I mean. As a parent, the hope and the challenge is to coax improvement in the areas which are lacking so as to give them every advantage.
<br /><br />Rob's special challenge was physical which is now hard to believe when you see him do a 360 twist kick. By this I mean that he literally had no idea where his body was and had little control of it. Later we learned that the medical term for this is Sensory Integration Dysfunction. Contributing to this was another condition called Strabismus which is often referred to as &quot;lazy eye&quot; for which he eventually had corrective eye surgery. When he was a little guy and I got my final kiss good-night I routinely held up my arm in a blocking maneuver to protect myself from the head-butt which was sure to come because he was unable to accurately judge how much force was required to move his body a given distance. As he got older we used to tease him that we had &quot;charmed&quot; the floor in the kitchen (this was back when Harry Potter was all the rage) because it seemed as though every time he walked across it he would fall down. Often he would simply fall off his chair at the dinner table, sitting still was an impossibility.
<br /><br />Peer pressure can work for you or against you. When he saw that his classmates could stand still in a straight line he learned that he could exercise self-control too. When all his classmates were advancing to a higher rank he wanted to advance too and he learned that hard work and perseverance are rewarded. The constant and repetitive physical and mental demands of learning Forms and Sparring were exactly what he needed. Taekwondo is a snap shot of all the honorable aspects of life included all within a 45 minute class. Sometimes you succeed and sometimes you fail, but your personal integrity is what matters most. Did you try your hardest and do your best? Only you will know. Do you have the spirit to try it again? We have experienced the thrill of breaking the last board on the last try and advancing to the next belt level and we have experienced the utter agony of no-change. 
<br /><br />My little guy is now almost as tall as I am and about to become a high school freshman. He is a good student and a hard worker, and he is a confident and courteous young man. Reality is that his opportunity to experience negative peer pressure is about to go up by a factor of a hundred, but I am extremely confident that he has the tools and the training to make the right choices thanks in no small part to Ms. Peck and all that she has taught on the way to developing a 3rd degree black belt and a junior instructor following the guidelines of Taekwondo America. His mother and I are very proud.

Traction in one form or another has been employed for centuries to achieve just that.</strong></em>
<br /><br />As a back specialist I'm asked this question almost weekly, or &quot;right regular&quot; as they say in the country parts of North Carolina, and I'll answer the question directly in just a few moments, but first let me point out that the same question could be asked about innumerable other things: What about a vibrating thing for your special chair? What about heat or ice? Or magnets? Or meditation? Or an expensive bed? Maybe a massage would help? Perhaps a hot tub? A cane and eventually a walker may be of some benefit too. There are all sorts of back braces available. The list goes on. Now, don't get me wrong, I understand that life can be stressful. And I like a good soak in the hot tub as much as the next person, and a quality bed may help prevent back problems down the road, but if you're hoping that thing you saw on TV for 3 easy payments of $69.95 is going to fix your back - it probably won't.
<br /><br />First, let me applaud you for still searching for an answer for surely doing nothing won't  work. Second, the fact that you are still searching is telling, and what it tells me is that something is wrong with your back. So, will an inversion table help? Yes, it probably will at least for a while in the same way that if your car were overheating on hot days you could simply open the hood every morning before leaving for work and add a half a gallon of water to the radiator. So long as it doesn't get too hot and you don't drive too far you should be able to make it through the day. Sounds crazy though doesn't it? How long would it take you to figure out that something must be wrong with your car? Do you really want to take a chance on being stranded on the side of the road?
<br /><br /><strong>What Could Be Wrong With Your Back?</strong>
<br />Degenerative Disc Disease is a common cause of what is wrong with backs and necks. As a spinal disc degenerates the side walls first get drier and weaker and consequently begin to bulge taking up space and putting pressure on (or pinching) the spinal nerve root. In the early stages this bulge can come and go somewhat dependent upon what you did or didn't do yesterday explaining why your symptoms come and go. Second, as it gets drier and drier it gradually loses height and the vertebrae get closer together further compromising the space for the nerve and exaggerating the effect of the bulge. At this stage the symptoms tend to be more frequent and more severe. Third, the resulting stress on the joint causes a gradual calcium buildup much in the same way that stress on the skin of your hand results in a gradual buildup of skin. In the case of skin this buildup is called a callous and in the case of bone this buildup is called bone spurs or arthritis. The build up of bone further narrows the space for the nerve roots. At this stage the symptoms can be nearly constant. The effects of degeneration have culminated in a narrowing of the channel for the nerve root which is referred to as spinal stenosis. 
<br /><br /><strong>Gravity Causes Stress On Your Spine</strong>
<br />An inversion table counters the effect of gravity. When you hang upside down the weight of your upper body separates the vertebra temporarily increasing the space between them to possibly relieve enough pressure on the nerve to make it feel better. Temporarily. The trouble is that the disease remains, the disc is still degenerated.
<br /><br />There are many problems with inversion. Depending upon your body weight there may be way too much pressure being applied to the weakened disc fibers which runs the risk of tearing them further or there may not be enough force being applied to the right place at the right angle to actually result in any benefit. There is simply no way to measure the force or change the angle. Further, hanging upside down is at best uncomfortable as the blood rushes to your head. A minute of this seems like a very long time. Those with heart or blood pressure issues and those with certain eye conditions must be specially wary. Depending upon the design of the particular inversion table it is likely that a slant position can be accomplished as opposed to being completely upside down which may make it easier to tolerate for a longer time but again there is no way to adequately determine the pressure being applied to the offending disc. In any event, it is doubtful that even several minutes is long enough to effect any lasting change in the physiology of a damaged disc. Additionally, most designs require at least some degree of athleticism to actually flip your body upside down prohibiting those who are the most desperate for relief from even trying.
<br /><br />Attempts to counter the effects of gravity to relieve back pain and neck pain is not new. Traction in one form or another has been employed for centuries to achieve just that. Unfortunately, traction whether done mechanically or by inversion is too little, too late. Spinal Decompression Therapy, however, is a non-invasive, non-surgical treatment performed on a special, computer controlled table similar in some ways to an ordinary traction table, but singularly different because it targets a single disc level and utilizes specific traction and relaxation cycles (a pumping action) throughout the 20-30 minute treatment. This, along with proper angle or positioning, creates a negative pressure within the disc. It works by gently separating the offending disc 5 to 7 millimeters creating a negative pressure (or a vacuum) inside the disc promoting the retraction of the bulging disc tissue. It actually &quot;sucks in&quot; the bulging disc material. The pumping action also circulates water, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the disc, thereby re-hydrating a degenerated disc and bringing in the nutrients needed to begin the healing process. This will in many cases also restore at least some of the lost disc height.

That information is stored in our genes. The secret lies in being able to instruct cells regarding the implementation of that information. Protandim does just that.</strong></em>
<br /><br />Your body receives a constant supply of oxygen as you breathe and your cells use that oxygen in various chemical reactions along with the vitamins and minerals, and the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates consumed in the foods you eat, to produce energy and keep you healthy. As a consequence of this metabolic activity, highly reactive molecules are produced known as free radicals. Free radicals can be thought of as similar in many ways to the exhaust from your automobile; that is, the energy released from the combustion of gasoline and oxygen is desirable, but the resultant exhaust is toxic and harmful. 
<br /><br />A free radical is a molecule missing an electron and it will strip an electron from another molecule to become &quot;whole&quot;. This damages that molecule which in turn becomes a free radical beginning a chain reaction. Once the process is started it escalates throughout a lifetime and is thought to be one of the primary determinates of aging. Damage enough molecules and you damage the cell, damage enough cells and you damage the tissue or organ system. Damage to tissue in excess of the body's ability to repair that damage is called disease. All antioxidants neutralize free radicals by donating one of their own electrons ending the &quot;electron-stealing&quot; reaction. The antioxidants themselves don't become free radicals when they donate an electron because they are stable in either form. 
<br /><br />All aerobic organisms (those that require oxygen for life), including mankind, produce this harmful &quot;exhaust&quot; as a result of normal cellular metabolism as described above and have evolved to handle and dispose of it. But, if the antioxidants needed for this process are unavailable, or if free-radical exposure becomes excessive, damage occurs. In our modern society there is both less availability of antioxidants due to the diminishing quality of our food sources, and more exposure to free-radicals due to increasing pollutants in our environment. Many of the foods past generations relied upon to supply naturally occurring antioxidants have been processed and now contain preservatives, and have been canned, frozen, or micro-waved negating much of their antioxidant properties. Worse, much of what we consume has been exposed to herbicides and pesticides which far from reducing oxidative stress actually contributes to it. These same herbicides and pesticides contaminate our ground water as well. Environmental pollutants found in our air and water such as emissions from automobiles and industries, radiation, asbestos, and many others all contribute to the production of free radicals. Smoking, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals also contribute to the production of free radicals. Thus, this society is exposed to more free radicals than any before in the history of man. 
<br /><br />Oxidative damage and chronic inflammation has been implicated in the cause of many diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome, Sickle Cell Disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and others. It has, as well, an impact on the body's aging process. It is no small matter.

<br /><br /><strong>What Can You Do?</strong>
<br /><br />Diet is, of course, an important consideration.
<br /><br />Berries — Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and cranberries are among the top sources of antioxidants.
<br /><br />Beans — Small red beans and kidney, pinto and black beans are all choices rich in antioxidants.
<br /><br />Fruits — Many apple varieties (with peel) are high in antioxidants, as are avocados, cherries, green and red pears, fresh or dried plums, pineapple, kiwi and others.
<br /><br />Vegetables — Those with the highest antioxidant content include artichokes, spinach, red cabbage, red and white potatoes (with peel), sweet potatoes and broccoli. Although the effect of cooking on antioxidant levels varies by cooking method and vegetable, one study showed that cooking generally increased levels among select vegetables.
<br /><br />Beverages — Green tea may come to mind as a good source of antioxidants, but other beverages have high levels, too, including coffee, red wine and many fruit juices such as pomegranate.
<br /><br />Nuts — Walnuts, pistachios, pecans, hazelnuts and almonds are some of the top nuts for antioxidant content.
<br /><br />Herbs — These may be unexpected suppliers of antioxidants, but ground cloves, cinnamon and ginger, dried oregano leaf and turmeric powder are all good sources.
<br /><br />Grains — In general, oat-based products are higher in antioxidants than are those derived from other grain sources.
<br /><br />And for dessert — A piece of dark chocolate ranks as high or higher than most fruits and vegetables in terms of antioxidant content.

<br /><br /><strong>How Does Protandim Help?</strong>
<br />Vitamins C and E are thought to protect the body against the destructive effects of free-radicals too. The trouble is that one such antioxidant molecule from whatever source can neutralize only a few free-radical molecules before it is depleted. In our modern society, a good diet alone is simply no longer enough. The most effective way to fight free radicals and reverse the spread of oxidative stress and the chronic inflammation they cause is to trigger the body to produce its own free-radical fighting enzymes. That information is stored in our genes. Protandim is specially formulated to induce cells to produce more of these genetically encoded catalytic defense enzymes which have been named Superoxide Dismutases (SOD). Every enzyme molecule produced by this approach can eliminate up to 1 million free radicals before being depleted. When the protein messenger (Nrf2) is activated, it enters the nucleus of the cell and turns on hundreds of the body’s survival genes that code for these enzymes. These genes enable cells to survive in the face of several different kinds of stress, especially oxidative stress. Nrf2 also affects hundreds of other genes, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, by turning them down.
<br /><br />Thus, Protandim is a master regulator of the aging process and an Nrf2 synergizer which activates survival genes, including antioxidant genes, that keep us safe from free radicals and oxidants and their harmful effects. It also turns down genes that perpetuate inflammation, and genes that encourage slow, progressive fibrosis to take place. Together these actions provide a remarkable promise of protection from many kinds of age-related health conditions.
<br /><br /><strong>Protandim was developed by Joe McCord, Ph.D. </strong>
<br />Dr. McCord holds a B.S. in Chemistry from Rhodes College (graduated 1966) and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Duke University (graduated 1970), where he also conducted postdoctoral research. Dr. McCord has held biochemistry faculty positions at Duke University Medical Center and University of South Alabama. He currently serves as a professor in the department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Genetics at the University of Colorado Denver. He has received several awards and honors for his research and discoveries in the field of free radical biochemistry, is a past recipient of the Elliott Cresson Medal, the Discovery Award from the Society for Free Radical Biology and Medicine (SFRBM), and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Oxygen Society. He has been a member of the board of directors of the LifeVantage Corporation (makers of the dietary supplement Protandim) since 2006. 
<br /><br /><strong>More Information</strong>
<br />The battle between those with a vested interest in the status quo and those who advocate non-pharmacological solutions to the health ailments of man will continue to rage. What is certain, however, is that LifeVantage Corporation has recently been granted a fourth patent for its flagship product Protandim® from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It is further certain that the U.S. government-funded National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), whose mission is to develop new information technologies to aid in the understanding of fundamental molecular and genetic processes that control health and disease has published twelve (12) research articles on PubMed,  a service of the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, and that many more studies are currently being conducted by several major universities. In addition, a Primetime Live Investigative Report by ABC News which aired in 2005 found scientific merit to the claims.

Often, surgery is offered as an ultimately desperate last measure, but almost always it is unjustifiable and usually fails to provide permanent relief; the other choice was &quot;learn to live with it&quot;.</strong></em>
<br /><br />Spinal Decompression Therapy, first approved by the FDA in 2001, has since evolved into a cost-effective treatment for herniated and degenerative spinal discs; one of the major causes of back pain. It works on the affected spinal segment by significantly reducing intradiscal pressures. This is a conservative procedure for patients suffering with bulging or herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome, sciatica, failed back surgery syndrome, and non-specified mechanical low back or neck pain.
<br /><br />Millions of Americans suffer from severe back and neck pain as a result Degenerative Disc Disease. DDD as it is often referred to in the literature is not really a &quot;disease&quot; in the common sense of the word, but rather a term used to describe a process or condition that develops gradually and worsens over time. Use of this term indicates that the cartilage-like discs between the spinal vertebral joints are the primary cause of the symptoms, and that the degenerative changes are rather advanced. To some degree intervertebral discs lose their flexibility, elasticity, and shock absorbing characteristics as we age as do the other tissues in the body. Abnormal or excessive mechanical stresses or injuries of the past coupled with hereditary, developmental, and metabolic influences can rapidly accelerate this process.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
<br />As the involved disc dries out and loses height (a process known as desiccation) it causes the vertebra to become closer together narrowing the channels through which the nerve roots pass. A dry, hard disc can absorb less shock and is thus more easily torn resulting in a greater likelihood of herniation or bulge further compressing or pinching the nerves. As the stress on the joint compounds and osteoarthritis begins to result, bone spurs form and ligaments thicken (hypertrophy) gradually narrowing the nerve channels even further. These factors in various combinations and degrees of severity compromise the space in the nerve channels, a condition known as spinal stenosis (narrowing), and conspire to compress (pinch) the nerves.
<br /><br /><strong>Symptoms of Degenerative Disc Disease</strong>
<br />The most common symptom of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine is low back pain (lumbalgia). If the cervical spine is affected, the most common symptom is neck pain (cervicalgia). When degenerative disc disease causes compression of the cervical nerve roots there may be shoulder pain, arm pain, and pain in the hand/fingers (neuritis, neuralgia, radiculitis), and may be associated with numbness and tingling (paresthesia). When degenerative disc disease causes compression of the lumbar nerve roots there may be butt pain, hip pain, leg pain, and pain in the foot/toes. This often is accompanied by muscle weakness in either the arm or leg.
<br /><br /><strong>Spinal Decompression Treatment</strong>
<br />In the past, a patient suffering from disc problems was usually given pain medications or injections, instructed to refrain from physical activities, referred for physical therapy, and when they weren't progressing they were sent for spinal surgery or simply told to learn to live it. Since 2001 when the FDA finally approved non-surgical spinal decompression therapy, there is new hope for those who suffer from degenerative disc disease. Spinal Decompression Therapy is a non-invasive, non-surgical treatment performed on a special, computer controlled table similar in some ways to an ordinary traction table. A single disc level is isolated and by utilizing specific traction and relaxation cycles throughout the treatment, along with proper positioning, negative pressure can actually be created within the disc. It works by gently separating the offending disc 5 to 7 millimeters creating negative pressure (or a vacuum) inside the disc to pull water, oxygen, and nutrients into the disc, thereby re-hydrating a degenerated disc and bringing in the nutrients needed to heal the torn fibers and halt the degenerative process. As the disc is re-hydrated the shock absorbing properties are restored and a normal life can be resumed.

		<document id="fb797ca19d73a62fde22c7a1271fa648" url=""><![CDATA[Risks of Epidural Steroid Injections<br/><br/><strong>Modern medical science has finally developed an effective alternative to endless injections or simply living with the pain - Spinal Decompression Therapy.</strong><em></em>
<br /><br />Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a common treatment option for many forms of low back pain especially when accompanied by radicular leg pain, a condition commonly known as sciatica. They have been used routinely for low back problems since 1952, although the earliest recorded instance of an injection into the epidural space was in 1901. It is precisely because this procedure is so routine and has been done for so many years that patients, as well as many of those within the medical community itself, suppose that the efficacy of the procedure must have long since been established. The truth, however, is that although there are many studies documenting the short-term benefits of epidural steroid injections, the efficacy of long-term effectiveness continues to be debated and is not well studied in the literature. In fact, the greatest risk posed by ESI's may very well be the delay in receiving appropriate treatment allowing the continued progression of degenerative changes of the spine which go unnoticed because of the short-term, temporary relief of pain.
<br /><br />In addition, the ideal number of epidural injections to be administered for a given clinical scenario is often unclear because there is no clear data in the current literature on the exact number of ESIs to be administered and the timing that should be employed. Current clinical practice patterns suggest a &quot;series&quot; of 3 epidural injections per episode be recommended, regardless of clinical response, although there are no medical outcome studies to clearly support such a regimen. If the first and second were ineffectual, then what would make one think that the third would be? Further, if you had trouble getting your car started on three separate occasions wouldn't you begin to suspect that something was wrong?
<br /><br />An Epidural steroid injection reduces pain because it contains corticosteroids that mimic the effects of the naturally occurring hormones cortisone and hydrocortisone which serves to reduce inflammation around irritated nerves. The effect of the steroid is temporary and the cause of the nerve irritation, commonly the degenerative changes of the disc resulting in a bulge or herniation yet remains. Worse, there's a chance these hormones in such artificially high concentrations might actually weaken the spinal bones, ligaments, and the tendons of nearby muscles compounding the problem. ESI's are usually limited to just a few a year because steroid injections also suppress the body's natural hormone balance and can lead to adrenal insufficiency, a serious medical condition. Delaying repeat injections is presumed to allow your body a chance to return to its normal balance although there is little evidence to support this notion. The risk of these side effects may increase with the number of steroid injections received and the dose given in each injection.
<br /><br /><strong>Other Risks Include:</strong>
<br /><br />Death of nearby bone (osteonecrosis)
<br />Joint infection
<br />Nerve damage
<br />Skin and soft tissue thinning around injection site
<br />Temporary flare of pain and inflammation in the joint
<br />Tendon weakening or rupture
<br />Thinning of nearby bone (osteoporosis)
<br />Whitening or lightening of the skin around injection site
<br /><br />mayoclinic.com/health/cortisone-shots/MY00268/DSECTION=risks
<br /><br /><strong>What is the Alternative?</strong>
<br /><br />Modern medical science has finally developed an effective alternative to endless injections or simply living with the pain - Spinal Decompression Therapy. Performed on a special, computer controlled table similar in some ways to an ordinary traction table a single disc level is isolated and by utilizing specific traction and relaxation cycles throughout the treatment, along with proper positioning, negative pressure can actually be created within the disc. It works by gently separating the offending disc 5 to 7 millimeters creating negative pressure (or a vacuum) inside the disc promoting the retraction of the bulging disc tissue. This negative pressure also pulls water, oxygen, and nutrients into the disc, thereby re-hydrating a degenerated disc and bringing in the nutrients needed to begin the healing process. As the disc retracts the pressure comes off the nerve eliminating the irritation that triggered the inflammatory process.
<br /><br />Spinal Decompression is an effective, safe, and cost-effective procedure without the risk of drugs, injections, surgery, or anesthesia. Spinal Decompression not only significantly reduces pain in many patients, but also enables the majority of patients to return to more active life styles.

No surgery.<br/><br/>Spinal Decompression Therapy, first approved by the FDA in 2001, has since evolved into a cost-effective treatment for herniated and degenerative spinal discs; one of the major causes of back pain.
<br /><br />Millions of Americans suffer from severe back pain or neck pain as a result of bulging or herniated discs. This bulging disc causes a pinched nerve with resulting arm pain or leg pain commonly called sciatica or sciatic nerve pain. In the past, a patient suffering from a bulging disc was usually given pain medication or steroid injections, instructed to refrain from physical activities, referred for physical therapy, and when they weren't progressing they were sent for spinal surgery or simply told to learn to live with it.
<br /><br /><strong>What Causes Most Back Pain?</strong>
<br />Excessive stress or injury to a disc weakens the outer fibers. As the outer fibers weaken, parts of the interior of the disc bulge out and the disc compresses or loses height. As it loses height it follows that the vertebrae above and below get closer together decreasing the amount of space (spinal stenosis) through which the spinal nerve root exits . As the bulge increases and the space decreases the spinal nerve root that exits at that level is also compressed (pinched). This leads to muscle spasms and inflammation (swelling) further diminishing the space for the nerve; and, because the normal mechanics (movement) of the joints are disturbed, interferes with the normal pumping action supplying nutrition to the disc. Starved for adequate nourishment the outer fibers of the disc become drier and weaker (degenerate) accelerating the process. Non-surgical spinal decompression or de-compression is designed to break this cycle.
<br /><br /><strong>How Does it Work?</strong>
<br />Spinal Decompression Therapy is a non-invasive, non-surgical treatment performed on a special, computer controlled table similar in some ways to an ordinary traction table. A single disc level is isolated and by utilizing specific traction and relaxation cycles throughout the treatment, along with proper positioning, negative pressure can actually be created within the disc. It works by gently separating the offending disc 5 to 7 millimeters creating negative pressure (or a vacuum) inside the disc promoting the retraction of the bulging disc tissue. This negative pressure also pulls water, oxygen, and nutrients into the disc, thereby re-hydrating a degenerated disc and bringing in the nutrients needed to begin the healing process.
<br /><br />Spinal Decompression is an effective, safe, and cost-effective procedure without the risk of drugs, injections, surgery, or anesthesia. Spinal Decompression not only significantly reduces pain in many patients, but also enables the majority of patients to return to more active life styles.

This article explains in easily understood terms the gradual progression of this condition and its causes, and offers a possible non-surgical solution that works - spinal decompression therapy.</em>
<br /><strong>
<br />What is Stenosis?</strong>
<br />Spinal Stenosis is a medical condition in which the spinal canal narrows and compresses the spinal cord and/or exiting nerve roots. Stenosis is from the Greek word meaning &quot;a narrowing&quot;. Central canal stenosis is a narrowing of the channel in the center of each vertebra through which passes the spinal cord on its way down the spine. Foraminal stenosis is a narrowing of the channel on either side of the vertebra where the spinal nerve roots exit on their way to various parts of the body such as down the arms or legs. The vertebral foramen is a small opening or hole for the exiting spinal nerve root that is formed where the downward notch in the bone of a vertebra meets the upward notch of the vertebra below it. Spinal stenosis may affect the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. Lumbar spinal stenosis results in low back pain and can radiate down the nerves into the buttocks, hips, thighs, legs, or feet. Cervical spinal stenosis results in neck pain and can radiate down the nerves into the shoulders, arms, wrists, and hands. 
<br /><strong>
<br />What Causes It?</strong>
<br />Although it is true that some individuals congenitally have larger or smaller canals than do others, the cause of the narrowing is usually a combination of 3 different degenerative factors present in varying degrees in different patients. First, when a disc herniates the bulge takes up space narrowing the nerve channel. Second, as the involved disc dries out and loses height (a process known as desiccation) it causes the vertebra to become closer together further narrowing the nerve channel. Third, as the stress on the joint compounds and osteoarthritis begins to result, bone spurs (osteophytes) form and ligaments thicken (hypertrophy) gradually narrowing the channel even further. These 3 factors in various combinations and degrees of severity compromise the space in the channel and conspire to compress (pinch) the spinal cord or nerve root. These 3 factors may also be referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease, the most common cause of spinal stenosis.
<br /><br />Spondylolisthesis and scar tissue formation as a result of prior surgical fusion are other factors that can contribute to spinal stenosis. Spondylolisthesis describes the anterior displacement of a vertebra or the vertebral column in relation to the vertebra below. Also, rarely, various bone diseases such as Paget's Disease or tumors in the spine are responsible for the narrowing. An MRI can rule in or rule out a wide range of possibilities rare though they may be.
<br /><br /><strong>A Non-Surgical Solution</strong>
<br />Spinal Decompression Therapy, first approved by the FDA in 2001, has since evolved into a cost-effective treatment for herniated and degenerative spinal discs, and the resultant spinal stenosis; one of the major causes of back pain and neck pain. It works on the affected spinal segment by significantly reducing intradiscal pressures. The vacuum thus created retracts the extruded disc material allowing more room for the pinched nerve, and will many times additionally increase the spacing between the vertebra as the involved discs are rehydrated, allowing even more room for the nerve. Furthermore, as the disc rehydrates its shock absorbing capabilities are restored reducing mechanical stress on the related structures (facet joints and supporting ligamentous tissues) slowing or halting the osteoarthritc damage. This is a non-surgical conservative procedure for patients suffering with bulging or herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome, sciatica, failed back surgery syndrome, and non-specified mechanical low back or neck pain resulting in spinal stenosis.

<br /><br />Everyone has at one time or another applied too much pressure to the &quot;funny bone&quot; in their elbow which is actually the ulnar nerve. This physical pressure disrupts the nerve's function causing pain, tingling, numbness or weakness from the elbow into the fingers of the hand. Too much pressure applied for too long to a nerve along the spine results in much the same sensations. Where these sensations occur naturally depends upon the pathway of the specific involved nerve as illustrated above.
<br /><br />Nerve pain resulting from direct physical pressure is called an entrapment neuropathy because the nerve is trapped or pinched by some structure. This term helps to distinguish them from neuropathies resulting from infection or disease where the nerve pain is more often referred to as neuritis or neuralgia.
<br /><br /><strong>Radiculitis / Radiculopathy</strong>
<br />These are not specific conditions, but rather describe a nerve that is being pinched at or very near the spinal cord at the beginning or ''root'' of the nerve. Radiculitis is from Latin radiculo for root plus itis for inflammation. Radiculopathy comes from the same Latin radiculo for root plus Greek pathos for suffering. There may be slight technical differences between the two words but in truth they are often used interchangeably without clear distinction.
<br /><br />In a radiculitis or radiculopathy the pinch is occurring at or near the root of the nerve along the spinal cord. The most common cause of this physical pressure is a herniated or protruding spinal intervertebral disc crushing the nerve against the bone resulting in pain at that level of the spine in the neck or back, and of course, along the pathway of the adjacent nerve root itself resulting in arm pain or leg pain through a process called referred pain or radicular pain. For example, a nerve root impingement in the neck, or cervical spine, can produce pain, motor weakness, or sensory paresthesia in the shoulder, arm or hand which is called brachial radiculitis from Latin brachio for arm or more simply a cervical radiculitis or cervical radiculopathy. Likewise, a nerve root impingement in the lower back or lumbar-sacral spine can be manifested with symptoms in the lower extremity, a lumbar radiculitis or lumbar radiculopathy. This can result in pain, weakness, numbness, or paresthesia in the butt, hip, leg or foot. This is often called sciatica, a reference to the nerve that is being pinched. Sciatica due to compression of one of the lumbar nerve roots is one of the most common forms of radiculopathy. 
<br /><br /><strong>Neuritis / Neuralgia</strong>
<br />Neuritis is from itis for inflammation and neuro for nerve. Neuralgia is from the Greek algos for pain and neuro for nerve. The difference between neuritis and neuralgia are again technical and these terms too are often used interchangeably. The most common cause of neuritis or neuralgia are generalized metabolic issues such as those that occur as a result of diabetes or alcoholism, and as such, the nerve dysfunction is generalized and widespread as opposed to being one specific nerve root such as in sciatica that is caused by direct physical pressure. Acute or chronic Poisoning most commonly by lead, arsenic, mercury, copper and phosphorus also results in widespread nerve dysfunction also correctly termed a neuritis or a neuralgia.

		<document id="20b50551f26d35cf96c4fe668e70e18a" url=""><![CDATA[Anatomy of the Spine and Disc<br/><br/>The spine is made up of a chain of bones, called vertebrae , separated by discs, all of which are connected together by ligaments and muscles. The vertebrae cover and protect the spinal cord which travels from the brain down a channel in the middle of each vertebra called the central canal. Where two vertebra come together a notch is formed in the side (lateral) through which exit spinal nerve roots as they branch off the spinal cord. This notch is called the intervertebral foramen (hole) or lateral recess.
<br /><br />There are 3 sections of spinal vertebrae. The 7 vertebrae in the neck are called cervical vertebrae, the 12 vertebrae in the middle section are thoracics to which the 12 pairs of ribs attach, and the 5 bottom vertebrae in the lower back are lumbars. Each section is numbered from top to bottom so C1 attaches to the skull at the top and L5 attaches to the pelvis at the bottom.
<br /><br />A disc separates each vertebra and acts like a cushion, absorbing shock along the spine and allowing motion between each segment. The disc is a cartilage-like material made up of a jelly-like substance in the center known as the nucleus, covered with many strong and fibrous, ligament-like outer layers called the annulus. These type tissues do not have a rich blood supply like most other body tissues to nourish and replenish them; rather, disc tissue depends on a transfer of extracellular fluids to bring in the needed nutrients and oxygen. This transfer of fluid occurs between the bone (vertebral body endplate) above and below the disc and depends on the difference in pressure between the inside of the discs and the surrounding tissues. This is why normal joint motion that results in a pumping action is so essential, and explains why most disc nutrition and regeneration takes place when we lie down - because the pressure inside the disc is reduced and the fluids migrate toward the area of low pressure. This process is not very efficient, and slows down as we age, so that the disc can rather easily be exposed to wear and tear exceeding its ability to heal and regenerate - a process known as degeneration or degenerative disc disease.
<br /><br />Any number of factors in addition to age can cause or contribute to degenerative disc disease. Obesity which creates additional gravitational stress on each joint is another. Not enough exercise results in a gradual weakening of the supporting muscle and ligamentous structures making the disc prone to injury from ordinary everyday activities as we use our backs each day through sitting and standing, bending and lifting. Too little activity during the week followed by too much activity on the weekend can also result in injury. Naturally, falls or accidents can directly injure even a healthy spinal joint, but is made all that much worse if it is in a weakened state to start.  Repeated episodes of even minor injuries can eventually result in muscle tension and/or inflammation limiting the motion, and thusly the pumping action of the disc, which becomes stiffer and drier causing it to lose its shock absorbing properties, and making it more prone to yet another injury. This is the very definition of degeneration where each incident lowers the pain and subsequent injury threshold so that eventually the most ordinary of activities such as walking through the grocery store is too much. Poor health habits including too much soda pop/not enough water, inadequate nutrition, alcohol use, and nicotine use contribute. There may also be an as of yet unidentified genetic factor causing some individuals to be more likely to develop this condition.
<br /><br />Any combination of events or circumstances that result in a weakening of the outer annular fibers of the disc may eventually lead to a bulging or herniation of disc material that can pinch the adjacent nerve root or spinal cord causing additional problems.

Modern medical science finally has an answer to help alleviate the suffering.</strong></em>
<br /><br />Almost as common as the common cold, back pain and neck pain is thankfully not at all serious. I draw this conclusion not from 30 years of experience working with those who actually suffer with a chronic bad back, but after having read countless articles both online and off suggesting that most back pain goes away all by itself, usually within a few weeks. Often, the only treatment needed is a heating pad and an over-the-counter pain remedy, sometimes not even that. What a relief, and certainly reassuring. A few weeks makes back pain sound more like a minor inconvenience, not the second most common cause of disability as documented by the CDC* (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The most recent study shows that 47.5 million US adults (21.8%) reported a disability in 2005**, an increase of 3.4 million from 1999. Arthritis or rheumatism continues to be the most common cause of disability (8.6 million), while back or spine problems (7.6 million), and heart trouble (3.0 million) round out the top three causes. One can only suppose that if arthritis were to develop in the involved spinal joints that the chances of a later disability would more than double, and that if one tried hard enough, long enough to limit the pain by avoiding not only work, but also those fun activities (including eventually ordinary walking) that aggravated the pain, that one could look forward to future heart trouble. Although laying on the sofa watching the misfits on daytime talk shows come to blows is almost certain to get one's blood pumping, I find it doubtful that there is an actual cardio benefit. Combine all that with inevitable weight gain as months turn into years and we have just described a perfect storm leading toward skyrocketing scooter sales.
<br /><br />Among adults reporting a disability, so says the CDC, the most commonly identified limitations were difficulty climbing a flight of stairs (21.7 million, 10.0%) and walking 3 city blocks (22.5 million, 10.3%). Seriously, neither of these is an Olympic event and are, to the contrary, quite ordinary. That means that 1 in 10 adults have trouble walking a distance equal to walking from the parking lot to the back of a large store or through a mall. Perhaps this explains why handicapped parking spaces are always so near the door. Can you foresee a day when the trip from your recliner down the hallway to the bathroom seems like reaching the first base camp? If you can't, why not make a quick stop in the lobby of your corner rest home and ask a few of those folks if they ever thought they'd be in such bad shape as to need a nursing assistant to help them with the toilet.  A better plan might be to reserve the handicapped spaces on the farthest end of the lot for those who need the exercise the most and save the spots up front for those who are in a hurry to get back to work.
<br /><br />Many readers who needed to hear this have long since turned the page or clicked away but if by some slight chance you're still with me please understand that I'm not trying to be cruel - I'm trying to wake you up and teach you a valuable lesson while there is still hope. Don't you see that living with back pain is no different than living with chest pain? I'm willing to bet that most chest pain will go away all by itself, usually within a few weeks. A shocking statement? Yes, but it's true never-the-less (and if this sounds vaguely familiar re-read the second sentence of this article). Just how many times could you lay on the sofa with the heating pad and  a handful of ibuprofen patiently waiting for your chest pain to subside before disaster strikes? Ten times? Maybe100 times? The point is that no one was just fine yesterday and needs to file for disability and be helped to put on their socks tomorrow. How bad does it have to get before you do something? How many more warnings do you need? Better watch out for that 101st time.
<br /><br />Maybe chronic back pain is not considered a serious medical condition because you can't die from it. You can, however, become disabled or handicapped by it which is the new politically correct term for what used to be known as &quot;crippled&quot;, as 7.6 million Americans can attest. One could only hope that modern medical science would eventually have an answer for those who suffer with chronic neck pain and back pain, and there is -  non-surgical spinal decompression. First approved by the FDA in 2001, Spinal Decompression Therapy has since evolved into a cost-effective treatment for herniated and degenerative spinal discs which in turn leads to spinal stenosis and pinched nerves; one of the major causes of neck pain and back pain. Find out more. Your life depends on it.

How many times have you heard that stress causes health problems? Modern medical science finally has an answer.</strong></em>
<br /><br />I'm not going to argue that you can't live with back pain. Of course you can. For proof just look in the mirror. There is a long list of various maladies that could cause back pain, and to be sure, a few of them such as spinal meningitis are life threatening, but for the most part garden-variety bone/muscle/nerve back pain, often referred to as mechanical back pain, is not something that you will die from - therefore, you can live with it. Elementary logic. Simple stuff, really. Back pain is not like chest pain where there is a very real possibility that you might die from the coming heart attack. Most assuredly it is stressful to live with a bad back, never knowing  for sure whether tomorrow will be a good day or a bad day, but certainly not life threatening. The real question is can you live with the constant stress of chronic neck pain or back pain? Should you do less and less as months turn into years in a futile effort to avoid the pain? Should you take more and more, and stronger and stronger drugs in an effort to continue a normal life? And, perhaps, most importantly, if there was a way to halt or slow down the gradual progression from cane to walker to scooter, would you do it?
<br /><br />The real problem with chronic neck pain and back pain is not the pain it causes, but the stress it causes. How many times have you heard that stress causes health problems? A true enough statement insofar as it goes but it is more accurate to state that stress causes chemical changes within your body that when prolonged eventually result in health problems. Say, for instance, that you go out to your mailbox to check the mail and find a letter from the IRS. Would your blood pressure go up? The onset of a stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through the release of adrenaline and other hormones to facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and respiration, constricting blood flow to the internal organs, facilitating blood flow to the skeletal muscles, and a host of others all evolved to increase your chances of survival.  These are the things you can't live with. Would you get a knot in your stomach? An IRS audit doesn't cause ulcers but the stress of an IRS audit, or more specifically the chemical changes that occur as the result of the stress, may. The interactions of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands are a major part of the neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress and regulates many body processes, including the circulatory system, digestion, the immune system, mood and emotions, sexual vitality, and many, many, many others. How do you sleep between now and audit day? Stress can interfere with a very long list of vital functions.
<br /><br />Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStressor"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressor</a>) states that a stressor is a chemical or biological agent, environmental condition, an external stimulus or an event that causes stress to an organism. An event that triggers the stress response may include for example:
<br />·	environmental stressors (elevated sound levels, over-illumination, overcrowding)
<br />·	daily stress events (e.g. traffic, lost keys)
<br />·	life changes (e.g. divorce, bereavement)
<br />·	workplace stressors (e.g. role strain, lack of control)
<br />·	physical stressors (e.g. tobacco, alcohol, drugs)
<br /><br /><strong>
<br />Stress Comes in an Endless Variety of Forms</strong>
<br />Clearly stress comes in an endless variety of forms. However, the physiologic response, complicated though it may be, is basically the same regardless of the source of the stress. Everyone at one time or another has had a rock in their shoe. How did you know there was a rock in your shoe? Why, the little nerve on the bottom of your foot that was pinched or irritated by the rock somehow communicated said fact to your brain. Naturally your foot hurts, this much is apparent, but is that all? The more steps you take and the faster you walk the more it hurts so obviously it makes sense to slow down and to avoid walking altogether whenever possible. Pain itself is a physical stressor. Doing less will certainly help, but there is a limit to how little you can get by with, and losing your job would result in yet another kind of stress. By the end of the week would you be a little irritable? By the end of the month your foot will be throbbing whether you are walking on it or not. You're not sure whether you don't sleep well because you can never quite seem to get it into a comfortable position or because, like the caffeine in a cup of coffee, the adrenaline in your blood stream is interfering with restful sleep. After a few months of this you'll notice that you have high blood pressure. Both adequate sleep and proper exercise are essential to controlling high blood pressure, but remember you're trying to limit your activities to prevent your foot from hurting so badly. Even if you took enough ibuprofen to cover up the pain and exercised anyway it is doubtful it would help because elevated blood pressure is a natural response to a stressor (such as a pinched nerve) and has just been compounded by the chemical stress of the drug. The heartburn you're experiencing could simply be the physical stress or may be from the chemical stress of too much ibuprofen. You'll feel tired all the time too, but whether this is because every step requires extra effort, because you don't sleep well, or because of adrenal fatigue you can't quite be sure.
<br /><br />The solution seems so obvious, simply shake the rock out of your shoe to un-pinch the nerve. No one would walk around for long with a rock in their shoe, and not because you can't live with foot pain because I'm guessing you can. It's the other stuff you can't live with. So was all that a gross exaggeration just to make a point? Not at all, many people are walking around trying to live with back pain and neck pain too without realizing the far reaching effects of this stress on the other systems of the body. Further, if that much misery could be caused by irritating a rather insignificant nerve at the bottom of your foot, or from a letter from the IRS, just imagine the effect of irritating the spinal cord or a major spinal nerve root for days, weeks, and months at a time.
<br /><br /><strong>What's the Answer?</strong>
<br />Modern medical science finally has an answer for those who suffer with chronic neck and back pain - non-surgical spinal decompression. But, only you have the answer to the most fundamental question. If there was a way to halt or slow down the gradual progression from cane to walker to scooter, to stop the pain, and to reduce the stress, would you do it? If there was a way to reduce the stress, to feel better, and to be active again would you do it?

Nearly everyone at some point in their life will experience a lifting, twisting, or falling injury that will result in acute pain severe enough to interfere with work, play, and other activities of daily living. Some of these acute injuries will result in chronic pain.</strong></em>
<br /><br />Americans spend more than $50 billion each year on low back pain alone. It is the most common cause of job-related disability and the second most common cause of all disability as documented by the CDC* (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Only disability due to arthritis or rheumatism is more common. Heart trouble at number three follows.
<br /><br />Most of these injuries to the neck and back will be quickly forgotten and are of no more significance than a twisted ankle. Some, however, will result in a residual mechanical dysfunction that eventually leads to matters more serious. To make it simple, imagine for a moment that you forcibly hit the curb with the front tire of your car, an acute injury to the wheel, if you will. If you were lucky there may be no damage at all, simply a scary bump and you drive on your merry way, the impact soon forgotten. But, hit the curb a bit harder, at a less favorable angle, and you can bend the wheel or twist a support strut. Now what happens? Well, initially it steers a little funny, but you tell yourself it doesn't. You tell yourself that maybe it was always that way - the car is, after all, no longer new. You tell yourself that it is not really that bad and you can learn to live with it. You tell yourself that others likely have cars that pull to one side or the other too, especially on bumpy roads. Eventually, of course, you'll notice that the tire is going bald. This makes it really hard to steer, especially in the rain. Mechanical dysfunctions gradually get worse and sooner or later bald tires go flat so that you are un-able to drive the car. Likewise, degenerating discs eventually result in a dis-ability.
<br /><br /><strong>Disabled Is Usually Reserved To Describe Someone Who Is Not Able To Work</strong>
<br />That day can be postponed by doing less and less which is really no different than driving your car less and less. Perhaps a steering problem would be easier to tolerate at a lower speed and if you only drove on sunny days, never in the rain. If you had a car like this would you learn to live with it? If you were unable to stand or walk or sit due to back pain or neck pain what would you call it? &quot;Un-able&quot;, &quot;not-able&quot;, and &quot;dis-abled&quot; are quite similar although disabled is usually reserved to describe someone who is not able to work and thus unable to earn a living.
<br /><br />Wear and tear in the wheel world results in a bald tire that eventually goes flat and leaves you stranded on the side of the road. Wear and tear in the neck and back world results in degenerative joint disease or degenerative disc disease that gradually results in a lesser and lesser ability to do the things you need to do, and to do the things you love to do. Tires and wheels can be fixed, you don't have to learn to live with it.  Finally, modern medical science has a non-surgical solution to neck pain and back pain that actually works too - non-surgical spinal decompression. You no longer have to learn to live with it.

		<document id="6ef471c27902fa7716e499f19ae261df" url=""><![CDATA[Exercises For Your Bulging Disc<br/><br/><strong>A generation ago it was expected that you would spend your golden years in a rocking chair on the porch. Now we demand more.</strong><em></em>
<br /><br />Half of your friends, family, and co-workers are telling you to do less. If it hurts to sit, then you should sit less. If it hurts to stand or walk, then you should stand or walk less. Just do less and less, less and less often which reminds me of the old joke, &quot;Doc, it hurts when I laugh. What do I do?&quot; Stop laughing of course. Common sense, really. The other half of your friends, family, and co-workers are telling you to do more. No pain, no gain. If you don't use it, you lose it. Push through the pain and other platitudes. So, if you're at all good at math, you'll realize at once that exactly half these people are wrong, but which half?
<br /><br />As it so happens, both halves are right half the time which means that they're also wrong about half the time. Exercising a herniated or protruding disc is a little bit like driving faster with a flat tire. It's a bumpy ride and it tears up the tire. Doesn't it makes more sense to pull off the road and stop? Yes, it is rather confusing considering that you've all had it hammered into you how important exercise is supposed to be. I've seen patients who have been prescribed a back brace or neck collar, and have been taken out of work, and have stopped doing all the fun things, all of which is of course designed to limit joint motion and relieve muscle strain, who have also been prescribed physical therapy and home exercises. Aren't these polar opposites? Isn't rest the opposite of exercise?
<br /><br /><strong>Brushing and Flossing Won't Help</strong>
<br /><br />Understand that spinal exercises in the world of physical medicine are a lot like brushing and flossing in the dental world. If you have a toothache can you buy a new tooth brush and double down on flossing to make the pain go away? No, you cannot, because brushing and flossing won't help you with the underlying cavity that is causing the pain. You know this to be true so why is it that you hear so much about the importance of brushing and flossing if we all agree that it won't stop a tooth from aching? Obviously because brushing and flossing helps prevent tooth decay, it doesn't fix it - it helps prevent it. 
<br /><br />Back and neck exercises won't fix a disc problem either for the same reason and if done too soon or too rigorously can actually make matters worse. So why is it that you hear so much about the importance of spinal exercises for back pain and neck pain? Because it helps prevent next time. You see, a flat tire won't ever change itself but sometimes a disc can heal itself without intervention, then exercise can help prevent a recurrence. Rest it to start by doing less and as the bulge or protrusion subsides gradually exercise more with the goal of preventing next time.
<br /><br />If the bulge or protrusion doesn't heal on its own, get help. True, like having a flat tire you could either drive anyway and cause further damage or not drive at all, but that's no way to live and just postpones the inevitable. I suppose it's also true that you could live with a toothache, but not for long enough I'm afraid. What could have been handled with a simple filling eventually requires a root canal, then crowns or bridges, and later false teeth. No one voluntarily gets false teeth just like no one voluntarily gets spinal surgery, but too soon you run out of choices.
<br /><br />Doesn't it make more sense to deal with the disc that is causing the pain and then do the necessary exercises to prevent next time? When a damaged disc simply won't heal by itself find out about spinal decompression before you run out of choices. Modern medical science finally has an answer for those who suffer with chronic neck pain or lower back pain.
