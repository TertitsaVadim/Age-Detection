<br /><br />I, Thomas Wood, was Head of Lower School at Brooksbank School, Elland for 16 years, before I retired after 40 years of being a teacher. I am an Ex Deputy Mayor of Calderdale, and Ex Councillor of four years for Calderdale, and am 87 years old.  I am shocked that Jack Darrell Henry has been taken to court as he was the person who was responsible for identifying that our address 2/4 Rochdale Road, Greetland was in the incorrect council tax band.<br /><br />His company contacted me, we completed all the necessary paperwork, which can be provided if necessary, and they arranged with the Valuation Office Agency for the council tax banding to be reduced. This occurred within a 6 week period, we then received a refund dating back to overpayments made back to 1st April 1993. This paperwork was signed whilst in the company of my wife.<br /><br />In total we received in excess of 3850 pounds in refund from Calderdale Council.

<br /><br />I am happy with the outcome of my council tax banding, at one point I was a little concerned due to the length of time it took, but am very pleased with my refund cheque of just over 3000 pounds. It has come in very useful as I now live in Spain.<br /><br />Thank you Council Tax Review

<br /><br />I wrote to the valuation office agency in January 2011, they wrote back informing me that they did not agree with lowering my council tax band, I have attached a copy of the letter, even though my neighbours were in a lower banding than me. They informed me in this letter that I had no right of appeal against their decision that they had made.<br /><br />Reband (formerly CTR) contacted me and informed me that they were confident that they could get the banding lowered. I agreed to proceed and paid the relevant fee of 165 pounds on the 14.07.2011.<br /><br />I was informed in December 2011 that my banding has been successfully lowered and we have received a refund of just over 1850 pounds. I cannot understand why they refused to lower my banding when I first applied, it just seems that the council do what they want. I must just say thanks to CTR for sorting it out for me.<br /><br />No wonder the company is being taken to court, they are proving that the government do what they want with us tax payers.

<br /><br />I signed up with Council Tax Review on the 16.12.2010 with a gentleman called Dave Waterworth, a representative of Council Tax Review.<br /><br />I explained in great detail to Dave that I had built a substantial extension on my house and that I was concerned that the banding may increase instead of being lowered. He assured me that the building of an extension would not be a problem as I had built it after 1st April 1991 and it would not affect my application for my council tax band lowering. He went on to explain that the house would be ‘highlighted’ and an improvement indicator would be put on the address, meaning the next council tax payer would probably get an increase in the council tax banding.<br /><br />He convinced me by showing me point of sale material and literature, and I signed up for their service.<br /><br />In October 2011 I was informed that the council tax banding had been reduced, and I have since received a refund of over 2000. More importantly, I am self employed and the extra little I ca

<br /><br />I have tried on numerous occasions to reduce my council tax bandings with no avail. I have even contacted two local MP’s and requested their help and support in getting my bandings reduced, on both occasions I have been informed that due to me living there for more than 6 months, I am outside my legal time limit of six months, and have no further right of appeal.<br /><br />So you can imagine my surprise when Jack Henry’s company told me that I had a really good chance of getting my council tax lowered, they were offering there services and charged 95 pounds to get my council tax ban reduced.<br /><br />I completed the paperwork and to my complete surprise, within 12 weeks they had reduced my council tax banding and obtained me a refund cheque direct from Kirklees Council totaling in excess of 1800 pounds.<br /><br />I think it is scandalous and am appalled that Jack Henry’s company is being taken to court, he has achieved something for me that two MP’s failed to achieve, and not only that all my future bil

<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise to get my money back after paying money in that I shouldn’t have done.<br /><br />Your help and advise and dedication given from all concerned at Council Tax Review makes me wonder why I did not contact you earlier.<br /><br />Thank you and keep up the good work.<br /><br />Regards

<br /><br />In 1993 I tried to get my property re-banded by the Valuation Office, but I was informed that I was in the correct band for what the property was valued at at that present time.<br /><br />In September 2010 I received a flyer from Council Tax Review and contacted them regarding getting my property re-banded. I signed a contract with them in September 2010.<br /><br />In September /October of this year an officer from the Valuation Office Agency came out to my property, requested by CTR, to review my council tax band, while he was present he also looked at my neighbours property. I was then informed the following month by CTR that my banding request had been successful, and was also informed that my neighbour’s property had been assessed and lowered as well. I have received a refund of the overpayments I have made backdated to April 1993.<br /><br />I am not surprised that the company is being taken to court as the council basically will not be able to afford all these refunds.

<br /><br />I received a flyer through my letterbox and decided to ring the number quoted. I spoke to a young man who asked me lots of questions surrounding the purchase price and when I purchased my property. After many questions he informed me that he believed that we were possibly in the wrong council tax banding.<br /><br />I arranged for a representative from Reband to visit my home, after a twenty-minute presentation of their services they informed me that would require an upfront fee of 185 pounds to proceed. I was very nervous of this and told the representative that I would only proceed if they took the upfront fee out of any monies refunded.<br /><br />They agreed to do this, so I signed the relevant paperwork, to my pleasant surprise the company arranged for my council tax banding to be reduced, I received a refund of over 2000 pounds and all my future bills are cheaper.<br /><br />I find it refreshing how this company have spotted that we are in the wrong council tax banding, why can the council not do the same.

<br /><br />I was contacted by Jack Henry’s company via a mail-shot that was put through my letterbox, I then arranged for a representative to come and see me on the 04.12.2009, Jack Henry and a Trainee advisor turned up called Richard Webster and advised me that they would be successful in getting my council tax banding lowered, and that this would result in a refund of overpayments dating back to 1993, after a little consideration I decided to go ahead with the process.<br /><br />The decision was made a little easier as I knew Richard Websters father for many years and thought that the connection was solid enough to trust the company.<br /><br />I am glad I did, not only did the get me in excess of 1900 pounds back, all my future bills are cheaper. Not only that the company has worked on behalf of 5 of my neighbours, who have all been re-banded and have all received substantial refunds.<br /><br />I think it is a waste of tax payers money that they are taking Mr Henry to court, they should spend it getting the council tax

<br /><br />ARE YOU IN THE WRONG COUNCIL TAX BAND?<br /><br />IN response to Kevin Core's article on Monday, July 5, about the Council Tax Review: We provide a service to clients who frankly are being ridden over roughshod by a government agency and local authorities. <br /><br />With respect to Valuation Office Agency (VOA) officer Niall Walsh, we have clients who have been refused a reassessment and review/refund with no explanation why. They have neighbours in the same street with identical houses and similar circumstances who have been successfully reassessed and refunded. <br /><br />We have the knowledge and expertise on how banding was determined and how to seek reassessment if it is incorrect. We collated the evidence necessary to prove when bandings are incorrect. This is something which the VOA expect people to do who very often do not know how to deal with these government agencies or are frightened to do so.
