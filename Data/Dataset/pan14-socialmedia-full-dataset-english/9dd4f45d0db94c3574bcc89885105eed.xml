Since annularity typically occurs throughout resolution, centrifugal progress is not commonly observed. Common psoriatic scale is generally existing on the border, but when the condition is beneath energetic treatment method, the development of scale is minimal or absent. Prognosis is not ordinarily difficult, since more common lesions of psoriasis can be discovered in other places on the body.
