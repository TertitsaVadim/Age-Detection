<br /><br />Work was a bit boring today.... I went in early...ish (8AM) and worked through till twelve, looking forward to seeing my friends at lunch, but then I was told I had to go to this technical talk thing.... but oh well... I had free food... but it meant I had to work an extra half hour at the end of the day to make up the time.... Damn annoying!! but the food was good... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Then I came home and we had to tidy up the flat a bit and go shopping before we could cook dinner... it was like half nine before we had our stir-fry!
<br /><br />Now I've just finished a piece of coursework on a management course that my work makes me do... oh well... it wasn't too bad... I made up a load of stuff about things I needed to improve on... just like being back in school really!!... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />  - lol

<br /><br />But then I got onto the top of the hill, and the wind picked up, so i had to put some more clothes on! - hehe

I ordered it from a shop in Birmingham, and they had to get it sent down from another store in Hull; they told me it would be around 3 working days... which was fine
<br /><br />BUT... I rang up after three days, and they said &quot;yeah, it's here&quot;... so I went in, and then they were like &quot;oh... we made a mistake... it's not here&quot;.. which is fair enough... I can understand... it took another week after that before it was actually there!!!... grrrrr! - lol
<br /><br />Oh well.. it's here now, and black and awesome and... oh so shiny!!!
<br /><br />Schecter Omen 6 by the way... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />That means it's practically Friday, which means it's pretty much the weekend, which means it's almost next week, which makes it pretty close to the week after, which means it's almost CHRISTMAS!!... (and by that logic.... it's practically next year, pretty much summer... and yeh... i'm almost DEAD!... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  - oh well... cna't have everything I guess!!)

		<document id="e661f140b5d21dc793e1cab95bbf8d86" url=""><![CDATA[Wondering<br/><br/>Well, I was sat here after coming back from town, and was just thinking and wondering about stuff...
<br /><br />I started to wonder about why people think about the things they do, and why people have preconceptions about things.
<br /><br />Like, why ginger people always get made fun of... what's wrong with being ginger?... (or red-heads if I'm being diplomatic!)...
<br /><br />Or, why what makes people attractive?... Why do we think some people look 'hot', but others not so much.
<br /><br />Why is some stuff just rubbish, but other stuff 'art'?
<br /><br />Why do colours in a room or on the clothes we wear go together?... why do we think that some colours really don't go?...
<br /><br />Why do we have a favourite colour, why does that colour say something about us?... what made someone decide what colours could/would say about people...
<br /><br />Okay, so I don't expect answers to these questions, though there are probably answers to some of them somewhere, and perhaps a few seperate and different answers to some questions, but all equally valid.
<br /><br />Anyways yeh... it made me think a bit, and that's not always a bad thing (especially when you cross the road!)
<br /><br />Love Chris XxX
