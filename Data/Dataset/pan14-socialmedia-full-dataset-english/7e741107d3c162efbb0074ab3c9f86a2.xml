<br />Hindu Astrology is the traditional astrology of India and its cultural sphere, going back to the ancient Vedic culture in times, which we (at least) regard as prehistoric. It is based on the Vedas, the original scriptures of India and perhaps all the Indo-European peoples.  
<br /><br />Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs have all used Hindu astrology. It was practiced in the whole of India and in parts of present-day Persia, Afghanistan and Russian Central Asia. It followed Hindu and Buddhist influence into Indochina and Indonesia. systematically, stage by stage.  
<br />Hindu Astrology is also called &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; from the culture and religion that developed along with it. Like Hinduism, it is a pluralistic and adaptable system emphasizing many paths and taking on ever-new incarnations. Therefore, it is certainly useful and adaptable in the West today, along with the yoga and meditation systems that have already come to us from India and from which so many people have derived benefit.  
<br />Another name for Hindu Astrology is Jyotish, which means &quot;the science of light.&quot; Jyotish means astronomy, astrology and meteorology. As a limb of the Vedas, the very eye of the Vedas, it was called Vedanga Jyotish, &quot;Jyotish or astrology, the limb of the Vedas,&quot; which is how it is referred to in traditional texts.  
<br />Hindu Astrology recognizes the validity of all four aims of life and is oriented to facilitate us in the attainment of each of them. Yet the first three, enjoyment, wealth and career, are made subordinate to the last, spiritual liberation, Liberation is the primary and essential goal for all human beings, for all life. Without it the other goals have no real meaning.  
<br />The purpose of Hindu Astrology is not to make us feel subject to external forces but to help us use our lives for greater Self-unfoldment. For this we must first understand ourselves.Without some degree of self-knowledge the astrologer, even if he can perceive subtle planetary influences, will merely impose his own judgements upon his clients.  
<br />Hindu Astrology, like the science of yoga, arose from the vision of the ancient seers of India, the Vedic Rishis. The rishis were great beings of spiritual realization and occult perception that lived in the legendary ages of light and truth. Their knowledge was passed down through the millennia by way of oral tradition. Much of it has been lost, but the core still remains. Hindu astrology is accessible on the deeper levels of the mind as the heritage of the spiritual humanity, a heritage from which we have fallen away. If we look to the presence of the rishis as our inner spiritual progenitors, their knowledge can again return to us.

Because here you experience the kind of beauty that is inexplicable – Nature follows a set pattern with a deadly accuracy. The sun always rises in the east and sets in the west; there’s a schedule the sea waves follow; the stars and planets hint at an alluring mystery that endures for centuries, and indeed our lives follow the cycle of nature – birth. Growth, decay and death, of might is right. Such efficiently set patterns convince us that there has to be a Master controller, a CEO somewhere there, someone who pulls the strings. Or at least someone who set up the project delegated and then walked away, beaming….
<br /><br />For the human mind, though fascinated by mysteries, cannot endure anything that isn’t resolved. And so, the end of all mystery is “God only knows” or “it’s a miracle!” That, which your mind cannot understand or grapple with, is then God!
<br /><br />But, can you believe in something or someone you have never seen or heard? Something your senses have never experienced? Why then do all of us hang on to our belief in God? Why do we continue to visit temples or even pray at home? Why does fear, more than any other emotion, drive us to believe in and chant the name of God with more fervour than any other time? Have you noticed how the more successful a person is, the more God-fearing he seems to become? Temple visits, offerings to God, crawling to a temple or walking barefoot for miles to reach a place of worship, seem to be the preserve of the rich and successful, who fear they will lose what they have. Their faith in God is their greatest antidote to that fear.
<br /><br />Sure, in an ever-changing world, it is best to hang onto some beliefs that do not change; to have faith in some constants – love of parents, support of siblings, and trust of children and existence of God. It all boils down to belief more than anything else ultimately. Faith indeed is all. Faith in your relationships, faith in people, faith in your beliefs and convictions, faith in your actions. Above all, faith in yourself.
<br /><br />And faith is tested the most when you are asked to believe something you have no empirical evidence for, or to put back your trust in something or someone that has let you down. Take for instance survivors of tsunami. How difficult it must be for them to trust once again for their livelihood the sea that took away their loved ones! To seek out and again trust themselves to the elements that destroyed them? But their faith endures and the fishing trawls are back on the waters.
<br /><br />Do you think it is easy for families to keep sending their sons into the armed forces after having suffered losses? Or, for soldiers to keep at it in treacherous terrain? But their faith in what they are doing for their nation endures and they carry on…
<br /><br />There are instances of people bringing back their loved ones from the jaws of death by faith alone. Even doctors, who throw up their hands medically, ask you to have belief in God. Only those marriages are known to survive where the couple has a belief in making it work. If you walk into a marriage or relationship telling yourself there is a way out in case this doesn’t work, you have already planned for the demise of what you are attempting to build. On the other hand if you tell yourself “this is it, for good or for bad,” there are more chances of the relationship working out.
<br /><br />Indian belief in Destiny or Fate is a great saviour for us. We blame all the unsavoury stuff on Destiny and so save ourselves a lot of pain. Along with this we also have this great faith that whatever happens is for good as it is ordained by Divinity and there’s a reason behind everything, which we may or may not understand. And so we know when setbacks strike that the power that sucked us in, will also get us out. This faith keeps the hope going and focuses positivity and energy on happy outcomes. 
<br /><br />Faith is everything. Faith IS god. If you believe, He is; if not, He isn’t… If you believe you can, there is no power on earth that can stop you. With this belief let us move into the new year with hope, faith and miracles…

<br /><br />Complexity of professions is assuming a more and more bewildering nature. To indicate exact means of livelihood, though the horoscope depends upon blending of the influences of planets, signs and houses and there too it would be very difficult to predict with exactitude.  
<br />We may say a man would be an engineer, but whether a civil, mechanical, electrical, mining or textile engineer, will depend upon the planet that has the greatest influence in livelihood. Another question that poses itself is whether a person would have the same source of livelihood throughout his life.  
<br />Many persons start their career in service and later do well in their own business. Further, in finding means of livelihood, can we make a distinction between salary and pension? Many retired servants enter business but most of them either enter private service or live on pension and savings or rent on buildings they own or have built. It is very difficult to analyses all factors carefully and predicts the tendencies governing one’s livelihood. Like any other sciences, astrology too has its own limitations. We have to realize it and it is the duty of those deeply interested in the science to increase its utility to society by earnest research and selfless efforts. 
<br /><br />In the matter of astrologically judging and determining different mundane houses are allotted to the different needs of Kalapurusha or the individual. There is one house for wealth, another for patrimony, the other for income, etc. There is one house; Karma viz. the 10th (midheaven) Karma is very broad term. Karma means the sum total of the good and bad deeds at our credit when we are born on this planet. Livelihood or avocation is only one facet of the term karma. Karma is not merely avocation but is a comprehensive term. 
<br />The twelve houses indicate different activities in the world. A professional means of earning a livelihood may be determined by the houses and planets which are prominent in a horoscope. If the 1st is strong, the native will earn by his personal efforts. If the 2nd is strong articles of food or speech would play a prominent part. The 3rd determines courage, brothers, heroic valour, communication, writing, short travel, etc. If the 3rd is strong and has connected with the 10th, the person may earn through writings and short travel. He may run a big business, may serve in army. If the 10th lord is connected with the 4th house and indications are strong, the person may get income from house or motor vehicle. The 5th has reference to learning, counsel, speculation, and games of chance. The harmonious dispositions of the 10th and the 5th indicate earnings through above means. The 6th represents sickness or diseases, if the 6th houses is connected to the 10th and the horoscope indicates medical studies the person may be a doctor by profession.  
<br />When the 8th and the 10th lords are connected the person may earn through foreign business or from property got through legacy. The 9th indications would be connected with the foreigners’ foreign lands, law, religion etc. The connected between the 9th and the 10th may bring earnings through practice of law or the person may become religious head or may earn through teaching or preaching. 
<br />The profession or occupation of a native is generally judged from the planet or planets occupying the 10th house and if there should be none there, from those in the 1st and also from those aspecting the Sun and the Moon. 
<br />Brihat Jataka. Adh. X. XL. 4, states the gain of money from livelihood should be ascertained from the strong benefic planets occupying the Ascendant.

The learned men of those days may not have lived in houses themselves but they most definitely dedicated their lives to the development of the science “vaastushastra” or “vaastu”, as it is popularly known today.
<br /><br />The principles of the science laid down during those days were based purely on the effect of sunrays during different times of the day. The observations and corrections made were noted and concluded only after in-depth screening of the situation.
<br /><br />Vastu is a part of Vedas, which are believed to be four to five thousand years old. Through penance and meditation yogis of that period acquired answers believed to have come from the cosmic mind itself to their questions. Hence Vedas are heeded with divine knowledge. The art of Vastu originates in the Stapatya Veda, a part of the Atharva Veda.
<br /><br />It used to be a purely technical subject and it was only confined to architects (Sthapatis) and handed over to their heirs. The principles of construction, architecture, sculpture etc., as enunciated in the epics and treatise on temple architecture, have been incorporated in the science of vastu. Its description is there in epics like Mataysya Purana, Skanda Purana, Agni Purana, Garuda Purana, and Vishnu Purana. There are some other ancient shastras that pass over the knowledge of vastu shastra to next generation, like Vishvakarma Prakash, Samraangan Sutradhar, Kashyap Shilpshastra, Vrihad Sanhita, and Praman Manjaree.
<br /><br />In the Mahabharata it is said a number of houses were built for the kings who were invited to the city Indraprastha for the Rajasuya Yagna of King Yuddhistira. Sage Vyasa says that these houses were as high as the peaks of Kailasa mountains, perhaps meaning that they stood tall and majestic. The houses were free from obstructions, had compounds with high walls and their doors were of uniform height and inlaid with numerous metal ornaments. It is said that the site plan of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Rama was similar to the plan found in the great architectural text Manasara. References are also to be found in Buddhist literature, of buildings constructed on the basis of Vastu. They contain references to individual buildings. Lord Buddha is said to have delivered discourses on architecture and even told his disciples that supervising the construction of a building was one of the duties of the order. Mention is made of monasteries (Viharas) or temples, buildings which are partly residential and partly religious (Ardhayogas), residential storeyed buildings (Prasadas), multi-storeyed buildings (harmyas) and Guhas or residential buildings for middle class people.
<br /><br />The Vastu, with word meaning ‘dwelling’, is believed to be the residing places of god and man. According to its modern meaning it covers all buildings irrespective of their use like residences, industries, business establishments, lodges, hotels etc. It is based on the five basic and essential elements, such as Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Jal (water), Bhumi (earth) and Aakasha (space), which are known as Panchabhutas. Everything on earth is built from these elements.

If it flows easily then your life is likely to flow more easily. If it is blocked or stagnant then your life is more like to feel that way. Feng Shui is a symbolic language and it is how you use Feng Shui Symbols which can affect the way your life is flowing.
<br /><br />This is not to say you have to use red Chinese lanterns, dragons at your doorway, fat Buddha’s and other Chinese decorating items to generate chi, it is about understanding the basics of what the Feng Shui symbols mean in any circumstance.
<br /><br />Take a look at any room in your home or office and consider what different objects mean to you.
<br /><br />Do they give you a good feeling and do they generate good chi or do they unconsciously send a message that is limiting your desires?
<br /><br />In a bedroom does it have a feeling of calm and order so you can sleep easily? Or do you have piles of clothes ion one corner, a broken light globe in a lamp beside your bed, a brightly colored wall which generates lots of energy or a mirror wardrobe which also generates a lot of chi or energy. All these items are disturbing your unconscious chi in terms of Feng Shi Symbols.
<br /><br />In your office do you face the door or is your back to the door and are you being literally stabbed in the back? Do you feel calm and centered in your office or do you jump every time someone comes into your office? How you feel in any space is an indication of how you feel and how the chi is flowing in your life.
<br /><br />It is the Feng Shui Symbols which make a difference.
<br /><br />So how do you correct Feng Shui Symbols which are causing problems? Always surround your self with things which symbolically make you happy.
<br /><br />In one consultation I did, a lady had proudly displayed a plate which she had received a gift from her husband 10 years ago. Shortly after she and her husband divorced and it had imbedded unconscious messages for her. Instinctively I asked how she felt about that plate without even knowing its history. I was stunned when she walked over to the plate picked it up and walked into her kitchen and threw the plate in the bin smashing it into many pieces. She felt an incredible weight had been lifted form her shoulders and thanked me profusely.
<br /><br />So look at all the things you have around you and consider what the mean symbolically to you. Are they allowing the Chi to flow and making you happy or are they creating unseen blockages for you? Feng Sui Symbols do all those things.Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

		<document id="ba23ea7c913e9fd64053d8d31c221128" url=""><![CDATA[How to Learn Tarot Cards?<br/><br/>Many people want to learn more about the tarot and using tarot cards, but finding tarot cards instructions that are geared for beginners can be tricky, especially if you are unsure of what, exactly, tarot cards are for.
<br /><br />First here is some basic tarot card information: tarot cards are not going to predict the future. They aren’t going to give you answers from the cosmos. What tarot cards do is speak to your intuition. Tarot cards are not going to tell you anything that some part of you doesn’t already know. The card can shed insight into a current situation or help you figure out answers to problems yourself. Keep that in mind as you read the following tarot card instructions.
<br /><br />1. Choose your tarot card deck carefully. This is not a normal deck of playing cards or a pack of trading cards that you are picking up. Each tarot card deck has its own energy and it is important to take your time in figuring out which deck you feel the most comfortable with. Look at the illustrations on the cards and pay attention to your senses. You will eventually find a deck that you feel a connection to and that is the deck you should purchase.
<br /><br />2. Even if you haven’t started to learn what each of the cards means, take some time to become familiar with each of the cards in your tarot card decks. Really look at the illustrations and start figuring out how each one of the cards fits into the different categories of cards.
<br /><br />3. Begin studying what each of the cards means. Putting meaning to each card is easier if you can easily call to mind the card when you are reading about it. Sure it is easy enough to do a tarot card spread and then look up the meaning of each card, but a tarot reading is far more fulfilling if you already know what the cards mean.
<br /><br />4. The easiest tarot card spread is the three card spread. This card spread gives you insight into the past, the present and the future that surround the question you are concentrating on. We’ve already said that tarot cards cannot predict the future, but they can give you some insight into your feelings about the future. Once you’ve mastered the three card reading, you are ready to move on to other card spreads.
<br /><br />These are just a few simple tarot cards instructions. Obviously there are more complicated card spreads and there are techniques to learning about the individual cards and what they mean. If you are just starting out, though, hopefully these tarot cards instructions will provide you with enough background information to start you on your journey to being a practiced reader of the tarot cards. Before you know it, you will be advanced enough to do readings for other people.Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

Today many scientists are carrying researches and have come to the conclusion that if non-vegetarian is consumed it leads to dangerous diseases like cancer etc.
<br /><br />Our eating habits and activities start from hand and mouth. Man does not have paws by which he can walk fast, whereas flesh-eating animals have big paws. Man can only bend his thumb and touch the other fingers. Hands are used more for eating fruits and vegetarian items. If we have to talk about teeth we can say that our teeth are organized in such a way that we can chew fruits and vegetables comfortably.
<br /><br />The animals that consume small trees, plants and leaves perspire through their skin. Flesh eating animals take the help of their tongue for all their chores, because their skin doesn’t have pores. In the same way man also perspires through skin because they are made for vegetarian food only.
<br /><br />Now we shall see the structure of stomach and intestines.
<br /><br />The meat requires liquid substance like hydrochlo-ric acid in the stomach for proper digestion of food.
<br /><br />Our stomach is made up in such a way that when compared to flesh eating animals it is capable of making only 1/20th part of the acid. The intestines of human beings, vegetarians and non-vegetarians are clearly noted. After digestion nutrients in the food enter into the blood. One piece of meat entering our blood stream makes it poisonous. That is why we should not consume meat. Meat eater’s intestine is thrice the size of their body where as human beings intestine is 12 times the size of their body. That is the reason why the meat remains in the intestines for a long time and leaves the poisonous material and also affects the kidneys. Kidneys are the main organs in the body, which throw the faecal matter out of blood but when the body consumes meat it has to take the poisonous materials for longer duration. People who take meat rarely, in their case the kidneys have to function thrice its capacity compared to the people who take vegetarian food. The bad affect of the meat influences the other important organs of the body, which leads to other type of diseases.Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

		<document id="3ebb5604ee64f74e412f1b8f5cbd4c7" url=""><![CDATA[Ritucharya -Lifestyle for Different Seasons<br/><br/>Ritucharya or seasonal regimen in different seasons has been described in extensive details by Ayurveda. The reactions of tridoshas to the seasonal variations have been described in terms of sanchaya, prakopa and prashama. ‘Sanchaya’ means of accumulation of doshas, ‘prakopa’ meaning the aggravation of doshas and ‘prasham’ denoting pacification of doshas.
<br />Ayurveda divides a year into two princdipal parts as per solar and lunar dominance viz. Uttarayana (Summer solstice) and Dakshinayana (Winter solstice). The former comprises of Shishir, Vasant and Grishma, whereas the latter comprises of Varsha, Sharad and Hemant.
<br />The Uttarayana is a period wherein, owing to the daily increasing heat, men go on losing their strength. It is called as ‘Adan Kala’. Whereas, in Dakshinayana, heat condition having being reserved, men go on adding to their strength. It is called as ‘Visarga Kala’. It is represented by a simple linear graph. (See last page)
<br />Ayurveda pays special attention to ‘ritusandhi’, i.e. a transitional period between two seasons. The change in the season is never abrupt one, but is gradual. The changdes in diet and routine during this period should be gradual which requires sometime adopting. 
<br /><br />VARSHA RITU (MONSOON) 
<br />The appetite (agni) becomes low which causes indigestion and creates apathy.
<br />The diet should not be heavy (guru) to digest and should be small in quantity also. Puffed rice, bhakri, chappatis, rice eaten with milk and a liquid preparation of gram flour (pithala) are ideal.. Avoid curds in general and prefer the buttermilk laced with asafoetida and ginger. Drinking water should be filtered and boiled.
<br />The use of grape wine (Drakshasava) is beneficial to reduce Vata.
<br /><br />SHARAD RITU (AUTUM) 
<br />The bright sunshine causes aggravation (Prakopa) of Pitta. During this season Pitta diseases like piles, hepatitis, raktapitta are commonly met with. Consumption of astringent, bitter and sweet items should be consumed in priority to pacify Pitta. 
<br /><br />Rice, Wheat, Jowar are good. Ginger and ghee stoke agni and pacify Pitta. Avoid too much work; sunshine and daytime sleep during this season. Cold water for bathing as well as for drinking suits in this season. Completely avoid alcohol consumption. Anoint the body with sandalwood or vetiver pastes to alleviate burning sensation.termilk laced with asafoetida and ginger. Drinking water should be filtered and boiled. The use of grape wine (Drakshasava) is beneficial to reduce Vata.
<br /><br />HEMANT RITU (EARLY WINTER) 
<br />In Hemant, the doshas are in pacified condition, the agni is high, hence overall this is the healthiest season of the year. This is the period of excellent health with high energy, peak immunity and strengthened agni, safely sending the doctors on leave.
<br />Increased capacity of agni necessitates the heavy (guru) diet and large in quantity as well, sweet, sour and salty food items, along with ghee and oils should be incorporated in the diet. Good amount of exercise, warm clothing, whole body massage with oils and hot-water bath is recommended. 
<br /><br />SHISHIR RITU (LATE WINTER)  
<br />Most dietary advice remains the same as that for Hemant, the only change in the selection should be about the potency of food items. Instead of cold potency, the food products of hot potency (heat generating) should be selected, to counteract the 
<br />excessive cold. The jaggery and sesame (Tila) are unctuous (snigdha) and hot (ushna) in attributes. In general, diet should be heavy (guru), unctuous and hot in attributes.
<br />Hot water bath is preferred and drinking water should also be hot. 
<br /><br />VASANT RITU (SPRING) 
<br />Heavy foods like eggs, chicken, sweetmeats and milk, bananas; dry fruits now should be avoided. Incorporation of ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, garlic, asafoetida, chilly and mustard in daily diet will be beneficial to stoke agni and alleviate kapha. Oils will be preferred than ghee. Buttermilk and milk will be better than curds. Use of honey is advisable. 
<br /><br />GRISHMA RITU (SUMMER) 
<br />Day becomes longer and night shorter. Diet should be light (laghu) and in small quantities. Sweet, sour, and astringent tasting food items should be consumed. 
<br />Whereas, one should restrict bitter, pungent and astringent food. Daily diet should contain bhakri, rice, wheat like sweet and unctuous (snigdha) stuffs. The quantity of ghee, oil and milk should be sufficient. Buttermilk should be consumed in ample. Milk products like curds, shrikhanda, are beneficial, in moderate quantities. Sourfruits like raw mango, kokam, amalaki are helpful. Pickles, jams and squashes of these fruits are commonly more consumed during this season. The fruits like pomegranate, watermelon, and grapes replenish the liquid portion, which are beneficial for rasa dhatu. Avoid garlic strictly and prefer onion.
<br />Cold-water bath with fragrant perfumes suits in this season. The clothing should be loose and while or light in colours. To prevent sun heat, cover the head with a cap and wear goggles. Daytime sleeping is only recommended during this season. Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

As human being, we have been gifted with an amazingly powerful brain. The human brain is a complex and highly developed organ. It consists of billion of cells, which are being used for analysing, storing and retrieving information. No computer can match the efficient and organised functioning of a healthy brain. 
<br /> Our ancient scriptures like ‘HATHA YOGA PRADEEPA’, ‘PATANJALI YOGASUTRAS’ told us about the various techniques to sharpen our memory. Anyone can hone up the memory by training it. The efficiency of the recalling system is what makes your memory good or bad. As such, there is nothing like good memory and bad memory.

<br /><br />People look for some one who can advise them either at a time of adversity or to have a good start in something.They do not want to depend on the scientific or set rules of evaluation rather they care for an intuitive or spiritual guidance at times. Numerology lies in between the scientific and spiritual thoughts and is fit to help the people at such a juncture. 
<br /><br />There are different ways in which a Numerical Chart can be read, depending either on the interest of the client or some salient features, which the Numerologist may be tempted to interpret first. Pointing out a few characteristics, which may strike the client and hence establish his confidence in you may be good to assume the validity of other things you are going to say, especially for the future. Quite often the clients place greater faith and power in the Numerologist than perhaps he is worth. However, a complete reading of the chart will depend on stepwise synchronisation of the Numbers at different positions.
<br /><br />100% accuracy can never be achieved by any method of calculation including Numerology. The job of the Numerologist should be to discuss the positive and negative points of each aspect in the Numerical chart and then leave the decision on the client. Some astrologers claiming accuracy are sometimes very successful but sometimes total failures and the clients lose faith in them. Only spiritual giants, unconcerned with the events of the world, can read 100% correct past, present and future through the Akashic records. But they do not open shops to earn money. They only advise for spiritual advancement of the individual. Through Numerology happenings can be seen approximately, sometimes very close to accuracy and the advice can be given accordingly. The final decision on whether to take a particular action r not, should always be left to the client.
<br /><br />The very design of the temple as an outer symbol of the existence of the Divine on the material plane, the act of visiting the temple, circling around the temple, entering the temple, the lighting of the lamps in front of the divine, the decorations and the ornamentation so characteristic of Hindu temples and places of worship, the manner in which the images are built and installed, the lighting of the lamps, the offerings, the method of worship, the partaking of prasad, and in short any practice that is mechanical, symbolic and ritualistic to a degree, form part of this approach only. 
<br /><br />The science of prediction coupled with meditation is ideal. The numbers have their meanings hidden in themselves but your intuitive power blended with calculation and reading will be more close to the accuracy and will not have a really soothing effect on the client.Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

Since Vastu deals with the micro level existence of body, mind, and intellect, its tenets, rules and regulations need comprehensive conceptual perception. bodies. 
<br /><br />Any divisive analytical efforts to diagnose its dimensions an only lead to futility and confusion. This comprehensive intellectual order of natural existence can be understood only through deep awareness. In ancient India, the learned and the enlightened Rishis divided knowledge in Metaphysical and Physical sciences, Jnana was the outcome of the mind, while Vijnana was the benevolent interface for the development of mankind. The abstract metaphysical thought was rendered into tangible scientific and engineering modes. It will be quite unnecessary to venture to guess at the time that has elapsed between the first and the third stages, and the changes that may have been caused by errors in understanding the due to individual interpretations. The Vastu texts available today are no &amp;amp;quot;divine scriptures&amp;amp;quot; nor could these be original 'words of the mouth'! However, these are enough to inform us how much the Rishis with their 'mind power' were able to relate the effect of the astral bodies in the universe and more specifically, solar radiation on the human 
<br />In order to decipher what lies concealed in the Vedas, a study of certain subjects is considered a prerequisite. These subjects are called the 'Vedangas' or the body organs of the Vedas. There are six such Vedangas. They are: 
<br /><br />Vastu is a super science and its multidisciplinary approach is based on basic knowledge of Yogashastra, Astrology, and Science. Therefore, a Vastu practitioner's responsibility to gauge the event becomes very difficult, and it is ridiculous to make tall and high claims while forecasting. The basic elements of Vastu being five great elements, eight directions, sun and moon streams, deities in Vastu Purush Mandal, study of vibrations, waves, sound and light, permutations and combinations of all these things. 
<br /><br />Vastu, Music, Astrology, Yogashastra and Ayurveda are five great holistic sciences which are completely interconnected and in totality form a comprehensive remedial field to convert an individual's journey of pain and struggle into harmony and rhythm. Vastu is an art of embodying the bliss and auspicious events from immensity of nature in a tiny enclave of self. 
<br /><br />Vastu has its roots in Yogashastra and Bharatiya Darshanshastra. Its purpose is peace and tranquillity to all. The basic principle of Vastu Science is least hindrance to natural energy streams. Astrology is another sister-discipline of Vastu where a lot of remedial measures can be attained through astrological knowledge. Reorienting self in natural streams enhances one's fortune far beyond expectations. In case studies it has been revealed that Vastu science plays a great productive and creative role in industrial structures. Crystals, water, herbs, plants, stones, pyramids, colours, metals, fish tanks, light and bells with proper application in Vastu give a new, lively environment leading Vastu to cosmic envelope. 
<br /><br />It should be understood that the basis of the Vastushastra must be the effect of the physical, climatological and social influence on the shelter and its occupants. The science, therefore, provided guidance to the extent it could foresee reaction. It is obvious that with intervention of modern technology, man has gained dominance and control over that aspect of Nature. 
<br /><br />As architects we are stunned at the rapidity and cunningness with which the tribe of the so-called Vastu pundits has been operating in our domain. The relevancy of Vastushastra today is more academic than real. The menace of the pseudo-pundits can be countered only by us becoming more knowledgeable of the ancient science. Whether we use it for spiritual or professional reason is another matter. But we must not forget that the strength of this pseudo-pundits is in the gullibility and blind faith of his victim, our client.  
<br /><br />Vastushastra is a vehicle between mystique and its understanding. Science has to offer an explanation of the phenomenon. It must lead to better understanding by both the intellectual and the common people in society .Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

<br />    All human beings should follow a sattvic or pure life-style that gives peace and clarity of mind. Physical purity includes pure diet, with raw or freshly cooked vegetarian food, pure air and water, proper exercise of a calming nature, as well as physical cleanliness.
<br />    Purity of mind includes truthfulness, honesty, humility, equanimity, non-violence, friendliness and compassion to all beings. Emotional impurities like anger, hatred, pride, lust and fear are given up; gossip and worry are to be set aside. Sattvic life-style includes devotion to the Divine or to truth, compassion, and service to humanity, study of spiritual teachings, reverence for spiritual teachers, and the practice of yoga and meditation.
<br /><br />Diet and Herbs 
<br />Diet is the most important long-term physical remedial measure. Its effects take time to manifest, often one six months, but are enduring. Our physical body is composed of food; we cannot expect its condition to change without changing our diet. Herbs are like subtle foods. They can be taken in small or large doses. Large doses (more than one ounce of herbs per day) should usually not be taken without special study or professional guidance. Right nutrition is not only taking our daily bread but also taking our daily herbs. 
<br />Oils and Massage  
<br />Massage and external application of oils are necessary for most of us on a regular basis. This may be no more than applying common oil, such as sesame, to the feet or head twice a week. Oil massage nourishes the heart and calms the mind. It gives elasticity to the muscles and ligaments and strengthens the bones. Essential oils and fragrances are also an important part of life. They open the mind and heart and purify the air and aura. 
<br />Colours and Gems  
<br />The right use of colours has a harmonizing effect on the mind and emotions through the senses. Our impressions feed the mind and affect the doshas. Gems help balance the aura and harmonize the cosmic influences projected upon us through the stars. They are not merely for ornamentation but offer an additional method of atonement with the subtle energies of life. 
<br />Life Style 
<br />Life-style is probably the most important factor in physical and mental health. Right life-style does not mean suppressing our nature, but bringing out its deeper powers. In Ayurveda, this includes not suppressing our natural urges like eating, sleeping, sex, elimination, urination, sneezing, weeping, coughing, or yawning. Such factors as right relationship and right attitudes are included here, as well as right livelihood. 
<br /> Yoga and Meditation 
<br />Yoga and meditation relate to the spiritual aspect of life. According to Ayurveda the soul is the source of life and health. Disease generally indicates that we have lost contact with our soul and its creative force.
<br /><br />Each of us should perform some daily yoga and meditation. This may include yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisation, as well as meditation practices aimed at silencing the mind. It should be noted that although Ayurveda includes different remedial measures as part of the system of Vedic science, all are not specific to it.

		<document id="420374edf56eba003df7ea419d50f035" url=""><![CDATA[Nature cure Vs Modern System<br/><br/>Nature cure is a constructive method of treatment, which aims at removing the basic cause of disease through the rational use of the elements freely available in nature. It is not only a system of healing, but also a way of life, in tune with the internal vital forces or natural elements comprising the human body.
<br /><br />The modern methods of nature cure originated in Gemany in 1822, when Vincent Priessnitz established the first hydropathic establishment there. With his great success in water cure, the idea of drugless healing spread throughout the civilised world and many medical practitioners from America and other countries became his enthusiastic students and disciples.  
<br />Nature cure is based on the realisation that man is born healthy and strong and that he can stay as such by living in accordance with the laws of nature. Fresh air, sunshine, a proper diet, exercise, scientific relaxation, constructive thinking and the right mental attitude, along with prayer and meditation all play their part in keeping a sound mind in a sound body. 
<br />Nature cure believes that disease is an abnormal condition of the body resulting from the violation of the natural laws. Every such violation has repercussions on the human system in the shape of lowered vitality, irregularities of the blood and lymph and the accumulation of the waste matter and toxins. Thus through a faulty diet it is not digestive system alone which is adversely affected.  
<br /><br />When toxins accumulate, other organs such as the bowels, kidneys, skin and lungs are overworked and cannot get rid of these harmful substances as quickly as they are produced.
<br />     Besides this, mental and emotional disturbances cause imbalances of the vital electric field within which cell metabolism takes place, producing toxins. When the soil of this electric field is disturbed, disease-causing germs can live in it without multiplying or producing toxins.
<br /><br />Nature Cure vs Modern System 
<br />The modern medical system treats the symptoms and suppresses the disease but does little to ascertain the real cause. Toxic drugs, which may suppress or relieve some ailments have harmful side-effects. Drugs usually hinder the self-healing efforts of the body and make recovery more difficult. Drugs cannot cure diseases; disease continues. It is only its pattern that changes. Drugs also produce dietary deficiencies by destroying nutrients, using them up, and preventing their absorption. Moreover, the toxicity they produce occurs at a time when the body is least capable of coping with it. The power to restore health thus lies not in drugs, but in nature.
<br />The approach of the modern system is more on combative lines after the disease has set in, whereas nature cure system lays greater emphasis on preventive method and adopts measures to attain and maintain health and prevent disease.Visit at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shreevedic.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.shreevedic.com</a>

<br /><br />Crystal healing unblocks the negative patterns by raising the vibrational frequency of the energy field that surrounds your body. Because healing is the process of working with the energy fields that surround your body, with the help of crystals you will have added vitality and feel whole again. 
<br />The energy field is the energy of the soul.
<br /><br />Working with the energy of the soul is the highest form of intervention you can receive. Because it is the most efficient way to identify and eliminate the root causes of both psychological and physical illness. Crystals do this by working on the body's energy centers, known as the ‘Chakras’. When the Chakras are not working correctly you will feel unwell or tied. 
<br />Crystal healing in some form or another has been practiced by almost every society on earth, many of which had deeply rooted belief systems that supported holistic ideas and methods. However, without this cultural foundation, crystal healing has largely become an area of faith and &quot;flakiness&quot;. You either &quot;believe&quot; crystals can heal or you don't, with little or no rational explanation of how it might work 
<br />These crystals were ground up and sprinkled directly on wounds, and scientist today has proved that it is an effective bactericide. Others believe crystal healing is even older, beginning in the ancient civilization of Atlantis or possibly even Lemuria. The ancient Greeks and Roman healers such as Pliny and Galen used Hematite for headaches. Pliny also used it for blood disorders. But the one common belief was the tremendous potential of healing properties that these stones contained.
