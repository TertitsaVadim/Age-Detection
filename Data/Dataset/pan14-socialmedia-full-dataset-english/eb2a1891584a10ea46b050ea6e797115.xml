I have started several myself and successfully published them for years. Make no mistake, it is hard work, but if you can meet a few key requirements you can get your magazine off the ground.<br /><br />What are those few key requirements?<br /><br />1) You need some money to do this - Every business start up needs some capital and magazines are no different. How much do you need? As little as a few hundred dollars will work (not including your printing costs) to get your first issue on the streets and/or news stands. For a projected higher end book, you will need thousands of dollars dependent on what market you are entering and how big you are going right off the bat. The key will be to learn the skills you need to publish and do the tasks yourself rather than hire an office full of workers and payroll (I will hit on those skills in a minute and talk more about cash in a minute).<br /><br />2) Equipment - At least one good computer capable of operating the various software you will need (Adobe InDesign and at least Adobe Photoshop), a good digital SLR camera like the Nikon D50 which runs about $750, a phone and a dependable vehicle.<br /><br />3) The ability to sell - Magazines big and small run off of advertisements and yours will be no different. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a solid sales strategy in place before you take on this project. I will talk more about selling further along.<br /><br />4) Creativity - You can't survive without offering something new to your readers in an attractive package and for this being creative is a necessity.<br /><br />Step #1 - Develop the Framework<br /><br />You probably have an idea of what type of magazine you want to publish but from here you need to construct some basic framework. Pick a name for your magazine carefully, make sure you are not stepping on anyone's trademark by searching the US trademark database.<br /><br />Your website's domain name is also something to consider when choosing your name. Search for open domains that match your magazine's name as closely as possible. It is okay to use a few sudo-odd takes on domains for magazines like magazinenameonline.com or magazine-name.com. Register your domain and contact a web development company that you like to start work on your magazine's new website. I personally like 22 Creative as they specialize in websites for magazines. Your website does not need to be awesome right out of the gate, just something professional that is clear about who you are and what your book is about - expect to spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands here. A website is an essential part of this process though, do not skip out on this one.<br /><br />Okay, you have a name and a website, what's next? Figure out what you are going to include in your first issue by writing out an editorial outline. Fancy name but in reality, just write out what you want to feature, how many pages you want to devote to each item and how many pages for ads you want to stash away (this will be dependent on how many ads you sell for your first issue). How many pages should your magazine be? Two factors are in play here. One is the cost of printing the magazine as it costs more to print a bigger magazine obviously, the second is how much editorial can or do you want to produce? You do not need a 100 page book your first go around so, dependent on what your competitors are doing, aim for around 50 pages for a local or lifestyle magazine and 90+ for a magazine you want to distribute on national news stands. I found that this webpage explained this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fasktechgeeks.com%2F1894%2Fwhats-difference-information-technology-management-information-systems%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://asktechgeeks.com/1894/whats-difference-information-technology-management-information-systems/</a>  website.<br /><br />Step #2 - It's Time to Produce Content<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, you do not need an army of 'journalists' to publish your first issue. I have produced content for hundreds of magazines by myself or with the help of just a handful of people, it is not that hard.<br /><br />Start with item number one on your editorial outline. Write your text first, making sure to follow basic guidelines for writing editorial (Google search it for tons of help). Have friends read the copy and get their honest opinion. Did you lose your readers attention at any point? Are your facts correct? Do you have any typos?<br /><br />A picture is worth a thousand words literally. People like pictures, big, colorful pictures and lots of them. Decide on how many pictures you need for the piece and whether or not you can take the photos yourself or if you need to buy them/license them from a stock photo service. If you can take them yourself, head out and start snapping. Take clear, in-focus images and take lots of them. You do not want to have to go back and re-shoot anything because you did not get the shot. Also, set your camera to take 300dpi images, normal smaller resolution images will not work and will look pixilated in the final product - nothing comes off as more rookie than low-res photos in magazines. Remember if you have any people in your photos, get them to sign a 'model release' allowing you to use their image in your publication. If you need to buy an image from a stock photo website, make sure you buy a 300dpi image that is suitable for printing. Expect to pay anywhere from $3 - $10 for each photo, if you encounter a website that charges more, you would be over paying.<br /><br />After you have knocked your editorial out, sleep on it and go over it yourself. Is it good? How many magazines have you seen that all regurgitate the same tired 'electronics features' of iPhones and some silly whatever that not many people care about? Lots. You have to have a new take on things if you want to see issue number 2, 3, 54, etc.<br /><br />Step #3 - Start Selling Ads Yesterday<br /><br />New publishers often fall into the trap of just focusing on the creative side of the magazine and not the sales. As an independent publisher, you have to wear both hats. Start by putting together a media kit for your new magazine. A media kit is a couple pages, printed out that act as a resume for your magazine featuring all of the details of who your magazine is for, how many you print, your distribution tactics, what ads you offer and how much they cost, etc. In the beginning most of your sales will not be because of your media kit, this is just an essential thing to have to leave with prospective advertisers. I could go on and on about how to sell ads for new magazines but if you read it, you would have to send me a pretty big check as that is closely held information by all in the industry. What I can tell you is start with a plan; call on advertisers that make sense for your magazine. It is a waste of time to try and sell an ad to Budweiser if you are a new magazine that is about quilting - it's just not going to happen. Put yourself in that business owners shoes, would you consider it?<br /><br />Now is not the time to get rich quick. You want to sell ads to pay the bills and hopefully recoup your investment and live. That means price your ad offerings in reality. For an idea of what reality is, try and find out what similar magazines in your market are charging. Do not go to low on your pricing however, believe in the value of your magazine - giving it away free almost guarantees future failure. I know of one magazine that just kept throwing money at itself, starting in new markets without first being profitable in one and to appear successful, they gave away their ad space. A couple years later and it is common knowledge in the media buying industry that no one pays for ads in that magazine ever. If a potential advertiser says they want it for less than you want to sell it for, pass on them politely and come back to them in a few months after you can prove a stronger value to justify your rate card.<br /><br />Most importantly, offer value to your advertisers. There are a gazillion different ways to do this but it all starts with you delivering a strong, readable publication on time. The old under-promise and over-deliver adage works well here.<br /><br />Step #4 - Layout Time<br /><br />It's crunch time. Layout is hardly ever pleasurable, my first issue I ever designed took me about 72 hours of work with about 6 hours of sleep in that period - not exactly what I call an awesome good time. Make sure you know how to use your software BEFORE you need to start laying out your pub. Pretty much the whole free world uses Adobe InDesign to layout their magazines. It is a reliable and easy to use program that will run you about $650 unless you can find a deal. You should seriously consider purchasing one of Adobe's Creative Suites that bundles InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. Those three programs will take you anywhere you want to go in publishing as I have been relying on them for years. Yes that is some expensive software but is essential and well worth the money if you are serious about doing this right.<br /><br />If you flip through a random magazine here and there, you will notice that a lot of them have an inconsistent layout throughout the book, meaning that the fonts and styles change every few pages or every story. If this appeals to you knock yourself out, just know that it is not a good practice to follow. You need to aim for a balanced flow with your layouts. The first page of content should be very close to the last page and not stray too far in between. Use a text font at or above 8 points and never smaller. Don't forget those pictures, lots and lots of pictures. Learn to use Photoshop to clean your photos up. I have spent at least 60 seconds with every photo I have ever placed in a magazine layout - it is a crime to run photos with zero post work done on them, just a straight up crime.<br /><br />I won't go into an InDesign tutorial, plenty of people have done that better than I can before.<br /><br />What you need to ultimately do is end up with a PDF file for each page of your magazine that you will give to your printer. Name each file a standard p01_NAME.pdf. Covers will be labeled C1, C2, etc. You will have the option to view proofs of your files before your printer fires up the press to start your job (a big chunk of what you are paying them to do). Always look at every proof of every page; once it gets put on a plate and starts laying down ink, you are locked in.<br /><br />Make sure you are happy with your printer. If you do not have a printer to print your job, start by talking to Las Vegas Printing to get a quote on your job. I recommend getting your finished magazines carton packed rather than skid packed and wrapped in plastic as this practice guarantees a percentage of waste due to not protecting the magazines on the outside of the skid.<br /><br />Step #5 - Distribution Time<br /><br />If you are starting a magazine that will have National or a large ranging distribution, head straight to one of the two major magazine distributors. I won't name them because they, in my opinion, make it very difficult for start ups to get in the game. I will leave it at that.<br /><br />If you are starting a locally distributed magazine, read on. Yes there are services that offer to distribute your magazine for you, they will do a poor job and charge you and arm and a leg for the privilege. Distribution is paramount. If no one sees, picks up or reads your magazine then it is just a waste of time, money and trees. A major part of your focus should be dialing in the best distribution strategy possible. Do not just toss magazines in front of stores, bars, etc. and expect them to take the time to place them out in a neat fashion - they will end up in the dumpster out back. Do your own distribution. Personally ask permission from each distribution spot, not only is this the right thing to do but it is a great way to get your name out there and meet a few potential advertisers.<br /><br />Step #6 - Do it again, and again and again<br /><br />The process never stops in the magazine game, it is a fight at all times. There will always be strong competition, new people looking for their share of a market and times where you feel like you are the only person that reads your magazine. But if you do not fight at all, it's a guarantee that you will not win. Good luck!

Manchester United began well, and got into an early lead in the 12th minute on the back of a goal by old war horse Scholes off a corner forced by Berbatov. It was Berbatov again who set up the goal by passing the ball, off the corner kick, to an unmarked Scholes, 25 yards away from the goal-line. The sides went into the break, with United leading by the solitary goal.<br /><br />But Fulham refused to give up and got back to level terms in the 58th minute when Simon Davies fired the equaliser. An own goal by Hangeland set Fulham back again, on 84 minutes. Three minutes later came the defining moment of the game when Duff handled the ball. Nani took the penalty and his shot came at perfect height for Stockdale in the Fulham goal to save. United were left to rue the miss as two minutes later Hangeland compensated for his own goal by scoriing Fulham's second equaliser of the game. I found that this page demonstrated this simply on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Finsuranceasking.com%2F1059%2Finsurance-company-cancel-auto-insurance-term-policy%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://insuranceasking.com/1059/insurance-company-cancel-auto-insurance-term-policy/</a>  blog post.<br /><br />For United, the result also meant that they trailed Chelsea at the top of the table, though it was fairly early in the season.<br /><br />Head to head, Manchester United hold a 12-3 lead in the last 20 league games played between the sides, with the remaining 5 matches drawn.<br /><br />In their last 10 league games, Manchester United have registered 7 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses; Fulham have won 5 of their last 10, while losing 1 and drawing the remaining 4. Of their 15 home games this season, Manchester United have won 14, and drawn the remaining one, while Fulham have won just one of their 15 games on the road, while losing 6 and drawing the remaining 8.<br /><br />In match week 31, Manchester United won 4-2 away at West Ham; Fulham beat Blackpool 3-0 at home.<br /><br />At this stage of the tournament, with just seven match weeks to go, United are clear leaders at the top of the table, and will seek to keep second placed Arsenal at bay, as they close in on a record-breaking 19th league title. Fulham will be up against a hungry Old Trafford squad, and will need more than luck to salvage any points from the game.<br /><br />Manchester United's starting eleven against West Ham had the following players: Kuszczak, Da Silva, Smalling, Vidic, Evra, Valencia, Gibson, Carrick, Park, Giggs and Rooney. Hernandez, Berbatov and Nani featured as substitutes.<br /><br />Fulham had the following men in their starting eleven against Blackpool: Schwarzer, Baird, Hughes, Hangeland, Salcido, Duff, Etuhu, Murphy, Dempsey, Zamora and Dembele. Johnson, Davies and Sidwell were used as substitutes.

If you intend to pursue a career as a novel writer, understand that it requires a great deal of patience and learning as well as a business sense. Most first-time novel writers either do not complete their novel or end up selling their novel for a meager amount of money in order to see it published. If you have just completed your first novel or intend to write and sell a novel, read the following sections to become more prepared at monetizing your novel.<br /><br />A Novel writer's salary is paid in one of the following ways. They either receive a royalty, which is a percentage of the price for which each copy sells or they earn a predetermined flat fee regardless of the number of copies sold. The royalty is decided when the writer and the publisher draw a contract and varies greatly based on the publisher and the popularity of the writer. However, the most common figures are about10 percent of the sales. In 2010, The New York Times reported that the average advance for a novel is $30,000. In order to receive any commissions, the novelist must first recoup the advance. I found that this webmaster showed this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdrumkitsreviews.com%2Fqa-music-software-issues%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://drumkitsreviews.com/qa-music-software-issues/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />In the past, publishers decided the royalty based on the actual retail price of a copy. However, these days, the novel writer's salary is a royalty based on the net price at which the books are sold to bookstores, which is the discounted rate. Though the publisher has the final say, the novel writer's salary can be increased through successful negotiation.<br /><br />Regardless of a novel writer's experience and reputation, he or she will earn a royalty based on the number of copies sold. As such, if you are a first timer and the publishers are offering a low advance and a fair royalty, there is no need to hesitate. Remember that a first timer is always a risk for publishers and that the advance is only a minor part of the royalty.<br /><br />A novel writer's salary may also be paid as a flat fee. This mode of payment is common when you are one among several writers who are writing for a series, if you are working on a licensed character, or if you are writing a TV tie-in novel. While royalties can keep you financially safe for a very long time, a single, flat chunk of fees can come in handy at times.

Deep fried fish, however, is in a league of its own and it is true that fried fish is a real comfort food. You can choose from a crispy breadcrumb coating or a crunchy batter and there are also various types of fish that suit this cooking method.<br /><br />Frying has been a popular cooking method in the South for a long time and you can serve battered, fried fish with French fries, spicy potato wedges or anything else you like. Other popular side dishes for fried fish include baked beans, creamy coleslaw or crispy onion rings.<br /><br />The Right Oil Temperature<br /><br />Most good deep fryers will have a temperature indicator on them but if yours does not, drop a bread cube into the hot oil. If it is golden brown in fifty seconds, the oil is the perfect temperature for making a deep fried fish recipe. Battering and frying fish might add calories but if your oil is at the correct temperature before you begin, this helps to keep the absorption level down. I found that this website explained this incredibly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomegymplanet.com%2Fp90x-power-90-insanity-turbo-jam%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://homegymplanet.com/p90x-power-90-insanity-turbo-jam/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />Also, do not crowd food in the deep fryer because this makes the temperature of the oil drop and increases the oil absorption, resulting in a soggy batter. Fry three or four pieces of battered fish at once, for the best results.<br /><br />Handy Tips for Fantastic Fried Fish<br /><br />Fish cooks quickly in the deep fryer. When the batter is crispy and browned, the fish ought to be cooked all the way through. Use small pieces of fish for easier handling and to ensure it cooks perfectly all the way through.<br /><br />If you are frying a lot of fish at once, you can keep the cooked fish warm on a paper towel-lined cookie sheet in a 200 degrees F oven until you have finished all the fish. You should choose a mild-flavored fish with a firm texture. Cod is a great fish to deep fry. Other possibilities include catfish and haddock.<br /><br />Recipe for Deep Fried Cod<br /><br />This is a simple recipe for fried cod. The fish comes out deliciously tender with a mouthwatering crunchy batter. This recipe makes enough crispy fried cod to serve six people.<br /><br />You will need:<br /><br />2 cups sifted all-purpose flour<br /> 1 cup milk<br /> 2 eggs<br /> 2 lbs cod fillets<br /> 2 teaspoons baking powder<br /> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil<br /> 3 teaspoons salt<br /> Vegetable oil, for deep frying<br /><br />How to make it:<br /><br />Preheat some oil in a deep fat fryer to 375 degrees F. Combine the salt, baking powder, and flour and coat the cod in this mixture. Beat the eggs with the milk and two tablespoons of oil, then mix in the rest of the flour mixture and keep beating until the batter is smooth.<br /><br />Dip the fish into this mixture then deep fry the fillets until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain the fried cod on paper towels and serve hot with your favorite side dishes.

I found that this weblog explained this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2luc3VyYW5jZWFza2luZy5jb20vMzI2L2xlZ2FsLWhlYWx0aC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtY29tcGFueS1wYXktaHVzYmFuZHMtZGVkdWN0aWJsZS1wYXkv" target="_blank">Venessa Steffenhagen</a> web post.<br /><br />So it was in medieval England. The man (it was only occasionally a woman) in the red and gold robe, black boots, tricorne hat and white breeches, clanging a bell, conveyed his information to the gentle folk of the town. And of course the people had a vested interest in hearing what he had to say. If the country was going to war with France once again and the head of the house was likely to be spirited away by a press-gang it was always helpful to know in advance.<br /><br />For those whose business is in advertising, it is significant that news brought to the towns and villages by the criers wasn't always of a strictly educational nature. He was also a useful means of announcing the news that some &quot;hooky gear&quot; was going cheap. For example during the Christmas period of 1798 the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar which had become damaged in their packet boat and this was advertised by the local bellman.<br /><br />Sadly the tidings brought by the town crier were not always welcome. It is recorded that in 1620, once again in Chester, a fight broke out between local butchers and bakers, the cause of which isn't known, following an announcement by the bellman. When it was the hesitant duty of the town crier to announce an increase in taxes his news was often badly received by the angry townspeople, and it was deemed necessary to remind them that the crier conveyed news as a representative of the monarch and that as such to cause him harm was considered an act of treason. This is thought to have been the origin of the popular saying &quot;Don't shoot the messenger&quot;.<br /><br />Bellmen still do exist in some parts of the UK today. They are formally represented by an association known as the Loyal Company of Town Criers. Any &quot;official&quot; town crier can join the company and take part in competitions that are held around the country throughout the year.<br /><br />Today of course we have a range of other means through which to introduce new information and to advertise &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cardsinthewindow.com%2Fabout.php"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardsinthewindow.com/about.php</a>]items for sale[/url], from the Internet to cards in the window of the local shop. One company in SW London has uniquely attempted to combine the two, with some success.

More and more places all the time are participating in different programs. Most government building promotes recycling by displaying recycling bins. Schools all over teach it to the children, with the good old saying &quot;reduce, reuse recycle&quot;. Many cities are encouraging this as well. Bags and buckets are supplied to people to encourage them. Yet as we continue to grow we need to look into the future as well. As what we are doing right now is great and it works, it may not be enough for the future. This is where the closed loop process comes in; it is recycling for the future. May of these programs are operational and more sprouting up all the time. With the closed loop process we have the ability to: I found that this individual described this incredibly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsZWN0cm9uaWNkcnVta2l0cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9kdWJzdGVwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb25zLXN0YXJ0ZWQtaGFuZHktaGludHMtZ3JlYXRseS1yZWNlaXZlZC8_" target="_blank">Leeanna Guith</a> web post.<br /><br />&amp;bull; Collect manufacturing scrap<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Collect end of life consumer product<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Sort, segregate and clean a mixed stream of material<br />&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Process and/or reformulate material into various forms<br /><br />As well as other things, this gives you the idea though that the closed loop program is very beneficial to our environment and those within it. It's a program that totally makes sense, which is evident by its popularity. Basically in a nut shell closed loop recycling mean to turn a can into a can. It's basically making something old back into something new again. That's very simplistic, yet that is what they do. With further implementation of this program it will expand globally I am sure. Pretty soon we will see much more of our recycling going towards more of the closed loop recycling. Yet just as our current way to recycle has proved inadequate for future needs this program will as well in time. We need to focus now on the future.<br /><br />So let's make sure we all do our part. The more we try now to improve the way we recycle the better for our future generations. One of the keys here is to lead by example. We can do this by encouraging it in the places we are. This could be work, church or activity center. Most people will follow they sometimes just need a boost. Also encourage your children to do the same. If they learn at this young age it will become habit for them. We all need to do our part for the next generation as well as the one we are in now.

We search and search for facts, figures, consenting opinions, a quorum vote - we want to be sure.<br /><br />We let analysis get in the way of success. Especially as our world accelerates around us. All that analysis puts us farther and farther behind.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - we do need to be thoughtful about our steps.<br /><br />But too much analysis holds us back. When we get so enthralled in the analysis - we lose sight of the real goal - moving forward.<br /><br /><strong>Analysis can become an Infinite Loop that leads to nowhere.</strong><br /><br />I learned about my own Analysis Paralysis this week. I had good reason. For the past two years I've been transitioning, personally and professionally. So I've been looking at so many and varied opportunities, evaluating all the options, analyzing all the paths, taking a hard look at myself and my future.<br /><br />Thanks to a friend with a very pointy shoe in my behind - I realized it was time to get over myself and get going.<br /><br />You see, I'd dedicated myself to analyzing and exploring every facet of myself and my future life. I turned that exploration into a full time gig. Yes, I took steps forward, but they were tentative, powerless. Why? Because I kept questioning and analyzing, looking for the sure thing. Instead I took myself off course with all the analysis and listening to the experts. I found that this blog demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jpa2VyZXZpZXdzaGFjay5jb20vMTI0OS93aGF0cy1wYWludC1taXhpbmctY29kZS0yMDA4LXI2LWdvbGQtd2hlZWxzLw__" target="_blank">Sonya Blasi</a> blog post.<br /><br />Who knows me better than me? No one. I know who I am, I know what I have to offer, and I know what I want in my life. I also know my purpose here on this planet.<br /><br />So what was stopping me from stepping forward? Only myself - and my analysis paralysis.<br /><br /><strong>It happens to all of us. Except for saints.<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /></strong><br /><br />I think it's human nature, this Gravity of analysis. We hang in the safety of the analysis rather than take that first step into progress. We focus on proving our path before we step into it. We want to dot ever 'i', cross every 't'. We want to be sure. And we are busy doing as we analyze - so it's not like we're standing still, now is it?<br /><br />The reality is that nothing in life is for sure. We have to take risks to move ahead - personally and professionally. That's what it's all about.<br /><br />I'm stepping up and stepping forward. The time for analysis is over. I have decided to step forward. I can tune as I go - but I'm taking the first step. I'm sitting down and defining the one or two steps forward I'll take this week - and I'm taking them. Beginning today. Right now. I'll be back on Thursday to let you know how it's going!<br /><br />What about you? Any analysis paralysis you care to ditch to move forward?

Protein powder is generally consumed immediately after exercising, or in place of a meal.  It is commonly used by both men and women in search of a better physique.  Using protein powder is one way to ensure an adequate intake of protein.  I think protein powder is a very versatile component in your nutritional plan.<br /><br />Basicly taking protein powder is a way of making sure that your body has the raw materials need to make your muscles bigger and stronger.  I personally think that this page showed this nicely on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL21vcGVkLXJlbnRhbA__" target="_blank">tiger muay thai</a> article.Pure protein powder is tasteless and some people argue it is tough just getting the stuff down.  Plus, this virtually tasteless protein powder is scientifically formulated to be bland in flavor, so you won't even notice that it's there. The best way to use protein powder is to mix it with foods or liquids where you cannot notice them, such as hot cereals, casseroles or in sauces.  Something that I've found works great for having your daily protein powder is adding it to yogurt.  Blend well, until the protein powder is completely dissolved.<br /><br />Protein powder is the most basic and fundamental of all bodybuilding and fitness supplements. This high-quality protein is perfect for the diet low in protein, people dieting, and vegetarians. Protein powder is available in many forms, with the two most popular being whey or milk based protein and soy based protein. Protein powder is essential for building muscle and it's easy/convenient to carry around with you. The best time to utilize protein powder is right after a workout.<br /><br />The most popular and highest quality protein powder is whey protein.  Undenatured whey protein powder is an easily digestible source of protein derived from cow's milk that contains no carbohydrates or saturated fats. After filtering, purifying and removing the water from the whey, a high quality protein powder is produced, free of fat and lactose. Whey protein powder is an excellent protein for everybody. A pure whey protein powder is for post workout and protein powder blends are for all day or right before bedtime.  Whey protein powder is suitable for putting into smoothies.  I have to say that the best protein powder is not cheap, but whey protein is good.<br /><br />The first thing you need to have in a protein powder is great taste.  CytoSport Muscle Milk, Chocolate Milk, Shake rates 5 out of 5 stars for best tasting protein powder.  CytoSport makes Muscle Milk in a large variety of flavors all extremely tasty so you can drink a different flavored shake for weeks!

You have the 'Fat' gene. OK, let's put that theory to rest right now.<br /><br />Go and pull out pictures of your great-grandparents. Look for evidence that your family has a 'Fat' gene. I'm betting your won't find any.<br /><br />Look back over pictures from before the 1960s and earlier, and I'm guessing you'll have a hard time finding more than 1 or 2 people who were very heavy.<br /><br />Why is that?<br /><br />In the 60s and 70s, packaged and 'instant' foods started gaining in popularity. My mother and grandmother were just in love with these new instant products. They would just gush - &quot;Oh, isn't this great?&quot; I found that this writer demonstrated this smartly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L3RyYWluZXIv" target="_blank">muay thai training phuket</a> weblog.<br /><br />Um, No. It's really nasty.<br /><br />It would kill me. Take Shake &amp;amp; Bake for example. You still had to wash the chicken, put it in the bag with the mix, shake to coat the chicken, put in on the cookie sheet and bake it for like an hour.<br /><br />When you took it out, the chicken was sitting in a pool of grease. It had a chemical taste. It took a long time to make. AND you had to clean that horrible cookie sheet.<br /><br />So then, people started lining the cookie sheet with foil, and adding their own seasonings to 'doctor' it up.<br /><br />What time did this save? It made no sense to me! It still doesn't.<br /><br />Since that time, obesity, type II diabetes, heart disease and cancer have sky-rocketed. See any connection here?<br /><br />People are filling their bodies with toxic chemicals, and have reduced or nearly eliminated the foods that provide the nutrients we need to stay thin and healthy. We have seen a society that continues to become fatter and sicker.<br /><br />You don't have a 'Fat' gene. That was made up to sell you more drugs to take care of your problem.<br /><br />Your family may very well be overweight, and it may appear that this runs in the family. What actually runs in the family are the eating habits you were raised with. The members of your family all have the same eating habits. People in thin families all have the same eating habits.<br /><br />You might have one member in a thin family who tends to snack and eat more bad foods than the others. You might have one weirdo in a heavy family who eats healthier. Its not some mysterious difference in their DNA.<br /><br />You may still not believe it. But it costs nothing to test it out for yourself - and it certainly won't hurt you. Take this challenge -<br /><br />Simply remove packaged foods from your diet, and add 5 - 9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. That's it. Just those 2 little things. See what happens. <br />&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold up - not so fast! As much as you want to dive in head first, you need to take baby steps and take it slowly at first. Your body will thank you later by helping to prevent any possibility of an injury from occurring. Know your body's limitations and listen to it when it's telling you something.<br /><br />If you typically have had knee or back problems avoid harsh exercises that strain those areas. I think that this website demonstrated this smartly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2NoaWEtc2VlZHM_" target="_blank">muay thai thailand visa</a> blog post.You must acknowledge your weaknesses and strengths and tailor your exercise program to meet those requirements. Men tend to do better with activities focusing on weight lifting and nautilus machines, whereas women excel with exercises that incorporate more diagonal planes of motion such as Pilates, yoga, or spinning. Women are at greater risk for ACL injuries. The ACL is the ligament that holds the knee bone in place. Therefore, women should be more careful when participating in quick leg movement sports such as skiing, basketball and tennis, for example.<br /><br />Another option would be to pay a personal trainer to show you the correct alignment and exercises for your body type and fitness goals. Make sure he or she doesn't push you too hard keeping your age factor and history in mind. On that note, be certain to practice age appropriate exercises to avoid any physical pains. I cannot stress the importance of warming up enough, to give your muscles sufficient time to prepare for the stress it's about to endure. If you're sore, take time to rest, as overuse and repetition will set you up for injuries such as shin splints, tendonitis, and constant muscle aches.<br /><br />If you are in a group fitness class, don't always listen to the instructor or mimic what everyone else is doing. If you don't feel comfortable with any part of the class whether it's the equipment or the physical moves themselves, sit it out or walk out. Do not feel rude or guilty - simply tell them you don't feel well, end of story. It's you who has to live with your body for the rest of your life, not them.

I think that this blog described this nicely on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tLw__" target="_blank">ThailandMuayThai</a> web post.She explained that she wasn't strictly on the program anymore, and hadn't reached her goal weight, but she still purchased the foods in hopes that it would help her to eventually lose weight. In spite of the fact that she is an intelligent person, the commercials with the svelte movie stars had half convinced her that there was some magic in the food itself!<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Stereotypes&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If you were asked to make a list of diet food, my guess is that it would include such things as celery sticks, carrot sticks, rice cakes, cottage cheese, poached fish, salads, and depending on which weight loss regimens you have been on, you might also mention cabbage soup, grapefruit, cider vinegar and even coconut oil.<br /><br />Some might include those frozen meals such as Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice, or the commercially available foods connected to diets such as Weight Watchers and South Beach Diet.<br /><br />For others, like my friend, diet food arrives at the door in the form of pre-packaged meals provided by the program they signed up for, the two most popular being Nutri-System and Jenny Craig.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;A broader meaning&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If any of these examples represents your definition of diet food, you need to get a new dictionary. While some of these foods can form part of a healthy weight loss diet, the list of diet foods can include any and all whole foods, when eaten in appropriate portions, and should always include foods that you enjoy and can eat for the rest of your life.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Narrow diet = Recidivism&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />If there is one way to insure that, even if you lose weight, you will gain it all back, it is to define the food you can eat in such a narrow way. You tell yourself that you will eat this diet food until you achieve your goal and then you will go back to eating all of the foods you really like. This kind of thinking is an absolute prescription for painful frustration and demoralizing failure.<br /><br />Thousands, maybe millions of people lose weight using this thinking, and then find themselves gaining it all back, and then some, when they stop eating so-called diet food and go back to eating normal food. Billions of dollars are spent every year on diet food, but we are still more overweight than we have ever been.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;It's time to change your thinking.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />First, stop thinking about foods in terms of diet food and normal food, and instead start thinking of healthy food versus unhealthy food. Healthy food includes fruits, vegetables-not just carrots and celery sticks, whole grains, lean meats, whole eggs, legumes, low-fat dairy products and good fats such as monounsaturated fats and even nuts and dark chocolate. This represents a huge list of foods and they all can form part of a successful weight loss plan and more importantly a successful life plan to maintain your weight once you have lost it.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Know your portions&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Next, think about the amount of food you eat and educate yourself about portion size. Most people, especially overweight people, fool themselves about how much they are eating. If you don't know what a cup of strawberries looks like, or 3 oz. of lean meat, then measure it once or twice until you do know. Ignorance is no excuse under the law or in healthy eating.<br /><br />For example, a 1600-calorie diet, the portion sizes for each day would be 1-1/2 cups of fruit, 2 cups vegetables, 5 oz. whole grains, 5 oz. lean meat, 3 cups low-fat dairy and 4 tsp. oils.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Keeping track&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Finally, keep a food diary, in which you write down everything you eat, including portions. You probably won't need to do this forever, but just until you learn eating habits that lead to a healthy weight and lifestyle.<br /><br />Recording what you eat each day has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to achieve success with weight loss. You can use a simple pen and pad of paper, one of the inspirational food journals that are on the market, or do it online at any one of several free dieting sites such as sparkpeople.com, where you can also take advantage of community support.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Make your own magic&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />In the incident mentioned above, my friend looked a bit sheepish when those boxes of programmed diet food were revealed. I understood perfectly how she felt. Who of us has not been tempted by the promises of a trim, attractive celebrity assuring that we too, can achieve the same result if we are willing to trade our dollars for some of their magic diet food?<br /><br />The good news is that we can decide to make our own magic, and instead use those dollars to choose a variety of delicious whole foods, in appropriate portions and establish habits that can bring a lifetime of looking good and feeling well.

Well, That Depends on Who You Ask These<br/><br/>Not long ago, an &quot;acquaintance&quot; of mine, and I use that term in most loosely fashion, as in about as much an acquaintance as half of the so-called friends on your Facebook Page - explained that something must be done to save the 99'ers, and I am thinking; &quot;hey the 99'ers are doing fine,&quot; but then he explained which 99'ers he was talking about. You see, he meant those individuals who had been out on unemployment for 99-weeks and would soon lose their unemployment benefits.<br /><br />Indeed, I was puzzled because, 100-weeks is almost 2-years, and we as tax-payers cannot pay people to &quot;not work&quot; forever. And while they were collecting these benefits we should have been requiring community volunteer work; coach a youth soccer team, help the elderly, or do some non-profit work hours each week as part of the deal. So, when my acquaintance said we must do something, he meant extend benefits for these 99'ers and he asked if we had talked about this in our think tank?<br /><br />Yes, we have addressed the unemployment issues, but I told him; &quot;I completely disagree with your websites' focus and ascertains. I disagree with any further extensions for unemployment benefits.&quot; Why you ask? Well, because the public, unions, employees voted for our current leadership and their economic policies and they must live with their decisions, learn their lessons.<br /><br />Indeed, I do not wish to pay more taxes for unemployment benefits, especially to people who trash entrepreneurship, free-enterprise, capitalism, small businesses - be careful what you wish for my friend, that's what I told my acquaintance. Further on a more critical point; there is a group called the 99'ers which is a Foundation for the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Byb2hvbWV0aGVhdGVyc3lzdGVtcy5jb20vNjAvY291c2luLXB1cnN1ZS10aGVhdGVyLWNvc3R1bWUtZGVzaWduLXRoZWF0ZXItc2V0LWRlc2lnbi10b3Atc2Nob29scy8_" target="_blank">action</a> of fallen highway patrolmen also. It's called the &quot;11-99 Foundation&quot; but the nickname is 99'ers.<br /><br />There is also a group of Women in Aviation, with an HQ and museum in OKC called the 99'ers, I've been there. It is an organization that I fully support and have also visited their museum. I also have close family friends who fully support women aviators, and two who were WASPS in WWII. I am all in when it comes to the 99'ers, that is to say the actual 99'ers group of women aviators. But I cannot support more money for extending unemployment benefits to the 99-weekers any longer.<br /><br />By allowing politicians to banter around the term 99'ers in the media is actually hurting the brand-names of both those organizations with causes that are not within the scope of their endeavors. Let's call these unemployed folks the 24'monthers instead, that's two-years my friend, let's put this into perspective. Look, no offense to anyone who is unemployed, but I am not for extending unemployment benefits, because it goes against that; &quot;teach a man to fish, don't give a man a fish&quot; principle.<br /><br />To me it's common sense. I do not want my tax dollar supporting a program that will only make people dependent on the state. That goes against evolution, human decency, and fundamental tried and true principles of human motivation. You see, I am not a liberal-socialist. I am a freedom loving, free-market man, who believes in liberty and the individual.<br /><br />Look we have unemployment growing because of bad government policy, and shelling out more money is going to drive us into a no-win Venezuela, Argentina-like economic catastrophe. In fact, why don't we just send &quot;grow-marijuana-at-home&quot; free kits to all unemployed people and take the money we were going to give them and send 60% of it to the Chinese, 25% to the Middle East, and save the 15% to pay down the debt on the Obama Stimulus? This would have the same effect.<br /><br />Here is the deal, if we really want unemployment to come down, we could merely give $12,000 per person that a small businessman hires with the restrictions that the individuals must be employed there for 6-months. Piece of cake, and it sure beats those $1.2 million dollars per shovel ready jobs they got out of their last stupid economic saving promise. Please consider all this.
