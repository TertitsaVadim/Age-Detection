<br /><br /><strong>2 - Having identity online</strong>

<br /><br /><strong>3 - Switch off your computer when not in use</strong>
<br /><br />Switching your computer off is not just a way to save energy but it also prevents others from using your computer without permission.

Instead, a spyware’s intent is to gather information about you and your browsing habits thus making it possible for hackers to access important information that they can use. Key loggers monitor your online habits carefully and collect information that they can now use for whatever intent they see fit. It can cull passwords, bank details and other data which they can use to assume your identity to conduct fraudulent transactions in your behalf or alter your desktop and add complex and unwanted toolbars on your browser. The access that one can get through spyware is potentially infinite, especially if your computer is not equipped with a proper virus protection tool. 
<br /><br /><strong>Computer Virus or Spyware- Which one is most harmful?</strong>
<br /><br />Between both, the one that can cause most damage to your computer and be more harmful for your network is difficult to assess. One thing is for sure however, both are dangerous for your computer and to ensure that you keep enjoying the ideal level of security while online, you have to safeguard yourself against both by installing <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbW11bmV0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">top antivirus software</a></strong> that can monitor and prevent potentially malicious attacks.
