One of the scouts informs him of a young Iraqi striker who he thinks will turn out to be a true superstar. The Liverpool manager flies to Baghdad to watch him and is suitably impressed and arranges for him to come over to Anfield. 
<br /><br />Two weeks later Liverpool are 4-0 down to Chelsea with only 20 minutes to go. The manager gives the young Iraqi striker the nod and on the field he goes. 
<br /><br />The lad is a sensation, scores 5 in 20 minutes and wins the game for Liverpool. The fans are delighted, the players and coaches are delighted and the media love the new star. When the lad comes off the pitch, he phones his mum to tell her about his first day in English football. 
<br /><br />'Hello mum, guess what?' he says. 'I played for 20 minutes today, we were 4-0 down but I scored 5 and we won. Everybody loves me, the fans, the media, they all love me'. 
<br /><br />'Wonderful,' says his mum. 'Let me tell you about my day. Your father got shot in the street, your sister and I were ambushed and beaten and your brother has joined a gang of looters while you were having a great time!' 
<br /><br />With this news, the young lad is very upset. 'What can I say mum, except I'm so sorry'. 
<br /><br />'Sorry!' exclaims his mum. 'It's your fault we all moved to Liverpool in the first place.'

<br /><br />For those of you who don’t know, my father has a lesser known form of dementia and has been deteriorating steadily (with the occasional but predictable spurt) for months. 
<br /><br />We were forced to arrange permanent care for him  which was the hardest thing I have ever done.
<br /><br />I joke with my children (because their mother refuses) that I want them to shoot me if I get like this.  The Princess (8) wants to know where the keys to the gun cabinet are NOW and can she have shooting lessons - but then she is going on 32.  The boy (15 going on 6) is more laid back – I think he wants to see me suffer and gloat and choose the worst possible home because I have been trying to make him do his homework for so many years.
<br /><br />Anyone think they will miss me when I go?? – best laugh I have had in weeks….
<br /><br />Happily – my best friend – and a shooting partner of many years HAS stepped up and offers to pull the trigger when the time comes.   He is a few years older than me so I worry he will a) forget where the keys are - <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> MISS!
<br /><br />I am not happy that I blogged this – it’s a very personal thing but I had to get it off my chest and try at least to raise a smile – you have to or you would weep – I know because tonight I did.
<br /><br />Please don’t feel obliged or even moved to respond to this.   Unless you have been here you wont understand and I pray (despite not being overtly religious) you never will.
<br /><br />Really – please don’t say ‘owt.  Just cut me some slack.

<br /><br />It got me to thinking.....yes I know....it doesnt happen often but I went through the list....having worked in vehicle leasing and contract hire for 10 years the list is not short....it got me to thinking it might be interesting to compile a database of vehicles and score them like a 'Which' survey but conducted amongst you lot - a kind of voxpop.....I think we would all applaud the passing ov vinyl seats - yep guys -how many times has THAT happened huh?  Couldnt be much fun for the ladies either I imagine!! 
<br /><br />Range Rovers are excluded from the poll - its not hard, clever or big (theres a joke there too).  Dont want to see any Rover 75's because you will just be lying!!!  ANYONE WHO CLAIMS THE ROVER WILL HAVE TO PROVE IT BEFORE A COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SELECTED MEMBERS OF MY FRIENDS LIST AND SPECIAL GUEST ADJUDICATOR - STAN COLLIMORE.
<br /><br />Anyway....I hope you are prepared to play/contribute and restrict yourselves to half a dozen (I know it will be difficult for some of you- no names no pack drill)
<br />It will also be an unscientific poll because the situation/location/other person will undoubtedly influence your score.
<br />List please in descending order and score out of 10.
<br />Its only fair i kick this one off so here goes:
<br /><br />1.  Triumph Vitesse (2.00 TC - Plum)
<br />2.  Fiat 124 saloon   (green)
<br />3.  Mini Van   (Teal Blue) (doors ajar - I am 6'!!)
<br />4.  Peugeot 405 (white - diesel as it happened but fuel unimportant)
<br />5.  Granada Scorpio   (Sphinx Gold)
<br />6.  Volvo 480 (Flame Red)
<br /><br />Would also offer the Volvo 740 sal OR estate as an extra - saloon or estate doesnt matter - the bonnets are the same height.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Already the data is throwing up some interesting facts.  With the exception of the 405 which was the model previous to the current one - WHAT????- they are all older models and NO german marques.
<br /><br />This tells us that modern car makers have no passion and what we all knew already - the germans had no passion to begin with*.
<br /><br />We should all lobby car makers to factor into their designs the ability for our childrens children and their children to savour the joys of having no where else to go (at least when its cold or raining)
<br /><br />Please feel free to join me in this journey down memory lane.....(stopping off in the layby on the right strictly optional but please take your 'litter' home with you)
<br /><br />*the last German I can think of with passion was called Adolph so it should be discouraged in all teutonics.

<br /><br />I was due for a cancer smear with the doctor later in the week.
<br />Early one morning, I received a call from the doctor's office to tell me that I had been rescheduled for
<br />that morning at 9:30am. I had only just packed everyone off to work and
<br />school, and it was already around 8:45 am. The trip to his office took about 35
<br />minutes, so I didn't have any time to spare.
<br />As most women do, I like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when making such visits,
<br />but this time I wasn't going to be able to make the full effort. So, I rushed
<br />upstairs, threw off my pyjamas, wet the facecloth that was sitting next
<br />to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in that area tomake sure I was at
<br />least presentable. I threw the facecloth in the clothes basket, donned some
<br />clothes, hopped in the car and raced to my appointment.
<br />I was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when I was called in. 
<br />Knowing the procedure, as I'm sure you do, I hopped up on the table, looked 
<br />over at the other side of the room and pretended that I was in Paris or some 
<br />other place a million miles away. I was a little surprised when the doctor
<br />said, 'My, we have made an extra effort this morning, haven't we?' I didn't
<br />respond........
<br />After the appointment, I heaved a sigh of relief and went home. The rest of 
<br />the day was normal - some shopping, cleaning, &amp; cooking.
<br /> After school when my 7 year old daughter was playing, she called out from the bathroom,
<br />'Mummy, where's my facecloth?' I told her to get
<br />another one from the cupboard.
<br />She replied, 'No, I need the one that was here by the sink, it had all my 
<br />glitter saved inside it.'
<br />NEVER going back to that doctor ever!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />)

<br /><br />Having explained to Paddy what they do they sent him off.
<br /><br />The idea appealed to Paddy so much   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" /> he decided to make that his first call....he found the address his pals had given him and rang the bell.
<br /><br />The kindly hooker who opened the door in her silk robe (dont say it!!) could see that Paddy was nervous.
<br />&quot;This your first time deary??&quot;  &quot;Yes&quot; spluttered Paddy  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />.  She led Paddy gently by the hand  with a promise she would take care of him  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br /><br />Closing the bedroom door she turned to Paddy and slipped of the robe to reveal herself naked but for a pair of crotchless panties!!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Gently stroking herself she cooed to Paddy &quot;Would you like some of this??&quot;

<br />She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one.
<br /><br />I honestly answered, &quot;No, this is my first time.&quot;
<br /><br />So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.
<br /><br />&quot;Just a minute,&quot; she said, and walked to the door, and locked it.
<br /><br />Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. &quot;Do these excite you?&quot; she asked. Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. 
<br /><br />As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. &quot;Well, come on&quot;, she said, &quot;We don't have much time.&quot;
<br /><br />So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was done within a few minutes.
<br /><br />She looked at me with a bit of a frown. &quot;Did you put that condom on?&quot; she asked. I said, &quot;I sure did,&quot; and held up my thumb to show her.
<br /><br />She fainted.

<br />If that's as far as you take your tendencies then fine, I happen to know quite a few enthusiasts who are more serious in their pursuit of happiness.  They are some of the brightest, wittiest and most interesting people I have ever known.  By association I have also come across (figuratively speaking) some exhibitionists who likewise can be clever and very nice people.  As in all walks of life there are pillocks too but you avoid them.
<br /><br />Consider for a moment Historians, Anthropologists, the media, (hands up anyone who refuses to read ‘Hello’ magazine) even people like Terry Wogan and Michael Parkinson!!  they are all interested in people, their lives, (and often intimate details of) past, present and future but not content with just gathering the information they make it available to the rest of us – often illustrated with images!!.
<br /><br />Without hungry consumers (us) they would all be out of a job. So, unless the leap is too great for some of us to make, one could argue that in providing these facts (and pics!) they are only a short step away from pornographers!!  Anyone feeling uncomfortable yet??  Well don’t!  We cant help it – and neither should we feel ashamed.  Remember Desmond Morris and his ‘Manwatching’ books?? Just manuals for peeping toms.
<br />Does anyone else apart from me love to sit in a waiting room or restaurant – motorway services are my favourite – and watch people ??  Wonder where they’ve come from and going to? What their relationship is – often obvious. What mood they are in and study their body language.  Like it or not that too is voyeurism.  Isn’t it great?  
<br /><br />Now before you drop off read on……it gets a LOT more interesting, and then consider the simple question at the end.
<br />Answers and/or comments on a postcard please……
<br /><br />Last Tuesday (10 October 2006) I was staying at a well known training venue near Bristol with one of my colleagues.  We were running a workshop.
<br /><br />I went to bed fairly early as we had an early start the next morning.
<br />The room was unbearably hot so I opened the windows and the curtains to get as much fresh air as possible.  Too hot to sleep properly I got up around midnight and sat by the open window for a smoke (non smoking room) and some cooling air.
<br /><br />A light came on in a room across the way and a floor below mine.  I could see a bloke walking round the room talking into a mobile phone.  I took no notice until further movement and a flash of colour caught my eye.  It was a very pretty young blonde woman in a lovely smart bright red party dress – strapless. 
<br /><br />For a second I mused over whether they were a couple or whether he had ‘pulled’.  It was late and we all know that delegates are seemingly infected with a bug as soon as they enter conference/training venues which makes them check in their morals at reception.  Further movement made me look again. A third male, and a fourth!  I had finished my smoke at this time and should have returned to bed but something made me stay ?. The main light in the room was turned off at this point but more than enough light from the bedside lamps and spilling from the bathroom remained to show the second and third guys begin to undress.  One down to the waist, the other down to his socks!! 
<br /><br />The room being at about 2 o’clock from mine, half of it was hidden but being a floor below the field of view was pretty extensive.   
<br /><br />Mr ‘completely nekkid apart from me socks’ (No style) sat on the end of the bed with head turned, talking or looking.  The girl then re-appeared and went to the other guy who sat on a chair in front of the window.  She knelt in front of him and began to speak with him.  She got up and disappeared again.
<br /><br />Bloke on the end of the bed then stood and turned around.  The only thing I saw of the girl for the next few minutes was her head – intermittently!  The standing bloke was mostly visible – the bit that wasn’t was also intermittent! 
<br />For those that are not getting the gist of what I am saying here I can draw you a picture if required!
<br />During this period I saw nothing of the first guy with the phone but the next time he appeared he was going into the bathroom – naked - so I have a good idea where he had been!
<br /><br />As guy #2 got dressed again, the girl – impersonating a sports convertible (she had her top down) – knelt in front of the shy guy for another minute but finally gave up and he put his shirt back on and he and his late arriving friend left the room.
<br /><br />At this point the woman in red stood in front of the window and slipped off the dress and smoked a cigarette (god bless her) I couldn’t help noticing she was either a natural blonde or a smooth hound (that’s a fish by the way - a small relative of the shark). 
<br />I hope no one saw her – the venue would not be pleased she was smoking in the room!!!
<br />The next few minutes they walked around a little (thanks lord) and then it looked as though they had an argument.  Then they disappeared and it looked as though they made up again. She then appeared briefly, put on a robe and the lights went out…?
<br /><br />I have no idea how long I had sat at the window but I was out of cigarette papers and was shivering with the cold!!
<br /><br />The key learning points for me that night were:
<br />•	Get glasses fixed
<br />•	Never go anywhere again without binoculars/camera/camcorder
<br />•	The focal length of a phone cam sucks 
<br />•	If it happens again (yeah right!) put a coat on.
<br /><br />I was a wreck the next day at breakfast, lunch and dinner trying to identify the young lady – I wanted to congratulate her and thank her at the same time.  There were 7 young blondes in 2 groups who she could have been,- right hair colour/length.  My attempts to spot her were of course hampered by the fact she was fully clothed and not kneeling!  I was sorely tempted to shout out if anyone owned a red party dress!  what would I do if several said yes? Ask if they wore it briefly last night and did they have plans to take it to the dry cleaners when they got home?
<br /><br />Before anyone begins to imagine I am making this up I swear on the lives of my children it happened precisely as described.
<br /><br />I also feel not the slightest guilt for watching – hell they could have closed the curtains if they didn’t want anyone to see – for all I know they could have sold tickets to all the rooms opposite!
<br />I would venture the world would be divided on this – half would watch and enjoy and be honest – the other half would be lying.
<br /><br />I have had some interesting responses from the people I have told – and I have told LOTS of people!
<br />The strangest/saddest was a bloke who was clearly shocked.  Not at the fact of it but that I was willing to admit to watching and enjoying and that I told my wife about it!!!  That is sooo sad.
<br /><br />Two from women I have told were ‘lucky cow!’
<br /><br />Who amongst you would have watched too??  Come on be brave!!
<br /><br />Since I wrote this and blogged it first time I have had another comment – very sad but very funny…..
<br />A friend wrote…..” that’s DISGUSTING……I didn’t realize you SMOKED!!”

<br /><br />I come here to relax and chat to intelligent grown ups.  I come across enough stupid people in real life so I will not allow them to invade my private life.  
<br />………………………………………………………………………………………………
<br /><br /><strong>To whom it may concern:</strong>
<br /><br />I don’t know who the hell you think you are but I don’t need anyone to plead my case to make you forgive me (by inference) thank you very much!!  Why on earth I thought I might want you as a friend I can’t imagine!    
<br /><br />I am so angry at your arrogance my hands are shaking!!!
<br /><br />Neither am I interested in swapping private messages with you from people! 
<br />I am sure some of them would  “make interesting reading”  but a message I send in private stays there and I suggest you should regard them the same – the clue is in the word PRIVATE!! 
<br /><br />That just about sums up why so many bright people don’t last in here or many other sites of this nature for very long – some people just cant do without causing drama and people like you drive them away!!   The one thing up with I will not put is drama and drama queens!!
<br />It is actually a condition recognized by psychologists you know.  I read an article a while ago about Psychic Vampirism – as I don’t want you biting my psychic neck thanks I am cancelling our ‘friendship’ and after say 24 hours to give you the courtesy you wouldn’t extend to me to reply I am going to block you.
<br /><br />In addition:  if  “it is easy for me to rip people Mike in every way”. Is in any way a threat and if I hear of a single word you print about me again in this site or anywhere else for that matter or suspect you are tramping through my pages under a false ID I will first of all have you banned from here for the personal and unprovoked attack you made on me and then I will take legal action against you.  If you don’t believe me give it a go!!
<br /><br />I really don’t mind if you talk about me, it’s kind of flattering and sad at the same time and if you can find anyone barmy enough to listen then they need to get a life too.  
<br /><br />I hope this makes my position clear.  If you are inclined to reply forgive me if I don’t answer it – I am bored with all this crap now.
<br /><br />Now sod off you plank!!!
<br /><br />………………………………………………………………………………………………
<br />Apologies to anyone else foolish to read this.  Those of you who know me well enough hopefully will appreciate how angry all this bullshit has made me.
<br />I don’t normally argue with stupid people – it’s like fighting a one armed man – not fair - but I had to do this.
<br />I feel much better now!  I think we should all have a sweep through our friends list from time to time and clear out all the dross.........

She researched on the internet the ways to bring her life to an end and chose to shoot herself in the heart.....Wikidaedia gave her the location of her heart as an inch below her left breast.
<br /><br />The local paper reported the next day a woman in her 80's admitted to casualty with gunshot wounds to her left knee!!!!
