For case, Siegel cites that stocks and options, on average, are currently for a 12 to 13 P/E ratio in a zero interest rate environment, which is well below the historical long-term P/E ratio of 15 which reversion or adjustment back to the mean could alone carry the Dow to help 15, 000. Siegel further said that Dow 15, 000 is &quot;really rather modest&quot; because all you have to to get there are two additional years involving 8% returns, so with 13, 000 up 8% to roughly 14, 000 in the first year, and then up another 8% to help roughly 15, 000 inside second year. He also thinks a great 8% annual increase should be slightly above long-term normal appreciation with the Dow which has over time been about 6. 5% annually. <br /><br />Siegel then gets even more bold and says he sees a 50/50 chance that Dow could hit 15, 000 by year-end 2012 based on momentum he sees building up for the overall design. And he raises the opportunity of hitting Dow 15, 000 to help 70% by year-end 2013. Which means that, let me condense this, Siegel says there can be a 50% chance that the Dow could end 2012 with 15, 000 and a 70% chance which it could end 2013 with 15, 000; pretty striking, he's not hedging his statements excessive here. Siegel sees the Euro zone crisis for a primary drag available but is pretty sure that the European Central Traditional bank will ultimately provide liquidity to nations susceptible to defaulting on their debt payments and therefore a Lehman-type crisis will be averted. He also believes that the strong and growing economy could sustain higher interest rates should the Fed start raising rates in the low, low levels they are currently at. And, as investors see that will there's been little volatility in the market over the past three years and that the economy is collecting, they will start to re-enter this market and drive stocks higher as a result of increased demand, sort of the second leg up compared to a market fake available; at least that's precisely how Siegel sees it. <br /><br />Now, no one has some sort of crystal ball, not even Siegel, but some with his points are valid; that the economy appears to be getting stronger, and that the stronger economy fosters trader confidence, that many who have been sitting on the sidelines may now feel things have stabilized and therefore it's safer to reunite into stocks, that P/E ratios could move back to their historical average of 15, which simply translates that stock prices will improve, and that a stronger economy will tolerate gradually rising interest rates. That said, with Iran saber-rattling, petroleum prices could rocket higher and an oil dilemma, for example, could upend their model. <br /><br />With regard to my listeners, the crux is actually this: Siegel sees the economy in the U. S. slowly becoming stronger, he sees commercial uncertainty declining, and expects increased investor confidence fueling an additional leg up in the market.
