<br />I wrote a story in English and i want all of your opinions.
<br /><br />here it is
<br /><br />He stood on the edge of the cliff…
<br /><br />He was tempted by the urge to destroy what was left of his pathetic sorry life. He had lost the love of his life, she was the only person he cared about, she was the only thing worth living for and now that she had left him, he couldn’t bear to be alone. He couldn’t bear to see her with another guy, he couldn’t see himself moving on from her and loving someone else the way he loved her. She made his life so wonderful so joyous that nothing could stop him feeling the way he did about her, you could almost say he was “High” on her love. Ever since that crucial heartbreaking day, each day is burning him because he realises his mistakes, but the realisation has come too little too late to save their relationship. So he stands alone atop the cliff top, with the cold desolate wind running through his untidy, long brown hair, pondering on how to end his life.
<br /><br />He looks to his left and sees their first kiss and when he gently touches his lips the action reminds him of the lustful indescribable feelings of how their lips used to lock together. The connection almost forming one person. Swept up in the love and compassion, and focuses on all the emotions he had for her and still does. He looks to his right and sees all the pain and suffering she caused him, making him feel so cold so alone. These past weeks have been a living hell. Constant nights of waking up and stressing out, believing that it’s all a dream. He can’t stand it anymore, the pain is overwhelming, and it’s burning him alive, torturing his soul with every glance and every spoken word from her seduces him into believing that they can work it all out.
<br />But then reality sinks in and he feels the hurt and suffering return once more. All he wants is to hold her again, to protect her from all the evils of the world, to lock his lips with her once more would make all the pain and despair go away. Some call it depression, others call it pathetic, but he calls it loosing the love of his life, the one thing he could only truly love like no other. He looks down and sees the cold, hard but benevolent rocks below constantly being slapped by the aggressive misty grey waters. His pained blue eyes look out towards the concealed horizon and notices the rain, weeping across the ocean just like the tears that stain his face leaving everlasting marks.
<br /><br />Vivid memories return once more like a slideshow in front of his eyes, he sees Valentine’s Day last year. When he first kissed her on the lips surprisingly, the feelings he felt just as his lips stop touching hers, five seconds felt like forever. He looks northward and sees the first time they made love, how romantic it was. With the rain falling outside, the endless hours of pashing. That night they both gave each other something that they couldn’t give anyone else, their virginity. He remembers everything about that night, the way she looked at him with her beautiful blue eyes piercing right to the very depths of his soul, the sight of her naked flesh still gives him this indescribable feeling , the sight of her was just plain gorgeous.
<br /><br />And then just like that it was gone, he feels sick. The vomit inside just surging upwards, into his oesophagus, and finally out and over the cliff. He doubles over in pain, now crouching on the ground. He wipes the rest of the vomit off from around his mouth. The reminder of the vomit still burning his throat. He rolls over onto his back, he cries. He’s thinking to himself, why didn’t I correct my mistakes sooner? Why didn’t I stand up for her when I had the chance? It would have shown her that I really do love her. Why did I talk to that stupid skanky bitch the way I did? This is all my fault and only I can correct the situation. He knows on the outside and into the very depths of his soul, he knows he didn’t cheat on her, but because of another’s malicious, scandalous words he can’t prove otherwise in her eyes. But he has proved her wrong, she just doesn’t know it yet.
<br /><br />The day has grown long, he has stood there for hours, His knees hurt like hell they are weak just like him. But the pain in his knees is nothing compared to the pain in his heart. He remains undecided as to whether he should end this heartbroken tragedy. Maybe by falling from the cliff or by some other means. He hears a noise behind him as if expecting someone, that particular someone who caused him his heartache. But he’s so confused, he doesn’t know what to do. It pains him to make a decision and he must make it soon. He remembers that he made a note for her to read on his car. It read
<br />Baby…
<br />I loved you once, I love you still,
<br />I always have and always will…
<br /><br />A tear from the purest of love means the world to one man but means the universe to me!
<br /><br />Never forget me babe because even when I’m gone I’ll always be with you. I love you forever
<br />Love your
<br />Prince
<br /><br />In the distant background, he could hear a car pulling up. He didn’t really care. But he turns and faces the sound. It is the person who he loves/fears. He is lost for words, she looks at his tear stained face and he notices that she has been crying as well. He doesn’t know what to do. It feels like forever, but its actually only five minutes before either of them speaks. She communicates in her soft voice, “I found the note on your car, please don’t do it. Don’t kill yourself because of me, you will find someone else”. His physical display of emotion says everything, He just looks at her with his pained staken blue eyes glazed over with a tear’s veil. She walks towards him, he feels insecure almost violated within her presence. All he can do is stand there and take it, otherwise he is forced to fall from the cliff. He pleads with her, Please take me back I love you like no other I want to be your prince, and I want you to be my princess. She sighs deeply and repeats, I’m sorry but I don’t want to be hurt again, I don’t want to be burnt. I sill love you though. Do you understand?
<br /><br />“I love you too but for this I’m sorry” He answers, she looks at him in horror, eyes widened, lips trembling, hands shaking. He takes a step back. She tries to grasp him. But it’s too late. He is falling now, he embraces the impact awaiting him, but the whole time he is falling, he’s looking at her smiling saying “I love you princess. She’s staring at him in sheer horror, She screams. It’s all too much, seeing her one true love falling to his death. She whispers back, I love you too. She closes her eyes and tears fell towards her lover, but all she heard was a spine tingling crunch that echoes throughout the area. She opens her eyes, swollen and full of tears as she leaps up and sprints down to the foot path using the cold alone steel guide rails as her only means of support. She arrives next to his body. She knows he is alive but dying rapidly.
<br /><br />With his dying breath, he tells her that he loves her and he will always look out for her. Her tears are falling onto his chest, he gives her a dying smile and says, don’t cry for me babe, I’m always here (he points to her heart) and please don’t forget me. He coughs and blood trickles from the corner of his mouth. She whispers I love you and bursts into tears. I’m always yours and you are always mine, forever babe you and I. She screams out in agony. He is gone, the heartache and the pain has left him, he has made his peace. He died because of love, but he lives on in her heart.
<br /><br />please leave comments.

<br />hope you enjoy it.
<br /><br />That smell jogs my memory…
<br /><br />I was walking from the shop per usual every night as I would, bringing home the food which was Chinese takeaway with soft drink and lollies. I was daydreaming whilst I walked, then out of nowhere a black SUV screamed past nearly colliding with me “Fucking idiot” I yelled at it with anger. I kept walking, only one block left till I arrived to my place when I heard familiar yelling and screaming with 3 gunshots, I ran all the way home to where I heard it all dropped the food and put my right hand on the holster of my gun, yes I was a police officer.
<br /><br />When I walked through my families front door that had been smashed in I was at disbelief, there was broken items everywhere, our family portrait smashed, I walked into the living room and burst into to tears there was my darling mother diane, shot in the chest with I presumed a shotgun, then I heard yelling it was my brother Mat, he was upstairs. As I rushed upstairs the was a gunshot again, silenced the night air. He was bound and gagged to a chair, there was a bullet wound that has penetrated his stomach. He said with his dying breathe “get those bustards!” I heard a deepened muffle from a man yelling to another to hurry up, I look out mats window. There was a tall man with black gear on balaclava, black shirt vest, black pants and sneakers. I looked out onto the road there it was! That same SUV that nearly hit me before!!! I was so angry I wanted them to pay. I heard a scuffle break out downstairs it was my father, John yelling for me. I rushed back downstairs to be confronted with all 3 men. One of which had my father at gunpoint, He said with a deepened voice “This is what you get when your precious brother doesn’t deliver!” Thoughts were running through my head what the hell was he on about??? Then, I remember the most painful sight anyone could ever witness, the sight of a loved ones heart being pierced with a bullet. It hurt I lunged at the main leader only to be thrown back with a shotgun shell unloaded into my shoulder, that cold lead penetrating my flesh it burned so intensely I could barely move. I was then belted around for several minutes, they really must have got their kicks out of dealing pain out to others. The smell of blood burned my nostril it was so pungent so vile. I blanked out but with my last breathe I said to them I stated “I will get my revenge you bustards!!!”
<br /><br />I woke up in a hospital bed, those images came flooding back to me. My mother cold and pale with a tricklet of blood from her mouth. My brother gagged and bound to that chair, blood oozing from the side of his eyes. Blood mixing with tears of pain. I could tell in his eyes he knew something he didn’t want me to know. And my father the way he stared at me willing to give his life to spare mine. I just broke down in tears then the pain came back to me of my shoulder of my head. I received 30-40 stitches on my left shoulder and I had to get back on my feet ASAP. To hunt down the bloodthirsty animals that took my family away from me. The nurse walked in, she was overcome with shock that I was out of bed. She scorned me to get back to bed to rest. I told her “NO!” I  have to be moving about I need to get these… these cold blooded basturds for what they did to me. She saw how much I hurt and comforted me. Day by Day she helped me get the feeling back in the shoulder. I was out in a couple of weeks after one final test. I had lost some of the sorrow because in my heart I had found an indescribable feeling that had taken me. It was love.
<br /><br />I was back at the police station when my boss walked up to me and said “Are you sure you want to be doing this, so soon?” I had to for my murdered family. It took me weeks to realise but I had found out that my little brother had been into drugs. Not taking them just selling. He had made one single mistake, he forgot to give the money back. I mean how could you forget to give $116,000 back to a guy. But not just any guy. This was Jerry Maxim, a notorious drug king pin with enough committed crimes to put him away for a lifetime and then some!. I was walking back to my apartment later that same night, running things through my head. Why did he do it? WHY?. When I had a visitor, it was the nurse from the hospital. She had come around because she said she was lonely. She looked gorgeous in the outfit she had on. Nice slim lined dress. We walked inside. One thing lead to another and you can imagine what happened next….. 
<br /><br />Next morning I woke up with Naomi (the nurse) she was asleep I got up out of bed when a rather loud knock on the door. I chucked some clothes on and grabbed my gun ( Just in case!) I looked out the window and gasped with horror. It was the same SUV that was at my place that night, the memories burned into my heart, how could I forget everything that happened. I looked towards the front door and it got worse. 3 men all in black with balaclava’s on. I quickly rushed to the bedroom to wake Naomi up. She woke up with resilience I told her to hide very well. Things were about to get ugly. I crept up to the front door and the men yelled (pretending to be delivery men) “Hurry up mate we aint got all day” No sooner had they said theat,I unleashed a round of burning hot lead through that door piercing one of them in the throat, blood splattering everywhere. He gurgled, as blood spilled from his throat. 
<br /><br />The other’s ducked and returned bursts of bullets back into the house. I rushed to the kitchen to grab something sharp. I grabbed a butcher’s knife, only to turn around to see both of them in the doorway. One rushed at me with a knife also. He slashed my cheek, blood gushed from my open wound, I didn’t care there was so much anger and hatred that burned inside of me. It felt as if the pain never existed. I lunged at him, embedding the knife into his cold heart. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. The final man stood there gasping at what he had just seen. He was a coward he turned and started to run but I was too quick for him. I threw my knife at him, stuck in his back he fell stumbling around scared like a mouse being chased by the cat. My retribution was about to be fulfilled. As he stood up I said “this is for my family” one shot straight into his skull, painting the walls with his brains. It was a sicking feeling but all the hatred and anger was gone. I feel free now but just left with the sorrow of being alone without a family. But I have Naomi now so I’m going to start my own now. That is why when I smell blood it jogs my memory.
<br /><br />please comment.

<br />near the 
<br />end of his 
<br />senior 
<br />year in high school. 
<br />Unfortunately, 
<br />he still has to share a room with his 
<br />younger 
<br />brother who is only 9 
<br />years 
<br />old. 
<br /><br />One night, he decides to bring his 
<br />girlfriend home 
<br />for a little fun. 
<br />They 
<br />have bunk beds and the guy notices that 
<br />his little 
<br />brother is already 
<br />asleep 
<br />on the lower bunk, so he and his 
<br />girlfriend climb 
<br />up 
<br />to the top bunk. 
<br />As you 
<br />might expect things start to heat up. 
<br /><br />The guy remembers that his little brother 
<br />is 
<br />sleeping below so he tells 
<br />his 
<br />girlfriend to whisper &quot;lettuce&quot; if she wants 
<br />it 
<br />harder and &quot;tomato&quot; if 
<br />she 
<br />wants a new position. 
<br /><br />Lettuce!!! 
<br /><br />Tomato!!! 
<br /><br />Lettuce!!! 
<br /><br />Tomato!!! 
<br /><br />Lettuce!!! 
<br /><br />Tomato!!! 
<br /><br />She screams. 
<br /><br />Lettuce!!! 
<br /><br />Tomato!!! 
<br /><br />Whoa!!! 
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT!!! 
<br /><br />PULL IT OUT NOW!!! 
<br /><br />I can't get pregnant! 
<br /><br />Then the little brother shouts up, &quot;Hey, 
<br />would you 
<br />guys stop making 
<br />sandwiches up there! You're getting 
<br />mayonnaise 
<br />all over my 
<br />face!*!*!*!*!
