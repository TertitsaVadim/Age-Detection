<br />Give me the gift of crying, give me the will to fight
<br />I’ll stay because I love you, I’ll stay because I can
<br />But if you ever leave me, I’ll be left without a plan
<br />I wanna die beside you, want you to know I care
<br />You don’t know how much you crushed me, I’m still gonna be there
<br />I don’t care that you don’t love me, just notice I’m still here!
<br />Forgetting my existence is my one true fear
<br />Hide behind this wall of make-up, destroy the girl inside
<br />I no longer feel security, and life returns to lies
<br />Watch me destroy my freedom, and slash my happiness away
<br />I’ll try to kill myself now, and every single day
<br />Let me linger in a false reality, and when you’re feeling down
<br />Pull the world from underneath my feet, feel free to fuck around
<br />I just need some one to talk to now, just dry these fucking tears
<br />You’re not the only thing that’s killing me, you’re the thing that kept me here

<br />I’ve been left on my own again
<br />I’m not sure who I had with me
<br />I don’t know where I am right now
<br /><br />The light is over yonder
<br />Casting shadow over doubt
<br />If I tried to kill myself
<br />Would that lead me out?
<br /><br />How did I end up in this place?
<br />I can’t see where I am at all
<br />If I even try to walk
<br />Will I stumble, will I fall?
<br /><br />A sound is echoing around
<br />I’m not sure where it is
<br />It’s spooky yet it’s soothing
<br />A smooth, soft hiss
<br /><br />Water rising around my ankles
<br />Walls are closing in
<br />Darkness is consuming me
<br />This is all because of him
<br /><br />Shake the thoughts away from me
<br />Push that voice out of my head
<br />Wake up from this nightmare
<br />And forget what has been said
<br /><br />Now we live in harmony
<br />I die with every move I make
<br />His grip tightens around my neck
<br />The coiling of the snake
<br /><br />The water’s around my breastplate now
<br />Walls inches from my face
<br />Darkness gnawing at my sanity
<br />I get strangled with such grace
<br /><br />The elegance that killed me
<br />I’m sure it got me here
<br />I’m still in that dark, cold place
<br />With nothing left to fear

<br />No final cries for fame
<br />I walk the streets, blood at my feet
<br />As no one else remains
<br />A gun-shot rings, a soldier sings
<br />More life is in my head
<br />An empty place, there's not a trace
<br />Of anyone who's not dead!
<br /><br />The pain has ceased, their souls released
<br />As I trip on my own feet 
<br />If I give up, who gives a fuck?
<br />There's no one left to grieve!
<br />I'm so lonely, there's only me
<br />Did I mention I'm alone?!?
<br />I fell in love, it got fucked up!
<br />So now I'm on my own!
<br /><br />Love was great, though not of late
<br />It ended, I won't cry
<br />I loved and lost, who gives a toss?
<br />I lived, I loved, I died.

<br />You were in the wrong and you dragged me in
<br /><br />And now tears are rolling down my face
<br />Hands in fists, fallen from grace
<br />You say you hate to see me cry
<br />And then you just keep asking why

<br />You lie though it's the harder route

<br /><br />She walked the lonesome, empty streets 
<br />The rocks and stones cutting her feet 
<br />The rain pouring like shattered glass 
<br />The moon glowing yellow, like the dying grass 
<br />She tried to hold her head up high 
<br />But she couldn't bare to see the darkened sky 
<br />As the clouds unite and rebel against the sun 
<br />She's left, cold, defenseless and trodden on 
<br />Tears falling from her blackened eyes 
<br />The same mascara tears as every time she cries 
<br />As she walks alone, she cries alone 
<br />She hopes that she won't die alone 
<br />But as she drinks the noxious, crimson draught 
<br />She shudders with a cold forced laugh 
<br />And as she screams and pleads for her souls release 
<br />She dies alone, to rust in peace 
<br /><br />The lonely death of purity 
<br />These words destroy me savagely 
<br />As honest as they have to be 
<br />They out right annihilate me 
<br /><br />This poem is one to which I relate 
<br />It describes a reality I hate 
<br />But it has it's elegance all the same 
<br />It's &quot;refreshingly morbid&quot; as Darragh would say

<br />Or the lyrics of some songs
<br />I still have to sit here writing
<br />Cause those writers got it wrong
<br /><br />You see, <em>“You are everything”</em>
<br />But you are so much more
<br />The constant thought inside my head
<br />You cannot be ignored
<br /><br /><em>“I live through you, you look through me”</em>
<br />You don’t see how much I care
<br />And though the air I breathe is in your name
<br />Of my name, you’re aware
<br /><br /><em>“How does it feel to know you’re everything
<br />I want?” </em>Or don’t you know?!
<br />That anything I’ve ever dreamt of, all in one
<br />Is you alone
<br /><br /><em>“I lie awake and try so hard
<br />not to think of you&quot;</em>
<br />But the obsession is my consciousness
<br />That now, it’s all I do
<br /><br /><em>“I’ll believe all your lies
<br />Just pretend you love me”</em>
<br />Would you let me live a dream?
<br />Escape from reality?
<br /><br /><em>“All you say is sacred to me”
<br />“You’re so fucking special”
<br />“And I won’t let you give up,
<br />on a miracle”</strong></em>

<br /><br />Sitting in the same room, week after week, 
<br />This is just to make me feel weak, 
<br />It's working, I tell you, I feel inadequate, 
<br />But the elders know better, they won't let me quit, 
<br /><br />They try to make me focus on pain, 
<br />They try to take control of my brain, 
<br />I will break free, they won't take hold, 
<br />I don't need it so I won't go, 
<br />They think they know best, they think they can help, 
<br />But I know I can help myself, 
<br />I already have and now I'm fine, 
<br />So the elders are only wasting my time, 
<br /><br />The time is limited...and now it's running out, 
<br />'For a limited time only', but the time to die is now.

<br />I don't need a boy to break me 
<br />Don't have to fix myself with glue

<br />I kill myself esteem alone

<br />They won't let me just give up 
<br />Though I can't handle it all 
<br /><br />I am negative and quite unsure 
<br />Thanks to the past of all my thoughts 
<br />My friends are there to keep me strong 
<br />But I dwell on the pain my family have brought 
<br /><br />So as the guys float in and out of my life 
<br />They bring me joy for weeks, or months...

<br />&quot;I couldn't share problems and so I caused pain&quot;?
<br />I don't want solutions, I want you to hear
<br />Being forgotten is my biggest fear
<br /><br />See, what I do is read people, I look inside
<br />I can tell what you're like, and no one can hide
<br />It's uncommon that someone who never shuts up
<br />Could listen intently, sum everyone up
<br />Thus I avoid drama, and get the spotlight
<br />Attract some attention without crossing lines
<br />Please do not forget me, but don't care too much
<br />Cause any day now I'll have had enough

<br /><br />And this is what I cannot take
<br />The isolation I create
<br />The feeling that I'm so alone
<br />Though in the end I have control
<br />My mind will build a barricade
<br />A barrier you cannot break
<br />A wall that's much too tall to climb
<br />To attempt to is a waste of time
<br />As life just keeps on setting tasks
<br />I lie and hide behind my mask
<br />And then it all gets too damn tough
<br />Until I feel I've had enough
<br />So then my world comes crashing down
<br />Of course those walls fall to the ground
<br />They trap me under, crush my soul
<br />I lose my mind, I lose control
<br />My guard is down, my heart pours out
<br />This will repeat, I have no doubt

<br /><br />Darkness creeps into every corner
<br />The deepest places in my mind
<br />Throwing off my equilibrium
<br />Tortures me and I'm left blind
<br />The air is whispering to me
<br />&quot;It's just us now, my dear&quot;
<br />Her cold grip wraps around my heart
<br />Her howls are all I hear
<br />My paces are getting faster now
<br />But there is no escape
<br />My breaths are shallow, hasty gasps
<br />With tears rushing down my face
<br />Unaware of my surroundings
<br />I look back but know no more
<br />The fear acts like a barricade
<br />It's too much to endure
<br />My feet are frozen on the ground
<br />Knees cease to be support
<br />And I hit the earth with such a thump
<br />Too numb to know it's sore
<br />The tears are not an obstacle
<br />All I need to do is breathe
<br />Stand up, push through the dark air
<br />And run to find safety

<br /><br />Once in many tiny grains
<br />The sand blows in the wind
<br />My heart, in parts, was everywhere
<br />And that was to begin
<br />So some nice man took all the grains
<br />Added heat and made it new
<br />Handled it so carefully
<br />And he could see right through
<br />To him, it was a diamond
<br />It would shine in the right light
<br />Very gently, he would carry it
<br />To make sure it was alright
<br />If anyone got rough with it
<br />All care taken turns to waste
<br />And it shatters into fragments
<br />Leaving owners in disgrace
<br />You can't see through it anymore
<br />It glitters, or it bleeds
<br />You can't fix it back the same again
<br />If you try you won't succeed...

<br />Spite makes my stomach knot
<br />Rage forces my fists to shake
<br />Sorrow turns my eyes blood shot
<br />Insecurity pains my head
<br />Fear puts goose bumps up my spine
<br />Worry creases up my face
<br />I thought this body was mine?
<br />I struggle to control myself
<br />To feel how I want to feel
<br />But only outside substances
<br />Makes my dreams become real
<br />I drink to cease the guilt
<br />My head calms, face smoothes out
<br />Cigarettes relax my shakes
<br />Prevents my tears, fears are nau't
<br />Spite is not a problem now
<br />Cause all I feel is pain
<br />Won't someone keep me company?
<br />Or bring me in from the rain?
