They watch models and celebrities wearing expensive clothing and think they can never achieve that. However, achieving that look might be easier than you think. You can see how easy it is with the following fashion article.<br /><br />Add color to your hair if you want to have a vibrant look during the summer. Make sure that you try and keep up with it so it doesn't look faded. Be sure that you use a high-quality hair conditioner to protect your hair when you color it.<br /><br />Do not wear shoes with square heels if your legs are really short. These shoes look great on leggy women, but on you they will look ridiculous. Try a slimmer, higher heeled shoe.<br /><br />Don't wear outdated glasses. Some people spend hundreds of dollars on an awesome outfit, but wear coke-bottle glasses and spoil the whole thing. You can show your style off by choosing certain prescription eyeglass frames. Try on different styles to find one that makes you look great.<br /><br />Pay very, very close attention to the small details when you're attempting to be fashionable. A lot of people dress up and then forget something small, like a classy watch or the right belt, so that the entire ensemble falls flat. While traveling, make sure that your luggage and carry-ons complement your style.<br /><br />Consider subscribing to some type of fashion magazine or newsletter to stay current with the latest trends. This will help you stay on top of the constantly changing world of fashion.<br /><br />A fancy skirt should be pared with a simpler shirt. This shirt shouldn't contain bright colors because it could clash with your skirt.<br /><br />Black and white is a classic combination that is popular again this season. Models are sporting colorless looks at every fashion show. This trend is easy to adopt into your wardrobe, combining any number of pieces together in complementary black and white. There are nearly endless combinations you can wear with this combination.<br /><br />Change up the way you dress every now and then. You don't want to usher in a drastic change. Start by changing the jewelry that you are using, for example. Consider finding new ways to wear traditional pieces. You may find that a favorite scarf can look great as a loose belt.<br /><br />If you like to wear your shirts tucked into your pants, you should always wear a belt with this fashion style. If you do not like belts, you should at least sport a pair of fashionable suspenders. Remember to always match your belt or suspenders to your shoes.<br /><br />You can dress up jeans by pairing them with a shirt that is more dressy and a pair of heels, but this is only acceptable if you plan on wearing black jeans. Blue jeans usually look more casual, but they will work sometimes as well.<br /><br />Life may be difficult if you are unaware of how to improve your look. Thankfully, this article has prepared you for that. Apply what you've learned, and you'll look and feel great.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BkeHBlYWNlLm9yZy9ibG9nL2hlbmRyaWtwb2UxMTI3LzIwMTIvc2VwLzA2L2Zhc2hpb24tdGlwcy15b3VuZy1hbmQtb2xkLWFsaWtl" target="_blank">Solid Tips For Anyone Looking To Improve Their Fashion</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tvbWFob3Jpbmd5ZWJldGhhbnk0MjIyNC5wb2RvbWF0aWMuY29tL2VudHJ5LzIwMTItMDktMDZUMTRfMzVfMDUtMDdfMDA_" target="_blank">You Can Be Fashionable When You Know How</a>

You might end up living in fashion eras past, hopelessly behind the style times. Keep reading for some fashion tips that are relevant today.<br /><br />Matching your footwear to your outfit is a great way to look polished and put-together. It is a good idea for your belt and shoes to be the same color. This can create a classical look, which can go a long way in establishing professionalism.<br /><br />Brush the bottom edge of your cheekbone with bronzer to give your cheekbones a lift. Your cheek bones can appear to be much higher when you do this. This is a great way to look fashionable. This is just one simple tip for success.<br /><br />Keep a sewing kit around for minor repairs. A broken zipper or a ripped seam can be fixed easily and instantly if you have a sewing kit on you. Keep it with you and you can always be prepared.<br /><br />Don't forget the importance of accessories. No matter what type of outfit you're wearing, the right accessories can definitely add to it. Things like belts, scarves, bags, and jewelry are the deciding factor when it comes to a complete look. Keep the entire picture in mind as you get dressed, and accentuate your attire with the right items.<br /><br />Moisturizing shampoos can help with frizzy hair, so look for that property listed on the bottle. This will add a protective layer along your hair's cuticle, allowing it to remain soft and luxurious. Shy away from any products that are advertised as &quot;volumizing&quot;.<br /><br />Sift through the racks at nearby thrift stores. No matter what your style, you never know what you can find. While there will certainly be a fair amount of rejected, worn or damaged pieces, many a person has found a diamond in the rough when they take the time to look through their local thrift store. You never know what you're going to find, but it will no doubt be a bargain.<br /><br />Reading about trends helps to know about fashion. You can get a good feel for current trends by subscribing to fashion magazines or reading online resources. You should always select what you like in relation to your own style and taste.<br /><br />To keep white clothing fresh, add bleach to the washing water. Just use it cautiously or you could risk yellowing your favorite clothes.<br /><br />Come with a style that is unique to you. It is easy to dress like everyone else, but you should create a style all your own. You, of course, need a certain personality to be comfortable doing this, but once you take the leap, you will surely enjoy the many compliments for being unique.<br /><br />As stated earlier, fashion is about being yourself. Research different fashion topics to find what is best for you. Keep these tips in mind as you try to improve your fashion.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BkeHBlYWNlLm9yZy9ibG9nL2hlbmRyaWtwb2UxMTI3LzIwMTIvc2VwLzA2L2Zhc2hpb24tdGlwcy15b3VuZy1hbmQtb2xkLWFsaWtl" target="_blank">You Can Be Fashionable When You Know How</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tvbWFob3Jpbmd5ZWJldGhhbnk0MjIyNC5wb2RvbWF0aWMuY29tL2VudHJ5LzIwMTItMDktMDZUMTRfMzVfMDUtMDdfMDA_" target="_blank">How To Learn More About Style And Fashion</a>

They watch models and celebrities wearing expensive clothing and think they can never achieve that. However, achieving that look might be easier than you think. You can see how easy it is with the following fashion article.<br /><br />Some online research can help you see what is &quot;in&quot; each season. When you do your fair share of research, you are going to ensure that you are dressed correctly for any occasion that arises for you when the time of season comes.<br /><br />Carry a small sewing kit in your purse for small repairs. If a button pops off or your clothes tear, you can instantly repair it and avoid embarrassment. Make sure the kit includes the essentials like a needle and neutral-colored thread.<br /><br />The way you style your hair speaks wonders about you and your personality. So it is very important that your hairstyles reflect your personality and where you are in your life. You want a hairstyle that fits the image that you are trying to portray, such as a career woman's sophisticated bob cut. If you're a busy mom, a style that looks great with minimal effort will be your best bet.<br /><br />Don't pump your mascara wand. It doesn't get more of the mascara on the brush, it actually pushes air into the bottle. If there is air inside your mascara, it will dry quickly and some bacteria might appear. To load more product onto your mascara brush, you need to move the brush around inside of the container.<br /><br />Consider subscribing to some type of fashion magazine or newsletter to stay current with the latest trends. This will help you stay on top of the constantly changing world of fashion.<br /><br />Always have a few belts around for utility and fashion reasons. These belts will help to secure your pants in place so that they do not move. This works for all ages and sexes.<br /><br />There may be fashion &quot;do's and don'ts&quot;, but do not hesitate about trying something new. You won't know how it looks until you try. Mix and match a variety of colors, fabrics and styles, even when the &quot;rules&quot; suggest not to. You will look marvelous and create a look you love by giving yourself more options.<br /><br />Buy a lot of basics. Try to get pieces that work together and have a sense of fashion longevity. A very basic black skirt has the ability to be worn forever, paired with a multitude of tops and in style for years to come.<br /><br />Make sure that your style is your own and geared to your liking. There really isn't one perfect outfit or style for everyone. Each of us chooses the trends we like to follow. If someone tells you what you should or should not wear, politely tell them the decision is yours alone.<br /><br />You can dress up jeans by pairing them with a shirt that is more dressy and a pair of heels, but this is only acceptable if you plan on wearing black jeans. Blue jeans usually look more casual, but they will work sometimes as well.<br /><br />After you read this article, you should have a lot of ideas to get yourself looking fashionable again. Do not let things get in the way of looking and feeling beautiful.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTI4NDA4X3lvdV9jYW5fYmVfZmFzaGlvbmFibGVfd2hlbl95b3Vfa25vd19ob3c_" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjcmYW1wO2Jsb2dlbnRyeV9pZD01NTU3NDc5" target="_blank">Solid Tips For Anyone Looking To Improve Their Fashion</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy80NTcwOTMtU29saWQtVGlwcy1Gb3ItQW55b25lLUxvb2tpbmctVG8tSW1wcm92ZS1UaGVpci1GYXNoaW9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Solid Tips For Anyone Looking To Improve Their Fashion</a>

Well today you will get some great advice on how to look better.<br /><br />To some people, fashion is just about clothing, but in reality, there is more to it. However, there are many other influences you have to worry out besides your clothes. The wrong hairstyle or the wrong accessory could easily mess up your look. This is why it is crucial that you figure out how to properly manage your hair.<br /><br />Many fashion magazines are available in online and paper subscriptions. They provide photos of what is trendy at the moment, and you will also be able to use the ideas to develop your own style.<br /><br />If you are overweight and want to look skinnier, wear a blouse in black or a very dark color over a dark-colored skirt. Dark colors slim you down by causing the eyes to go to your jewelry and accessories. The skirts you wear should have elastic waistbands to make you feel comfortable.<br /><br />Don't forget the importance of accessories. No matter what type of outfit you're wearing, the right accessories can definitely add to it. Things like belts, scarves, bags, and jewelry are the deciding factor when it comes to a complete look. Keep the entire picture in mind as you get dressed, and accentuate your attire with the right items.<br /><br />Be mindful and aware of your physique's good traits and not so desirable attributes. Fitted clothing can help to accentuate a smaller person's best features. If you are busty, look for items that draw the eye away from that area with eye-catching skirts or pants. Women with pear-shaped figures should wear light clothing on top and darker clothing on bottom.<br /><br />When you are buying a new piece of clothing, find out what it's made of. All materials will be listed on the garment tag. Something that fits in the store may not fit after a couple wash cycles if it is a low quality fabric. Don't bother wasting your money on clothing that's just going to shrink up, become easily frayed or otherwise lose its original shape.<br /><br />Compensate for extra weight by wearing solid colors. Dark colors will make you appear smaller. If you are small, wear bright clothes to seem larger to other people.<br /><br />Changing your hair color each season can make a great change to your look. However, your hair needs to be healthy so that the color doesn't fade too fast. Select hair products that are color-safe.<br /><br />Come with a style that is unique to you. It is easy to dress like everyone else, but you should create a style all your own. You, of course, need a certain personality to be comfortable doing this, but once you take the leap, you will surely enjoy the many compliments for being unique.<br /><br />Now that you've come to the end of this article, you can see that being in fashion is not out of your reach. It could even be fun! Follow these tips and you will see fashion in a different light.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjcmYW1wO2Jsb2dlbnRyeV9pZD01NTU3NDc5" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy80NTcwOTMtU29saWQtVGlwcy1Gb3ItQW55b25lLUxvb2tpbmctVG8tSW1wcm92ZS1UaGVpci1GYXNoaW9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">How To Learn More About Style And Fashion</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTI4NDA4X3lvdV9jYW5fYmVfZmFzaGlvbmFibGVfd2hlbl95b3Vfa25vd19ob3c_" target="_blank">Solid Tips For Anyone Looking To Improve Their Fashion</a>

The hardest part here is actually figuring out where to start from to look your best. There are many things you need to consider, and a lot of information you need to know. Here are some fashion tips you can use to get up to speed with your fashion sense.<br /><br />Mousse is a great way to volumize thin hair, but be moderate. Really huge, high hair that was popular during the 80s might be in style, but it's difficult to pull off and often leads to an unflattering look.<br /><br />Allow plenty of closet space for your clothes. When you're packing clothing items in like sardines, you can cause them to stretch, tear, and even to discolor. You need at least an inch of room between each garment.<br /><br />A strong foundation is what fashion is all about. A correctly fitting bra gives you definition and a nice silhouette. You want any underwear that you chose to wear to give support and the appearance of a sleek figure. There are many great slimming undergarments available that can help to hide problems and make you look great.<br /><br />An early fashion tip for you: quilted fabrics are making a comeback and will be in style this fall. You can find all types of clothing made from this fabric. Quilted fabrics are meant to be worn loosely, but if you aren't careful, they can leave you looking bigger than you are.<br /><br />There are so many options in fashionable hair accessories. Hair accessories are things like hair bows, headbands and ponytail holders, but they also include hair extensions. Your wardrobe should have several of these. For example, if you want to look athletic, wear an athletic suit and a matching ponytail holder. If you are dressing for a night out with friends, opt for a sparkling hair bow or headband to compliment your outfit.<br /><br />Fashion magazines can help you stay current regarding today's trends. Magazines are a great resource for information and give you a handy place to target the fashion ideas you are interested in.<br /><br />Try to keep up with the fashion trends on your budget by trading or selling clothes that you no longer want. You can even sell old items online these days, so consider that as a place to get rid of your old clothes. You may either receive money back from your items or get store credit.<br /><br />Wear your hair up in a casual bun to keep it off the shoulders. When you're having a busy work day or school day, long hair is a pain. Put your hair in a bun if you face the stresses and traumas of work so that you do not have to worry about it.<br /><br />If you like to wear your shirts tucked into your pants, you should always wear a belt with this fashion style. If you do not like belts, you should at least sport a pair of fashionable suspenders. Remember to always match your belt or suspenders to your shoes.<br /><br />Don't overlook thrift stores. Whether you're into bargain clothing or vintage pieces, thrift stores shouldn't be avoided when looking for something fashionable. There is buried treasure to be had at these stores. It is like a fun treasure hunt for clothing!<br /><br />Regardless of what you wear, there is always a way to look more fashionable. It is not all about how things look on you, how you feel in them means just as much. Doing what lets you be comfortable with yourself is always in style.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9oZW5kcmlrcG9lMTEyNy9wb3N0cy8yMzI1MzE1L1lvdStDYW4rQmUrRmFzaGlvbmFibGUrV2hlbitZb3UrS25vdytIb3c_" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb29kcmVhZHMuY29tL2V2ZW50L3Nob3cvNjgwODMyLWZhc2hpb24tdGlwcy1mb3IteW91bmctYW5kLW9sZC1hbGlrZQ__" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>

This is just one simple tip for success.<br /><br />Mousse is a great way to improve the volume and look of your hair. Thinner hair can definitely be thickened well with products like mousse, but there is a distinct possibility that you will go too far. Using too much of a product like this in thin hair is going to create a plastic-like unnatural look that you want to avoid.<br /><br />Don't forget the importance of accessories. No matter what type of outfit you're wearing, the right accessories can definitely add to it. Things like belts, scarves, bags, and jewelry are the deciding factor when it comes to a complete look. Keep the entire picture in mind as you get dressed, and accentuate your attire with the right items.<br /><br />For frequent travelers, wrinkle resistant clothing should take up the majority of your wardrobe. Although most hotels include irons, you can save more time by skipping the iron if you don't need it. Keep your dresses, slacks, and shirts hung up when you are in a hotel.<br /><br />Dress in a way that complements your personality. Try to gear your look towards your style, not the popular style at the moment. Instead, allow your personal tastes to work with the trend so you look and feel comfortable. Your style can be classic or grunge, but it is your own personal style.<br /><br />Compensate for extra weight by wearing solid colors. Dark colors will make you appear smaller. If you are small, wear bright clothes to seem larger to other people.<br /><br />To keep white clothing fresh, add bleach to the washing water. Just use it cautiously or you could risk yellowing your favorite clothes.<br /><br />Come with a style that is unique to you. It is easy to dress like everyone else, but you should create a style all your own. You, of course, need a certain personality to be comfortable doing this, but once you take the leap, you will surely enjoy the many compliments for being unique.<br /><br />You need to be savvy when thinking about fashion. You need to use your knowledge to help others understand your fashion sense. People will see your keen fashion eye when you use knowledge.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlbmRyaWtwb2UxMTI3LmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvRmFzaGlvbi1UaXBzLUZvci1Zb3VuZy1BbmQtT2xkLUFsaWtl" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/hendrikpoe/blog/blogid=11928885" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>

There's nothing wrong with that! There are a lot of things you can do to improve your sense of fashion. This article contains many fashion tips to keep you looking your best. Read on for more!<br /><br />Try incorporating a lot of solids into your wardrobe. Wearing a solid skirt or pair of pants offers you the opportunity to wear a fun shirt on top. Darker colors on the bottom will lead the eyes upward and help you establish eye contact and hold it.<br /><br />Do not wear shoes with square heels if your legs are really short. These shoes look great on leggy women, but on you they will look ridiculous. Try a slimmer, higher heeled shoe.<br /><br />Wear dresses that match your figure. What body feature do you like best? Don't focus on your cleavage if your best feature is your legs. For example, you can wear short skirts and high heels; that's fashion success. Be proud and show off your best assets.<br /><br />Don't pump your mascara wand. It doesn't get more of the mascara on the brush, it actually pushes air into the bottle. If there is air inside your mascara, it will dry quickly and some bacteria might appear. To load more product onto your mascara brush, you need to move the brush around inside of the container.<br /><br />Consider subscribing to some type of fashion magazine or newsletter to stay current with the latest trends. This will help you stay on top of the constantly changing world of fashion.<br /><br />Fashion magazines can help you stay current regarding today's trends. Magazines are a great resource for information and give you a handy place to target the fashion ideas you are interested in.<br /><br />Black and white is a classic combination that is popular again this season. Models are sporting colorless looks at every fashion show. This trend is easy to adopt into your wardrobe, combining any number of pieces together in complementary black and white. There are nearly endless combinations you can wear with this combination.<br /><br />Change up the way you dress every now and then. You don't want to usher in a drastic change. Start by changing the jewelry that you are using, for example. Consider finding new ways to wear traditional pieces. You may find that a favorite scarf can look great as a loose belt.<br /><br />Reduce the clutter in your closet for extra storage room. While you might think that having a lot of clothes gives you a ton of options, this really is not the case. The more items you have to look at, the more frustrated you'll become. It is time to toss or give away anything that you have not worn in the last year, as well as items that no longer fit well. A couple of classic, go-with-anything items are much more useful to you than very old styles.<br /><br />Don't overlook thrift stores. Whether you're into bargain clothing or vintage pieces, thrift stores shouldn't be avoided when looking for something fashionable. There is buried treasure to be had at these stores. It is like a fun treasure hunt for clothing!<br /><br />After you read this article, you should have a lot of ideas to get yourself looking fashionable again. Do not let things get in the way of looking and feeling beautiful.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlbmRyaWtwb2UxMTI3LnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4NjIzMTAveW91LWNhbi1iZS1mYXNoaW9uYWJsZS13aGVuLXlvdS1rbm93LWhvdy8_" target="_blank">Fashion Tips For Young And Old Alike</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzQzMTY5MCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjIxMTUyJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjcmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzYyMTE1MiZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjc_" target="_blank">How To Learn More About Style And Fashion</a>

Well today you will get some great advice on how to look better.<br /><br />Matching your footwear to your outfit is a great way to look polished and put-together. It is a good idea for your belt and shoes to be the same color. This can create a classical look, which can go a long way in establishing professionalism.<br /><br />If you are concerned about the expense related to upgrading your wardrobe, sell off your old clothing. Try selling your items in an online auction style site or bring them to a consignment shop in your town. Most consignment shops give you the option of receiving cash or using store credit to pick items you like from their inventory.<br /><br />If you are overweight and want to look skinnier, wear a blouse in black or a very dark color over a dark-colored skirt. Dark colors slim you down by causing the eyes to go to your jewelry and accessories. The skirts you wear should have elastic waistbands to make you feel comfortable.<br /><br />You can use your credit to buy a few new pieces. Just as the items are affordable to you, you can get yourself a nice wardrobe and give yourself an updated fashionable look.<br /><br />Be mindful and aware of your physique's good traits and not so desirable attributes. Fitted clothing can help to accentuate a smaller person's best features. If you are busty, look for items that draw the eye away from that area with eye-catching skirts or pants. Women with pear-shaped figures should wear light clothing on top and darker clothing on bottom.<br /><br />When you are buying a new piece of clothing, find out what it's made of. All materials will be listed on the garment tag. Something that fits in the store may not fit after a couple wash cycles if it is a low quality fabric. Don't bother wasting your money on clothing that's just going to shrink up, become easily frayed or otherwise lose its original shape.<br /><br />Spend time with a fashion consultant and find out the colors that flatter you. It all depends on what kind of skin tone you have as well as eyes and hair which determine how the colors appear to people. When you learn which colors are best for you, you will most likely want to use those colors because they make you look more alert, happy and beautiful.<br /><br />To keep white clothing fresh, add bleach to the washing water. Just use it cautiously or you could risk yellowing your favorite clothes.<br /><br />Do not pump your mascara brush up and down inside the tube before applying it. This will only trap air in your mascara container. A hard pumping action can even promote the growth of bacteria inside of the bottle. To help coat the brush with mascara, slide it around a bit inside the container.<br /><br />After reading this article, your fashion knowledge is much greater. Always pay attention to new styles that may arise. If you remember the tips from this article, you will be able to keep up with the fashion trends and stay fashionable.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hlbmRyaWtwb2UxMTI3LnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4NjIzMTAveW91LWNhbi1iZS1mYXNoaW9uYWJsZS13aGVuLXlvdS1rbm93LWhvdy8_" target="_blank">Solid Tips For Anyone Looking To Improve Their Fashion</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzQzMTY5MCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjIxMTUyJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjcmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzYyMTE1MiZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9aGVuZHJpa3BvZTExMjc_" target="_blank">How To Learn More About Style And Fashion</a>
