One may wonder as to why this saying is applied and the simple reason is because it is only in Malaysia that one finds almost all the ethnicities that make up Asia.
<br />The country is divided into two different land forms by the South China Sea i.e. a peninsular and an island. The peninsular part of Malaysia is highly urbanized with colossal buildings, bright lights, discos, theatres and the ever changing technology. The island part of Malaysia however is still filled with lush green tropical forests, wild life and is still ages away from the modern technology. Book Malaysia Travel Packages and discover the two different worlds of technology and nature that lay side by side in perfect harmony.
<br />As the country is divided into two different landforms the number of places to see and things to do are numerous. The two parts of the country are in complete contrast to each other and provides a traveler with very unique sights which will awe him/her.

George Town is also an important part of Penang which displays the effects of Dutch colonial rule.
