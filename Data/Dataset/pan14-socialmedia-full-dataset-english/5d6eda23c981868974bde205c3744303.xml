<br /><br />i recieved one email from her through the MLG- microsoft learning gateway..
<br />tat reads
<br /><br />'Dearest Crescentians,&lt;--&quot; crescent girls' students&quot;
<br /><br />MLG may be a platform for us to voice out our opinions but please, do not take advantage of this by sending mass emails (asking around for lost stuff is still tolerable) or use it to sent miscs emails to frame/hurt your friends. (we dont need to know which teacher you love/hate or who's engaged and what not)
<br />I believe that the previous email sent by NUR DIYANINGSIH BTE AMRUN was not sent by her but someone who hacked into her account.
<br />To prevent further hacking cases such as the above, I greatly urge all of you to CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS and save your bitching/ranting/gossiping away from MLG as most of us would agree isnt very becoming of a Crescentian.
<br />You might find me such annoying or a busybody but please do not get me wrong, I am not pinpointing anyone,seriously(:
<br />After all, “Friends are like bras: close to your heart and will always there for support.” so please cherish your friends during your 4 fours in Crescent and life would be alot more meaningful(:
<br /><br />Sorry to bore you with such a longwinded email.
<br /><br />Yours sincerely,
<br />A Crescentian.&quot;
<br /><br />that is rather cute of her.. i like the phrase &quot; FRIENDS ARE LIKE BRAS: CLOSE TO YOUR HEART AND WILL ALWAYS THERE FOR SUPPORT.' that is rather true. hahaha <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> lol

<br /><br />this is wat i think abt it. ITS RATHER IMPOSSIBLE!! we have tons and tons of Co2 in our atmosphere. we need it for survival.  the global warming will take place, ice age will come again. these cannot be stopped but can be pushed back as long as we know how to prevent and reduce... reuse as well as recycle the rubbish tat we created. 
<br /><br />we should be clear that the weather is changing drastically. maybe u cannot feel it. but i believe most of u here had watched the movie THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW right?! that will happen... one day. maybe not in our time but think about ur futhur genernations. ppl think. pls be more self aware and keep our earth in gd condition. we cannot always relay on our government, we need to relay on ourselves. Maybe one fine day, the machine that can absorb Co2 will be created .. but when will tat happen? tomorrow or next week?? animals are getting endangered nowadays. why? because we poach them?? no. not really but because of the damage we did to our envirnoment and thus causing both the man and animals to suffer.
<br /><br />i m not here to tell ya to stop driving.. smoking (smoking maybe.. will be gd for ur health<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />) or causing fire or so but to asking/convincing ya to be more aware of our surrounding ... our mother nature... our society. that r lot more things other than urself. so ppl look out for the interesting things that is taking place around u!!
<br /><br />ps: happy  Valentine... after this longwinded post.. or essay maybe... haaa <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />but the onli thing that is great about lvl 6 is that its coolin~~ haaaa. i heard lots of complains from my friends on the ground floor! haaaa haaa . suits themselves right. hohoho.. joking. i m not that mean.. (blink~~blink)
<br /><br />having maths and physic on monday and chem... Amaths and chinese paper2 on tuesday then... freedom... yipeee.. then holiday.. then test...test....test...exams...exams....exams.. 
<br />but as comparing to those who are working.. school is fun.. exam is nothing.. cause u had wat i had b4.. and we dont have office politics but class parties.. lots of sweets** chocolates**candy**lollipops**twisties**crackers**all the yummy stuffs that are banded from bring up to the class. hahaha <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> dont tell my teachers.. but actually. my form teacher is really open and crack jokes with us... she is the maid of the class.. haaa. cause she sweeps the floor for us... hee. she is so nice. we love her. she had nv scolded us b4 but we are extremely scared of her sometimes bcause we do respect her when it comes to serious things. 
<br /><br />i love all my teachers.. all young at heart... except one.. who dont really teach me.. MRS .DT. i m really lucky . why?? cause i didnt had her for my maths.. (sweat) she is those kind or teacher who will say..&quot; ladies---- [cause i m in a girl school and our school motto is ladies and leaders of tomorrow]--- i dont want to leacture u all because all of u are so sweet (we blink...blink...blink..) and graceful. but u all have to noe that i m here to help u study so please give me ur attention. (smile)&quot; then she goes &quot; so lets turn to pg XXX of ur ten years series and do qns blar..blar...blar...&quot; then after she finished this sentence.... &quot;hmmm. shall we do it together...???&quot; &lt;-- that i suppose is a qns.. but she continued &quot; ok take out ur pen and foolscap paper. draw ur margin with a 30 cm long ruler. write down ur name.....blarblarblar&quot; 
<br /><br />k after i had typed such a long essay abt this teacher.. u can imagine how tried and how my friends felt during her lessons .. 
<br /><br />i m trying to emphasize here is that ... TEACHERS!!! WE R 16 ALREADY.. I DONT SEE THE NEED OF TELLING US TO DRAW MARGIN USING 30CM LONG RULER!!! and blar..blar... blar... further more she always eats into our recess and lunch time. where we onli have 35 mins to Q,buy,eat,return the plates.... climb all the way up to the 6 lvl from one end of the school to the other end....
<br /><br />k i noe i m really very random.. haaa just hear me complain abt my.... teacher.. (luckily she dont teach me.. hohohho<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />) too bad from those under her...
