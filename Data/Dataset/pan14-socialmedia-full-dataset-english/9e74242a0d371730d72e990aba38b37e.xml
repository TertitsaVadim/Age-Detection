<br />He told his friends that it was cool,
<br />And when he pulled the trigger back,
<br />It shot with a great crack.
<br />Mommy, I was a good girl, I did What I was told,
<br />I went to school, I got straight A's, I even got the gold!
<br />But Mommy, when I went to school that day,
<br />I never said good-bye,
<br />I'm sorry Mommy, I had to go, But Mommy, please don't cry.
<br />When Johnny shot the gun, He hit me and another,
<br />And all because Johnny, Got the gun from his older brother.
<br />Mommy, please tell Daddy; That I love him very much,
<br />And please tell Zack; my boyfriend; That it wasn't just a crush.
<br />And tell my little sister; That she is the only one now,
<br />And tell my dear sweet grandmother; I'll be waiting for her now,
<br />And tell my wonderful friends; That they always were the best;
<br />Mommy, I'm not the first, I'm no better than the rest.
<br />Mommy, tell my teachers; I won't show up for class,
<br />And never to forget this, And please don't let this pass.
<br />Mommy, why'd it have to be me? No one deserves this,
<br />Mommy, warn the others, Mommy I left without a kiss.
<br />And Mommy tell the doctors; I know they really did try,
<br />I think I even saw a doctor, Trying not to cry.
<br />Mommy, I'm slowly dying, With a bullet in my chest,
<br />But Mommy please remember, I'm in heaven with the rest;
<br />Mommy I ran as fast as I could,
<br />When I heard that crack, Mommy, listen to me if you would,
<br />I wanted to go to college, I wanted to try things that were new,
<br />I guess I'm not going with Daddy, On that trip to the new zoo.
<br />I wanted to get married, I wanted to have a kid,
<br />I wanted to be an actress, Mommy, I wanted to live.
<br />But Mommy I must go now, The time is getting late,
<br />Mommy, tell my Zack, I'm sorry but I had to cancel the date.
<br />I love you Mommy, I always have, I know; you know it's true,
<br />And Mommy all I say is, &quot;Mommy, I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />In Memory of The Columbine &amp; Virginia Tech Students Who Were Lost
<br /><br />Please if you would, Don't smash this on the ground. If you pass this on, Maybe people will cry, Just keep this in your heart, For the people who didn't get to say &quot;Good-bye&quot;.
<br /><br />--Now you have 2 choices:
<br />1) Pass this on, and show people you care, repost as &quot;Try Not To Cry&quot;
<br />2) Don't send it, and you have just proven

<br /><br />BOY LEAVES, GIRL IS TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT, AND DIES.
<br /><br />but wht the boy didn't kno is that the girl only asked him those questions so she could hear him say it one last time, and she only broke up w/him because she knew she only had 3 more weeks to live, and thought it would cause him less pain and give him time to get over her before she died.
<br /><br />NEXT DAY
<br /><br />the boy is found dead with a gun in his hand..with a note in the other...
<br />THE NOTE SAID:i told her i would take a bullet for her....just like she said she would die for me...

<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE... 
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR... 
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR... 
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did... 
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT... 
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY... 
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER... 
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... 
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED... 
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...

<br />some friends one
<br />evening
<br />and time passed quickly as each shared
<br />their
<br />various experiences of the past year.
<br /><br />She ended up staying longer than
<br />planned,
<br />and
<br />had to walk home alone. She wasn't
<br />afraid
<br />because it was a small town and she lived
<br />only
<br />a
<br />few blocks away.
<br /><br />As she walked along under the tall elm
<br />trees,
<br />Diane asked God to keep her safe from
<br />harm
<br />and
<br />danger.
<br /><br />When she reached the alley, which was a
<br />short
<br />cut to her house, she decided to take it.
<br /><br />However, halfway down the alley she
<br />noticed
<br />a
<br />man standing at the end as though he
<br />were
<br />waiting
<br />for her.
<br /><br />She became uneasy and began to pray,
<br />asking
<br />for
<br />God's protection.
<br /><br />Instantly a comforting feeling of quietness
<br />and
<br />security wrapped round her, she felt as
<br />though
<br />someone was walking with her.
<br /><br />When she reached the end of the alley,
<br />she
<br />walked right past the man and arrived
<br />home
<br />safely.
<br /><br />The following day, she read in the
<br />newspaper
<br />that
<br />a young girl had been raped in the same
<br />alley
<br />just
<br />twenty minutes after she had been there.
<br /><br />Feeling overwhelmed by this tragedy and
<br />the
<br />fact
<br />that it could have been her, she began to
<br />weep.
<br /><br />Thanking the Lord for her safety and to
<br />help
<br />this
<br />young woman, she decided to go to the
<br />police
<br />station.
<br /><br />She felt she could recognize the man, so
<br />she
<br />told
<br />them her story.
<br /><br />The police asked her if she would be
<br />willing to
<br />look
<br />at a lineup to see if she could identify
<br />him.
<br /><br />She agreed and immediately pointed out
<br />the
<br />man
<br />she had seen in the alley the night
<br />before.
<br /><br />When the man was told he had been
<br />identified,
<br />he
<br />immediately broke down and confessed.
<br /><br />The officer thanked Diane for her bravery
<br />and
<br />asked if there was anything they could do
<br />for
<br />her.
<br /><br />She asked if they would ask the man one
<br />question.
<br /><br />Diane was curious as to why he had not
<br />attacked
<br />her.
<br /><br />When the policeman asked him, he
<br />answered, &quot;Because she wasn't alone.
<br />She
<br />had
<br />two tall men walking on either side of
<br />her.&quot;
<br /><br />Amazingly, whether you believe or not,
<br />you're
<br />never alone. Did you know that 98% of
<br />teenagers
<br />will not stand up for God?
<br /><br />Repost this as Love vs. Sex if you truly
<br />believe
<br />in
<br />God..,
<br /><br />PS: God is always there in your heart and loves you no matter what.....and if you stand up 4 him he will stand up for you.
<br /><br />I bet 93% of you people dat read this wont repost
