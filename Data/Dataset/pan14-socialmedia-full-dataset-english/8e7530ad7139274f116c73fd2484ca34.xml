<br />Menu??see the pictures?
<br /><br />We went Jack’s Place in Wangfu Street with our mentors (Raymond, Cindy, Leo, Sue, and…) and my classmates on 29th, Nov. We had the delicious Italian food as lunch.
<br /> I ordered a Beef Tender Loin Steak Set includes some pieces of Garlic Bread, a plate of Garden Salad, a bowl of Fresh Mushroom Cream Soup(or borsch), Beef tenderloin Steak (220g) and a bottle of soft drink. 
<br />I chose this Italian restaurant just because I am curious with authentic Italian food. I had “Italian Pasta” in Chinese restaurant before but I didn’t believe it was the same as real Italian Pasta. So when I got this special chance to go to a real Western restaurant with our mentors and my classmates, I chose Italian restaurant immediately.
<br />About food: The beef steak tasted great because of the special jam. However, the cook cut it into thick pieces so when I try to cut them, the beef was still red inside. The soft drink and salad were normal. But the borsch was a little bit different. I found that there wasn’t any potato in it. In the past, I always found potatoes in this kind of soup. I like the soup best because it was different from normal borsch, it tasted sourer and I had a special feeling with it.
<br />Those Italian foods were really different from food that I usually have, especially their taste and style. I liked them because I used to have Chinese food. Italian food don’t have much oil except the beef, I thought they were really good for health.
<br />The environment is good. They clean the restaurant carefully and there wasn’t any dust in the corner. But I was not so satisfied with the atmosphere.
<br />The restaurant was too loud and it wasn’t the style of a western restaurant. 
<br />      There were also some teenagers and young adults there. The waitress and waiters were polite. I may recommend this restaurant to my friends because I think it was really cool.

<br />     I worked in a small library called Nantong Teenagers’ Library during the winter holiday. Their books are almost for teenagers and children. Such as famous books, cartoons, comics, novels and so on. I did some volunteer job there:
<br />   ? They have new books every week. When I was there, they had new books by chance. So I had to put a stamp with”Nantong Teenagers’ Library” on the first page of each book. And I also had to stick a long, narrow magnetic stripe on each book so that those small children would not take away the books without my notice. Here is a photo
<br /><br />(I am putting stamps on each book.?)
<br />  ? I also helped some borrower borrow and return the books.
<br />There was a machine called scanner. I had to put those books on it and when I hear a sound like “be~”, I know the machine had registered the book. Here are two pictures.
<br /><br />(I am helping a mother returning the book.?)
<br /><br />(Her book exceeded the time limit so she had to pay some money for the library.)
<br />  ? The teacher asked me to help her do some cleaning job. I used a wet cloth to clean the corner of the bookshelf. And when the borrower returned their books, I had to put them in correct place. And when there were few people, I have to arrange the books. At first, I was not familiar with the book arranging. However, I could put the books in correct place much quicker after two days. That was an excited achievement.
<br />   To finish these work quickly and correctly, I had to be patient enough and careful enough. I should not listen to my MP3 or do something else when I do this work, unless I would make a lot of mistakes. I should also pay enough attention to what I was doing. Maybe I thought it was bored to put stamps on books, but if I statistics different types of books, that must be interesting.
<br />Actually, I did it. When I felt bored, I transfer my attention to those special pictures in different books. And I got a lot of fun.
<br />My responsibility was important. I had to keep the safety of those books. There were some people called me from time to time. They wanted renew their books because they had not finished yet. I had to tell them the time of limit and register for them.
<br />I practiced to communicate with strangers and solve their problems as well. It was difficult for me at first because I was not able to communicate with each other well before. That was an excellent experience for me and I got a lot of achievements, such as to be patient to young kids, to look for something carefully and so on.
<br />The teacher there was kind enough to me and helped me a lot. I couldn’t find the correct way to manage a small library without her help.
<br />I thought I was a really good volunteer during the winter holiday and I not only helped other people but also myself.

The restaurant is called Les 5 Cents. The setting of the restaurant was quite nice. It was just like a real restaurant in France. The house was fit up in red and white. It gave me a peaceful and magnificent feeling. We chose the restaurant because we would like to try French food and it was the nearest French restaurant next to our school. I heard that French food is not similar to other country’s food because of its cooking materials and the methods that the cooks use, just like Japanese food.
<br />   We went into the amazing restaurant and sat down. We ordered many different foods with obvious French style. Both I and Sharon tried the French handwork noodles and two ice cream balls. We four had a French pizza and roast goose leg as well. Here are two pictures.
<br />    (Sharon and I) 
<br /><br />(Julie and I)
<br />     I like the taste because I LOVE cheese! However, Sharon was not used to it because she liked Chinese food better. The taste maybe didn’t fit her. The chef was real French. He added a lot of cheese and milk into the noodles and put an egg which was almost raw on the top of the noodle. Those kinds of food are really different from daily food that we eat. There are more cheese, tomato jam, lettuce, and other materials that we seldom use in daily life. The taste was even much more different between each food there. The environment was nice and the waitress wrote English on the menu. It was really quiet there and I felt a noble atmosphere. When we went there, there were a few foreigners and several young ladies seemed like white collar. The waitresses were polite and hardworking, they served us very well.
<br />   I’d like to recommend this French restaurant because I hope more people will try this kind of French food and taste a different feeling from western country.

We went to the Master Yun Brocade Art Gallery for the yun brocade exhibition on the second floor. When we walked into the door, we were all surprised by huge amounts of colors on the walls and inside the glass showcases. It was the first time that we saw such different types of yun brocades. And they gave us a quite positive impression.
<br />   Yun brocade is the most gorgeous and noble silk weaving. It is the crown of Chinese silk industry. It has a very long history. (From Ming dynasty) People from that dynasty use this material and technique to make clothes, little umbrellas, purses, fans, pencil cases, boots, and ornaments and so on. It has already been a kind of fashion at that time. Women used them for demonstrating themselves. Rowena, Julie and I went into the exhibition and we got another surprise. We found that we can determine our own favorite artwork. It confirmed that although those artworks were from the same artist, it still has different styles and they were all excellent. There were all different kinds of clothes hanging on the wall. If we get closer, we can see many gentle lines on them. We touched them and they were very smooth because they are silk. 
<br />  We three walked deeper inside the room and we found a lot more rectangle artwork. There are chrysanthemums, dragons, phoenixes, kylins and other types of Chinese traditional symbols. They had different colors and textures. Because Master Jin used different main colors for each artwork, they represented different moods. For example, my favorite artwork was been used red silk thread for background and dark brown for dragon. On the yun brocade, there is a dragon which is around the fire and clouds. There are a lot of clouds and they are colorful. The boarder of the dragon is a white line. I felt an enthusiastic and positive feeling. Because of the red wind and fire, the dragon seems energetic. It looks like the dragon can fly out of the 2D square at any time. Some blue clouds balance the whole yun brocade. The dragon looks not relaxed but brave and bellicose. Julie’s favorite artwork is made by brown and golden silk threads. It gave me a calm and luxurious. The dragon on that yun brocade looks much more violent than the dragon on mine. It was not only because Master Jin used different colors but also because of the motion and expression of the dragons. That was the best amazing part of such artwork.
<br />  Besides those yun brocades hanging on the door, there were also some little goods inside the glass showcases. There were tiny umbrellas, boots, purses, and other demonstrators. These artworks were very special and unique. It can’t be imitated easily. Sometimes I feel dizzy because there were too many colors from the yun brocade. And I was totally excited when I enjoyed them.
<br />  In my opinion, the brocades are wonderful and they were a part of Chinese history or culture. The Chinese government should protect them and spread this traditional culture.

We interviewed an art professional there. The young girl worked there and her job was to sew some beautiful yun brocade. We interviewed her and got some information about her job and her opinions.
<br />  We knew that she didn’t need any diploma to get that job. The entire important thing she should do was to study the sewing skills and deal with the huge loom. She first got touch with this job because she was interested in art project especially traditional artwork. She loves color and images. Her work was to sew all different types of yun brocade everyday. It was really difficult for us to understand how she combines each thread into a wonderful image. However it seemed that she liked to think about it and focus on it very much. 
<br />  She has to face a lot of difficulties from the beginning. “When we learn this skill in the beginning, we found it quite tough to arrange all different colors of threads.” She said with a smile on her face. “I will show you an example.” Then she sat in front of the huge wooden machine. At that time, we noticed that there was another girl sitting on the top of the machine and she helped the first girl arrange those pieces of clothes. There were thousands of different colors of threads in the air. I felt dizzy about the process. However, they said they were used to it and they cooperated and made a piece of yun brocade in a few minutes. I observed it and I found it was a dragon’s tail. It was amazing! I couldn’t believe the cloth was made by the two girls. They said it was also difficult but after a lot practicing, it has got much easier. 
<br />   The girl told us that her favorite artist was Master Jin Wen. He is their teacher and friend. She said: “I like Master Jin Wen not only because he is our teacher and taught us a lot, but only because I really admire his artwork. They are REALLY amazing and imaginative. We can not reach that high level even if we are 100 years old!” When we heard about this, she took us to other artworks that Master Jin Wen created. She pointed out all the details and specific art designs to us. I felt quite proud of Chinese traditional art after she showed that creative yun brocade to me. 
<br />   My favorite yun brocade in that exhibition was called Gold Peacock and Dragon. It is round outside. The main color is red and dark brown. On the yun brocade, there is a dragon which is around the fire and cloud. There are a lot of clouds and they are colorful. The boarder of the dragon is a white line. I felt an enthusiastic and positive feeling. Because of the red wind and fire, the dragon seems energetic. It looks like the dragon can fly out of the 2D square at any time. Some blue clouds balance the whole yun brocade. The dragon looks not relaxed but brave and bellicose.
<br />   In a word, I enjoyed this tour very much and knew a lot more about traditional Chinese culture.

I worked in the haunted house for Art Club. Art Club decorated the whole GCA house into a big haunted house. We sold tickets to GCA students before Halloween and prepared for a long time. They made many cards and handed them out to each classroom. The visitors’ task is to collect those cards in order to get the final price. I dressed up as a ghost in a film called “Scary Movie”.
<br />During that time, I had to stay in an empty classroom with a boy next door. We moved all the desks and chairs around the classroom and we hung a person’s head on the fan in the middle of the classroom (of cause it was made of plastics). I felt a bit frightened when all the lights were turned off because “ghosts” couldn’t talk to each other until the visitors left. I sat near the window alone and I started to look at the head floating below the ceiling. It swayed here and there. I had to put the three cards inside. That was a huge challenge for me because I was afraid of that soft head. I tried my best to reach the head but I was not tall enough. The boy helped me finally. (I felt a great luck at that time.?)I stayed in the classroom almost the whole process.
<br /> I gained an important insight¬¬¬¬——braveness. I was very cowardly at first. But my duty is to scare those visitors. I had to frighten the students but not myself. I breathed several times and started working. I sat next to the window, and it was very dark in the whole house except a small candle in front of each classroom. I can hear my heart beating quickly. A few minutes later, there are four girls came in. when they approached the window in front of me. I pulled the curtain up quickly and stretched my arms to them. They screamed and jumped immediately and rushed to the door. They came in the classroom but keep a distance between us. The boy stood up then. They screamed again and after a few minutes one of those girls asked:“where are the cards?”. The boy pointed to the head. Those visitors put a desk under the fan and got it finally.
<br />When we do this job, we must be creative and know how to scare people in a smart way. I was beat by some Grade 11 students. Those boys may want show their strong and brave in front of their girlfriends. I realized that I should be far away from those students after I was beat 4~5 times..
<br />We ghosts shouldn’t leave the haunted house until the visitors left. That was our responsibility. We stayed there without any delicious food or drinks. I made many friends and if we collaborate, we will do a better job.
<br />   That was an interesting experience.
<br />I joined Shopping Club last term. The leader is Chelsea. She helps we members do some shopping online and remind us of taking notes of how we use our money every day. I learned to keep accounts every day so that I can use my money more reasonable. Here are two pictures of my account book.
<br />After taking part in Shopping Club, I learned how to buy goods online and to compare the same goods in different online shops. I knew that I should compare not only the façade but also the quality. I should look at those pictures under the basic information carefully and write cash book everyday.

Sometimes I go running in the evening after supper. My mom likes to go with me. We run around near our home or we go to some park. In my hometown, there are a lot of people in the park in the evening. Most of them are old women and men. They want to do some exercises to become healthier like us. They go jogging, running, walking, dancing and other activities to improve. So I join in them sometimes. My mom competes with me so I get more energy to run fast.
<br />On 5th, April, I went to Anhui province. It is my mother’s hometown. My mother’s brother whom I called him uncle lives in the countryside. He has his own garden and he plants some vegetables. I helped him plough the fields. It was a really tough job. I could hardly wave the digger. It was very heavy for me and I was not used to do such farmer’s job. So it was a great chance for me to improve my strength and make my muscles harder. 
<br />I also help my mother do some housework when I go back home. I clean up living rooms, wash dishes, clean up kitchen, and wash clothes and so on. I helped my mum reduce her pressure and she was very grateful to me. But I think it is my duty to help my parents do these simple works and make them relaxed.
<br />My friends and I went out for skating. We took our own skateboard and went to the Sports Playground to get a larger place. At first I couldn’t skate because I was afraid to fall down. However, one of my friends could skate very well and she taught me how to keep balance on the skateboard. When I got her idea, all of us were happy because then we can skate together and faster to other places and we could even compete with each other.
<br />When I was in my hometown, I played badminton and volleyball with my cousin as well. If the weather was good, we would go out and play some ballgame. Sometimes we even ride bikes. If there is a big wind that day, we even fly a kite. That made us practices our motional skills and cooperation. 
<br />In some ways, physical activities make us feel tired but we can get a lot more that become healthier. We may get relaxed and comfortable after we take a running or some activity else. In my opinion, it’s a good idea to have this part on portfolio because it can supervise students to take more exercises.

My roommates Rowena and Julie went there with me and we knew a lot more about Buddhism in Jiming Temple. The sun was shiny and it was a wonderful day. We chose Jiming Temple for religious service because we wanted to know more about Buddhism. Buddhism is the most famous religion in China. Many people believe that the Sakyamuni controls all lives. Because of this, we saw a lot of people in Jiming Temple. They burned joss sticks and worshiped every fair with a pious attitude.
<br />   Actually, I was not very satisfied with the tour because the smell and smog float everywhere. I think it was not good for the environment. The smell and smog was a kind of pollution in some ways. I found it interesting when Julie taught me some etiquette to formally call on the Buddha. The honesty of the believers touched me and I was interested that Chinese people can have such purity belief. If people have a gracious belief in their heart, they can look forward and keep a positive attitude to life. However, I think it must have other ways for the believers to connect their idols. Except such polluted way, they should use better options.
<br />   We had a special experience that day; we took photos, burn joss sticks, bowed, and did other types of ceremony. In a word, the tour was not that amazing but it was a kind of interesting which added our knowledge.

We went there to watch the 2009 M-zone Famous Singers’ Concert. It was amazing! A lot of popular singers came there such as Dalv Su, Will Pan, SHE and other famous people. We were extremely excited. People shouted, jumped next to us and people were almost young man or teens. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. We choose this performance just because of this. There are many singers we like in the group.
<br />  I like it very much not only because I like pop music but also because the singers are my favorite. The singer who gave me the deepest impression was Will Pan. He is a ABC, which means America Born Chinese. When he came to the stage, all the people stood up and shouted, made noise. Too many girls were too excited that they even couldn’t control their moods. I was very excited as well and I sang when he sang. He did a quite excellent job because he put all his motion, feelings into his songs. All of us could feel his mood so we were touched.
<br />  The performance was successful not only because it has pop singers but also the arrangement and the order of the concert. The host and hostess made some games during the break time. It was really funny and interesting. 
<br />  In a word, the concert was extremely successful and I enjoyed it very much.

<br />     We were very nervous before it went to our term. We practiced and practiced when we sit under the stage. We were afraid if we forget the song lyric. It was our term. We walked to the stage slowly but with confidence. At first, my partner was too nervous and she clenched the microphone. Because we had too many people, the microphones are not enough for us so we might share. However, she held the microphone tightly and I couldn’t even make a sound! It was really funny that I stood on the stage and tried to rob the microphone from her hand. I felt quite embarrassed at that time because I should face so many people but I did such stupid behavior. After a few minutes, she seemed relaxed more. She held the microphone softly and soon I could hear my voice from the speaker. 
<br />     I observed other group members silently and noticed their behaviors. The performance was really successful because we cooperated well. I learned that our behavior affect other members. If we get more relaxed but not nervous, the result will be much better. And we should put effort into our performance so that if we get on the stage, we won’t forget those lyrics and we can be more confident.

We saw many other scenes besides flowers as well. The environment in Xuanwu Park made me very comfortable. We took a lot of photos in front of different beautiful scene. At the centre of the flower exhibition, there are many sculptures made by flowers. I have a deep impression with one of them. It was like a huge bowknot. In front of the green bowknot, there are four different shapes of people. Although they look simple, I can still determine their action. It was very interesting that people can made by flowers. In front of the four people, there was a hemisphere also made by shrubs. The background of the hemisphere was green but there were four yellow Chinese characters in them. It said: Walk into Jiangsu Province. It welcomed tourists from everywhere in the world. There were some red flowers demonstrated the whole artwork and it was enjoyable.
<br />   We chose this place because we wanted to get closer to the nature but not other open air markets. I think the flower exhibition was interesting and I really like it. We saw many sculptures in our daily life and they are made of many materials such as wood, metals, and other common materials. In the flower exhibition, every sculpture was made of flowers or shrubs. It was quite interesting to see that people cut those plants into different shapes.
<br />   That was an interesting experience because we seldom see this style of art.

It was inside the Mausoleum of the Ming Emperor and those activities took place around the peak of the mountain. We chose this event since we seldom see plum blossom, especially plenty of them blowing at the same time and I was quite curious of it.
<br />In the morning, we climbed up the plum flower mountain and it took us about 1 hour and a half to get to the center of all kinds of activities. We went through a path full of different snacks such as tofu, bums, cotton candies, toothpicks meat and so on. I took pictures and enjoyed some food there.
<br />After a half-hour trip, we arrived at the peak of the mountain. The first thing that attacked me was colors of the plum blossom. I’ve only seen red plum blossom before but that day I saw pink, white and red flowers all around the mountain. The amount of those flowers was huge and all different colors spread out and covered most area of the half-mountain. That was quite amazing since I’ve never seen this scene before. Jack and Nick also appreciated it and enjoyed the food very much. There were many people playing around, taking their children, joining all categories of activities, and they made the whole atmosphere really busy.
<br />It was very exciting. We climbed up to the mountain but we didn’t feel tired. It was a sunny day and I really enjoyed the sun. Also, the beautiful, amazing and alive environment made me cheerful.

<br />Last summer I did a lot of sports. I had to take IELTS class in July so I had to ride my new bike in order to get to New Channel which is located in the Nanjing Museum. It took about 20 minutes for me to get there and if I was stopped by the traffic light, it may take longer. I had to spend much energy because I put the gears to the hardest. It seemed that I was training muscles because I felt so tired after riding my bike. Actually riding bike it’s a quite good activity because it can improve the movement of heart and lungs, and it can train a person’s endurance. It also presents my brain from getting older quickly. I lose a little bit weight as well after July.
<br />I also went to see my taekwondo coach and played taekwondo for some times. I felt so excited when I was playing it that I even didn’t notice the time from time to time. Although I felt so tired after playing it every time that I was not able to stand up when I arrived home because my two legs felt so sour, I am still loving it because it was interesting and useful. If I meet some bad people who want to rob me, even if I can’t beat him, I can escape easily.
<br />After the new term began, I had P.E classed every Tuesday with all of my classmates. Each class took about 2 hours and most of us really enjoyed. There were 5 different types of P.E classed during the year and some of them attracted us while some didn’t.
<br />The first class we took was basketball. The teacher told us the way that he marked——to run from each side of the wings and shoot. If we get four points, we earn full marks. That was quite interesting though it took us lots of time to practice. However, only a few of us complained since that was easy for most girls and the teacher gave us enough time to finish the task. Our second class was gymnastics inside the gym. That was quite hard because few of us had that much flexibility to finish all the actions. To our surprise, boys did better than us girls. Then we had volleyball classes. We had to hit the ball over our heads more than 100 times and couldn’t let it fall off. Later, the teacher tried to train us by correcting our gestures and movements. After playing volleyball, we had Ping-Pong classes. Most students had learned ping-pong before and this could be the easiest class for them to finish. However, it was quite difficult for me since I’ve never played Ping-Pong. But I handled it soon since the teacher taught me patiently.
<br />Through these classes, I’ve learned a lot and had a lot of fun. They told me that when I face difficulties, I should never give up. There will always be someone ready for me. And also, I will overcome those obstacles with my own efforts and confidence.

It’s located on Tai Ping South Road and we attended to learn the paean and listened to the pastor about eulogizing the god and praying for our guilt.
<br />At about 9 am, we arrived at the gate of the church and I felt a different atmosphere immediately. I chose this religion to get information since I went to Ji Ming Temple last year and it was from ancient Asia but Christian was from Europe. Compare with Ji Ming Temple; the St. Paul’s Church gave me a calmer atmosphere since there were plenty of trees surrounded the whole church instead of josses, sticks and candles in Ji Ming Temple. It was much cleaner in the church and I heard some people were singing from the inside lobby of the church. 
<br />As we came into the hall, we were guided by a volunteer and she gave us a book of hymn, which were full of songs that praise the Jesus. We sat down on the bench and listened to the pianist playing anthems and the pastor lead us to sing. After that, all of us stood up and read the anthem together. However, we quit earlier before it ended.
<br />I enjoyed this very much since I had a totally different feeling when I entered the church. The cross, the candles, the sculptures of all kinds of angles and other elements inside the church made me feel holy and pure. It’s quite interesting since I found a different way to present people’s belief compare as traditional Chinese religion. I knew more about western culture through this service and I gain lots of knowledge from it.

We went to the show in the morning at about 9 o’clock after we finished visiting another museum. It is located near the Youth Center in my hometown——Nantong. The exhibition was set there for a long time but I didn’t notice it before. I chose this exhibition because I thought that this is a quite different kind of show since people seldom take out kites as an exhibition. And for me, kites are not interesting stuff. I’d like to see what a kite exhibition would be like. On that day, when I entered the show I was shocked. Here is my experience.
<br />I got into the exhibition while I was talking to Chris. And suddenly I shushed. What I’ve seen would be one of the most amazing things in my life. There were so many kites hanging on the wall that I couldn’t decide which kite I was going to see first. Most of them were quite big. My favorite one, for instance, was much higher than twice of my height. And also, there were hundreds of bells in different sizes. Some of them were in the size of our fists and some were larger than our heads. I was quite confused since I think that these bells would drag the kite from the sky and the weight would forbid flying. However, the curator told us that this kind of kite could reach the place much higher than normal kites and we were all very surprised. The artwork that Chris and Miles liked also grabbed my attention. Miles was attracted by a blue kite which was in the size of the addition of four or five magazines. There were two big bells hanging on the relatively smaller blue kite. The shape of the kite was like a snowflake and it was really beautiful.
<br />I enjoyed the kite exhibition since I’ve never had similar experience before. It was my first time to see so many colorful kites hanging on the wall as an exhibition. In the past, I seldom notice this category of shows in my hometown. However, after that experience, I felt proud of my hometown since there are not such amazing shows take place in the surrounding cities, at least all the places I’ve been to before. It showed me the wisdom of Nantong local people and their creativities in the art area.
<br />I took a very different view of my hometown later and discovered several impressive exhibitions after I took part in this exhibition. All of my achievements of finding the deeper interests of Nantong culture are coming from what this exhibition had brought to me. I would like to recommend it to all of my friends and I’m sure they enjoy it as well.

My friend is called Julie and her hometown is Danyang which is very close to Nanjing. The concert took place in Danyang Gymnasium. It was a quite large gym which could contain about 20,000 audiences. We chose this concert since I really like one of the singers appeared in the concert called Leehon Wang. He is one of the most popular stars in China, even in the world. Julie and I entered the gym at about 7:30 pm and we waited for the concert started. The concert was extremely successful. Those fans jumped everywhere and shouted and they kept the atmosphere always at a hot point. I really enjoyed because it was the first time to see Leehon. He was much more handsome than those photos on magazines and posters. When he appeared on the stage, I stood up on the seat as quick as I could and shouted his name. It was crazy for me since I seldom feel that exciting and surprising. I just sat in front of my idol less than 10 meters! I was really cheerful and this experience would affect me since I was astonished by what I have seen in that concert. In the past time, I only went to one or two concert and I was not this close to singers on the stage. It was the first time I felt that I can reach the person who only appears on the TV and the Internet so easily.

On the International Labors’ Day, I went to this museum in the morning with two of my friends, Chris and Miles. Shen Shou was born in Jiangsu Province and she was a famous professor of embroidery in Qing dynasty. She did some embroidery and gave them to the Empress Dowager CiXi to praise her long-live life. Hundred of years later, people find those amazing artwork and thousands of people followed her way to do the sewing to form extremely beautiful paintings. For instance, my favorite one, five galloping horses running on the cloth and I was attracted by them almost immediately when I entered the exhibition. 
<br />That artwork might took months to complete since it looked like a picture made by paintings but actually if you get closer and observe neatly you will find out that it was formed by needlework. The mouth, the horsehair, the hooves, the eyes and even the actions of five horses, were all made by every single thread across each other. It was extremely neat and I thought that the artist would be have tremendous patience since normally people will not have such patience to finish this kind of tasks. 
<br />There were all categories of contents of embroidery such as beautiful women with different gestures, bamboo shoots, red crown cranes, different containers from western countries, koala, tigers, goldfish, turtles and even Chinese traditional calligraphy. I was shocked. We thanked the guide and we wanted to see that embroidery there were two floors inside the museum and it hanged about more than 50 artworks. I watched each of them really carefully. However, I couldn’t find even a tiny mistake. Every single thread was in right position and they were arranged so neatly and so great. 
<br />Embroidery is normal and popular in recent years. Girls like to make them as gifts. However, there will never be such amazing embroidery made by normal girls. This kind of artwork was created by smart native people and even the latest technology can’t make the pattern so pretty.
<br />I got much experience from this exhibition. The creativity and the hard working of Chinese local people touched me and I really enjoyed the atmosphere that it created there. It made me feel the religion since there were some characters of Buddhism. And also, it combined culture from both western and eastern of the world by the descendents.

<br />      Firstly, I played in the school girls’ basketball team. We had a training every Tuesday from 6 pm to 7:15 pm. Under the leading of Ms. Mulluly, we had strict training and most of us worked really hard. In the beginning, I had no idea of what I should do in the basketball court and I didn’t understand the rule of basketball. Later, Ms. Mulluly taught us with great patience. Even we always made mistakes; she was still patient to correct us. From the most basic things we needed to know to the techniques we had to learn while playing a game. She led us to move on step by step and never have a stop. We went to Tongxiang for a game which was in Zhejiang Province. Those girls in Zhejiang were quite strong. A few of them had complicated skills and we had a hard time to enter our roles at first but later we got the feeling. Girls in our team co-operated quite well and we beat them in 24:14 for the first round. Then we had a break. We encouraged each other during the break and Ms. Mulluly commended us. She always said, “Perfect shoots!” “Excellent!” “Nice try!” to the girl who got a point or was about to get a point. She encouraged us and we just kept making progresses and kept shooting. After the second round, we had 14 points but they didn’t make any score. We were very satisfied to see the result. The two teams shook hands and ended the game. In my opinion, we got this great result because of our hard-working before the game.
<br />     Also, I am a member of Stella’s D.I.Y Club. The slogan of D.I.Y Club was “do it your self and have fun”. We painted on masks on a sunny afternoon after school. Stella bought some white masks and some paints for us. We used our creativity and produced quite different masks finally. It was hard to use the paints on the flat masks but we handled it later.
<br />     I had lots of fun and most of my friends enjoyed those club activities. I am also a club leader for Photo Diary Club. We only held activity once but I decided to give a party for all Gemini at the end of May this year. I hope all my club members would enjoy.

On the 2nd in April I became a member of the singing competition successfully. The event was called GCA Idol and all the GCA students watched the show. After we entered the first roll we got the chance of rehearsal. In our group, there were three students, iris, jack and I. Jack played the guitar so well that most audiences were attracted and he really helped us a lot. We have prepared two songs, BABY from Justin Bieber and JUST NIGHT from an unknown singer. We spent most of our after school time practicing. Although I was quite tired of repeating the same song before the finals, I still felt a sense of accomplishments. When we were on the stage, I was quite nervous that time since I have to face all grade 10, 11, 12 students. I was afraid of embarrassing. However, after Jack started to flip the string, I was in what role I had to play. I sang and tried my best. Though we didn’t get the top five, we were still proud of ourselves since we’ve made a lot of efforts and we were satisfied with ourselves. We had fun staying with partners. This experience gave me a lot to think about. We had arguments during practicing but finally we calmed down. The most important thing was to co-operate with our friends since no one can be successful if there is no partner to help you.

It is inside Aqua City near the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. It was a German restaurant which provides food from a quite separated country from China. We chose this restaurant since we’ve never experience German food. We went there for supper and we didn’t have much food since it was quite expensive and we suffered from the weird tastes. I had a set of meal with chicken wings. It also included fried chicken, cucumbers, a piece of peach, a piece of pear, and purple sweet potato. When the food was taken to the desk first, I was astonished. How could they pick up such food that didn’t match together? In China, we seldom use this way to arrange food. The cucumber, for instance, Chinese women would never put them with potatoes, especially in a same plate. I didn’t like the food but I really loved the atmosphere. Setting of furniture in there was interesting and they provided special flip with beautiful smoke surround. Most customers there were foreigners and it seemed that they enjoyed a lot. The service was also nice. The waitresses were polite and to my surprise, most of them could speak German. Actually I don’t recommend my friends have food there since in my opinion, the tastes didn’t fit Chinese flavor. But it’s a good choice to sit there, have something to drink and chat with friends. The fitment there was quite attractive.
