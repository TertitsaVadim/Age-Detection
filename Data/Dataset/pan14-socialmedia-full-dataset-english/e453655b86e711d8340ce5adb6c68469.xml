This is the reason why a handy gadget like cell phone has been invented to sustain this need. There are two essential communication systems utilized for these cell phones. Here, we have the CDMA system which is a system of coded response that significantly ties the phone as well as its user together into that particular system and number. And because of the significance of this system, it is widely used in the US and even in other countries. Meanwhile, the second system also known as the GSM which means Global system for Mobile Communication is systems which become a popular in the United States and few other countries all over the globe. 
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx1bmxvY2suY29t" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/83252567_12397565_23961085.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />GSM system utilizes a SIM card in order to allow communicating with the particular network.  Here, the network providers are capable of locking the cell phone to prevent it from responding to a SIM card that comes from the alternate provider. This is usually made for competitive purposes however, for some people such practice is not fair to many. When the time comes that the cell phone is being purchased and has been exclusively owned by an individual, the owner will have the ability of changing the SIM card and can use the cell phone in any network which the owner prefer to use. This makes the cell phone usable when traveling particularly in foreign countries without paying any excessive roaming charges. 
<br /><br />But the question is how to unlock the cell phone? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx1bmxvY2suY29t" target="_blank"><strong>Unlocking cell phone</strong></a>  includes different steps. First thing you should do when unlocking the cell phone is to determine what type it is. If it uses a CDMA system, then it doesn’t apply the use of SIM card and you don’t need to find ways how to unlock the cell phone. Second step, once you have determined what type of cell phone it is and you have to sure that it is a GSM phone and make sure it’s really locked. One of the best things that you should do is to use a SIM card that has an unlike service provider and test if the said SIM card will work on your phone. Once you insert the SIM card, that phone will detect that it is now your SIM. So, if is not locked, you will surely receive an error message.  
<br /><br />Next thing to do is to search the web and look for a trusted company that gives the code for it to be unlocked. The service provider will ask for a small fee to send you the code. Basically, the code needs to be typed in to your cell phone to have it <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx1bmxvY2suY29t" target="_blank"><strong>unlock</strong></a> . Usually, you could get a rather cheering message from the cell phone itself. However, in any situation, you could test it by utilizing another SIM like what you did the past determination procedure. 
<br /><br />Keep in mind that an unlocked phone is the fundamental privilege of the owner. The GSM phone locking to make it hard for you to select your provider is not a fair practice. Luckily, this is a simple injustice that could be corrected easily.

Fortunately, there are people who can <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx1bmxvY2suY29t" target="_blank"><strong>unlock mobile phone</strong></a>  for a small fee.
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/83252567_16487270_26555439.jpg" />
<br /><br />If you want to have the mobile phone that you have always dreamed of without paying the obscene costs, the only way to go is by signing a contract with a network - or so you thought.
<br /><br />Very few people know that mobile phones are designed without a need for an unlock code. They are supposed to work with any network you choose. Unfortunately, the best phones today are released by network providers whose main goal is to find ways to keep their subscribers. 
<br /><br />They offer the latest and most coveted phones for free or at a lower cost if you sign up for a contract with them. This is an effective marketing strategy since the phones can't be used with another network and you have no choice but to deal with them. This fact means that networks aren't really offering the cell phones for free, they're just delaying payment.
<br /><br />This is basically one of the reasons why you should get an <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx1bmxvY2suY29t" target="_blank"><strong>unlock code</strong></a>  for your phone. This way, you have the freedom to switch network providers as soon as your contract expires or you won’t even need to enter a contract if you can get an unlocked cell phone.
<br /><br />If you get an unlock mobile phone then consider yourself as lucky. But if you're thinking of switching providers but you want to keep the phone, don't despair, there's a way out for you too.
<br /><br />How to unlock a phone? The process may be simple, but it has to be done by a professional if you don't want to risk damaging your phone.
<br /><br />Technology has advanced so much that mobile phone unlocks can now be done remotely through the internet and at a cheaper price too. There are experts out there who offer their expertise on unlocking cell phones for a very minimal fee.
<br /><br />The problem with switching phones is not only a matter of cost; it is also about the need to relearn the features of the new phones. A Motorola or a Blackberry may have more features than a Nokia, but they are also more difficult to use. If you change phones, you will also need to think about how you can transfer your phone book, but if you had an unlocked phone your phone book can easily be transfer by just putting in your SIM card in the unlocked mobile. This, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg. Other than this there are numerous other problems that you may encounter when you change phones.
<br /><br />You can choose to give in to the “nothing personal, just business” strategies of your network provider. You can choose to buy a new phone each time you become unsatisfied with a network providers services. You can also choose to find another way to solve your problem and seek the services of people who know how to unlock a phone and pay a considerably cheaper amount than what you would spend in buying a new phone. 
<br /><br />Remember, money does not grow on trees so spend it wisely. Also, a new phone might be too technical, too complex and too annoying to learn so you better stick to the one that you are now very familiar and happy with.

<br /><br />It is simple to see why many people want to unlock their respective mobile phones. Having a mobile phone locked actually brings inconveniences and additional costs for many mobile phone consumers. 
<br /><br />This is especially true when these consumers want to be more flexible in choosing their respective mobile phone network provider. A locked phone actually means that your phone was programmed in a way that it would only recognize SIM cards provided by your original network provider. 
<br /><br />Remember the fact that network providers are the ones who lock mobile phones. In this case you are not able to use your phone when you will not use a SIM card provided by that specific network provider. It may mean a lot of dollars when you want to switch to another network provider. 
<br /><br />For instance, whenever you want to change your network provider, maybe because of cheaper rates or because of personal tastes and preferences, then you can only do so by buying another mobile phone. However, choosing to unlock your mobile phone would enable you to avoid buying another mobile phone when switching networks.
