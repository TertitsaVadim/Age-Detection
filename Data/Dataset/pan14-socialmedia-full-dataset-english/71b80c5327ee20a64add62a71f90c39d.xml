With clever marketing tactics, it's possible to draw customers in and improve your business. The use of advertising is crucial to the success of any business. From Internet marketing to print ads, there are many popular options that can fit into your marketing budget. One clever way to get the attention of potential customers is through the use of funny stickers. With careful and even clever placement, stickers can be real attention-getters, driving up sales for your company.<br /><br />Once you've decided to include funny stickers in your marketing strategy, it's time to consider the ways in which you'll use them. With a little imagination, stickers can be placed in unexpected places, which will really get your business noticed by consumers. Instead of thinking as stickers as only belonging on the bumpers of cars, think of other places they might be placed. The fact is stickers can be placed just about anywhere. Plus, they can be custom designed to fit the concept of your business. From shopping centers to city streets, stickers can be placed anywhere you might find potential customers.<br /><br />Escalators in busy malls or office buildings are clever places to put your funny stickers. There are stickers that are specially designed to adhere to the escalator surface, making them safe. These floor stickers will get notice all the way up or down the escalator, making them a useful marketing tool. Benches at bus stops or in any public place might also be a great place for funny floor stickers. As people sit on the bench, they will look down and see your company's advertisement. Placing funny stickers where the consumer will inevitably notice them is the best way to bring in new business.<br /> I found that this weblog demonstrated this well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fhometheaterpad.com%2F406%2Fstatic-sound-rear-surround-speakers%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hometheaterpad.com/406/static-sound-rear-surround-speakers/</a>  post.<br />Door stickers are another idea for using stickers for advertising. As customers enter a building or a store, they will notice the sticker. The funnier the sticker is, the more attention it's bound to get. These are ideal for glass doors, but could be used on any door. Making funny stickers glow in the dark is a great way to create stickers that are useful in both day and night. Movie theaters are great places for glow in the dark sticker advertisements, although advertising of this type is more likely to be found in other countries.<br /><br />Some larger cities have been known to incorporate manhole covers in advertising for large companies. Funny stickers placed on top of manhole covers on city streets and sidewalks can really attract attention. Advertisements for a coffee shop might be ideal for these steam-emitting features of most major urban settings. Other creative places you might use stickers include sidewalks, swimming pools, tennis courts, trash receptacles, or even public ashtrays. With some creative slogans and logos, stickers can be an ideal and quite inexpensive way to spread the word about your business. Funny stickers can even be placed on the packaging for other products, such as eggs.<br /><br />Keeping your business alive is about more than just day-to-day operations. In such a competitive and difficult economy, most businesses have to get creative with their marketing dollar to keep their business alive. From cost effective solutions like Internet marketing to traditional choices like newspaper ads, most businesses will use many different methods in their marketing strategy. Funny stickers are one of many other ways to attract customers to your growing business. With creative placement, funny stickers can be attention-getting, money saving advertising options. Once you've decided it's time to think outside the box when it comes to marketing, funny stickers are worth considering.

We struggle and fight to reach an age where we no longer have to be burdened by the enormous weight of financial obligation. It is a disheartening way to live. I found that this page explained this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Faskdatingexperts.com%2F2327%2Fgood-questions-ask-dating%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://askdatingexperts.com/2327/good-questions-ask-dating/</a>  website.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels the only way to break free from the cruel chains of fate is to take a chance. With one ticket, one golden lottery ticket, you can go from down on your luck to winning it all. You can finally live the life you intended, your choices no longer limited by the size of your bank account. Dine on the best food. Travel to the most exotic locations. Play. Live.<br /><br />But winning the lottery is pure luck, right? Wrong. Of course there is always some luck involved but there are things you can do to improve your odds dramatically. Here are 5 tips to get you started.<br /><br />1) Don't play 7 ball games if you want to win frequently. Play games with a lower number of balls. Play 5 ball games, then 6 ball games if you have no other choice. Your odds of winning increase with the lower ball games.<br /><br />2) Don't play the lottery games with the highest amount of numbers. The lower the amount of numbers in your game, the better your odds. If you have a choice between two games containing, for example, 35 numbers or 60 - go for the lower number!<br /><br />3) Do not play lottery games that use computer generated numbers. Make sure they are real balls - ping pong balls are most common - in a washer barrel machine.<br /><br />4) Don't rely on the lottery shop's quick pick numbers. Using your own numbers and a good lottery system will eliminate the least effective number combinations and improve your chances of winning.<br /><br />5) Play more tickets and focus your lottery strategy. Concentrate on one lottery game and buy as many tickets as you can. The more tickets you buy, the greater your odds of winning.

The countdown for the mega event has begun, and everyone, including the legends of cricket have started picking their favorites to win the World cup. According to the legends of the game India is favorite to win the World cup.<br /><br />In my opinion India is not favorite to win this World cup, even though they are top contenders for the coveted trophy. One of the main reasons for India's unlikely success is the fact they are playing in front of the home crowd. Such big events like World cup brings a lot of pressure on the players. The title of being favorites adds to already existing pressure of home crowd expectations. Indifferent form of their best one day batsman Yuvraj Singh could also harm India's chances. Moreover their senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar will be desperate for winning this World cup in order to have at least one big trophy under his belt before he retires from cricket. You can see Sachin Tendulkar faltering or failing when approaching an important milestone. He has never featured in a World cup winning team despite featuring in five editions of the tournament. This is likely to be the last World cup for Sachin Tendulkar. Sachin Tendulkar is known to fail whenever there is pressure on him. Any shrewd captain should be able to exploit this weakness of Sachin Tendulkar. Another issue would be the spot to play Gautam Gambhir. Gautam Gambhir is better as an opener. He might not be effective in one day games in the middle order, and it could disrupt the whole batting order. There is no clear picture yet as to what combination India is likely to go. There is too much confusion with too many confusing choices. But if some of the players in the Indian batting line up hit purple patch, nothing could stop India from winning this edition of the World cup.<br /><br />Australian team is not being picked as favorites this time. They are still the at the top of the ICC ranking table. Moreover reduced expectations on the Australian team might work in their favor. What could go against the Australian team is form and future of some of their key players, including their captain and star batsman Ricky Ponting. The Ashes results could also have a bearing on their performance in the upcoming World cup. The Australian team is still a force to reckon with and can peak at the right time to win the World cup.<br /><br />South Africa is my favorite to win the World cup this time. They neither have the pressure of being favorites, nor they are playing in front of their home crowd. The tag of being chokers might actually work in their favor this time. Because they have been labeled chokers, it may release the any expectations on them, and may ultimately release any pressure on them. They have one of the best batting line up and best the best fast bowler in the world in their line up. South Africa should be able to open their account for World cup trophies.<br /><br />The most unpredictable team ever, and the most unpredictable team in the tournament. Pakistan is not being given much of a chance by the pundits, but you should discount Pakistan at your own peril. Again, less expectation from this team may eventually work in their favor. Moreover, not having to play before home crowd, yet playing home like condition may also favor them. They may not have the best team in the world on the paper, but have the team to beat any team, and have players who can change the course of the game from any situation. I found that this webmaster explained this intelligently on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fblendereviews.com%2F361%2Flearn-3d-modeling-blender%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blendereviews.com/361/learn-3d-modeling-blender/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />England has also emerged as a very strong team in the recent past. They could repeat their success in T20 edition of the World cup in the one day version, of course with little bit of luck at crucial stages of the tournament. England also has considerably less pressure on them.<br /><br />Sri Lanka is a good team, but will be under pressure playing in front of their home crowds. I do not see Sri Lanka going all the way especially without Jaysurya in their ranks at the top of the order, and indifferent form of Tilakratne Dilshan. The Sangarkara's and Jayawardana's are not much effective in one-day format, especially in the absence of big hitters like Jaysurya at the top. They do not have a threating bowling line up either. I do not give much chance to Sri Lanka.<br /><br />New Zeeland is one team, about whom the less said the better. They have some capable cricketers, but are failing as a unit. A couple of good games at the knockout might just give them an outside chance of winning the trophy.<br /><br />West Indian team of today is exactly opposite of the West Indian team that participated in the first three editions of this prestigious tournament. I do not see West Indies winning this tournament, but cricket is funny old game.<br /><br />Bangladesh has the ability to upset quite a few teams in this tournament like it did to India in the previous editions. Ireland too can upset the big teams as it knocked out Pakistan in the initial stages of the tournament in the last edition of the World cup. The rest of the teams, I guess, are mere participants.

They are one of the oldest species living on the earth. Their body structure is so much well designed that they have even survived the extinction which the dinosaurs failed to survive. But now human beings have become the greatest threat for the survival of this mighty creature. We have destroyed the harmony of nature and environment in such a way that sea turtles who have survived great extinctions are now on the brink of getting extinct. We can learn about the present condition of the earth's climate and environment by observing the present condition of the sea turtles.<br /><br />Sea turtles are of great economic value. They are the assets of those countries who have them in their territory. Sea beaches are popular tourists spot. Every year lots of people travel throughout the beaches of the world. And the beauty of the sea beaches is its living beings. Without corals, fishes, turtles and other estuarine animals, sea beaches lose its beauty. And to keep the ecosystem of the sea working in a proper way, all living beings should be conserved.<br /><br />Green sea turtles are usually herbivorous in nature. They eat sea weds and keep them short which helps to maintain the quality of the sea bed. Sea grass also needed to be cut short like lawn grass for its better growth. Sea beds provide the ground for breeding for many valuable sea animals like crustaceans, fish, shellfishes etc. If turtles get extinct, health of the sea bed will be deteriorated and sea grass will decline. As a result, animals living on grass will be lost and this will affect other big animals who live on small herbivorous animals. Eventually whole ecosystem will collapse resulting in the destruction of the living beings of the sea which is the source of beauty of the sea beaches. So tourists would not come to travel sea beaches and the countries whose economies depend on tourism will suffer in the long run.<br /><br />Sea beaches and dune system can not hold nutrition. So vegetation does not grow well in dunes and in beaches it does not grow at all. Sea turtles nest and lay eggs on beaches. Each turtle lays almost 100 eggs each season. Not every egg would hatch and not each of the hatchlings would be able to come out of the eggs. All these unhatched eggs and hatchlings who do not become successful in coming out of the nest and make the way to the sea are the source of nutrition in the beaches and dunes. I found that this weblog demonstrated this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsofasreviews.com%2Fsew-puff-sleeves-answers%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://sofasreviews.com/sew-puff-sleeves-answers/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />The more the nutrition the more vegetation grows in dunes. And as more vegetation grows, ecosystem of the beaches and dunes works properly. The vegetation also grabs the sands firmly in the beaches and prevents from being eroded. This saves the beauty of the sea beach. As the number of sea turtles is decreasing day by day, nutrition sources of dunes and beaches are also decreasing as a consequence. This will lead to the failure of the whole ecosystem and as a result the beach will lose its appeal to the tourists which will affect the economy of these countries severely.<br /><br />Sea turtles have historical importance too. They were the symbol of aristocracy and delicacy in the ancient time. In China and Japan tortoise shell were used as a decorative ornament. They used to make it from carapace scutes of tortoise shell. Sea turtle scutes were processed by ancient Greeks and Romans to make components like brush and combs. Aristocrat class people used these tortoise produced components.<br /><br />Peru's ancient inhabits Moche used to worship the sea and living beings of the sea. Sea turtles have often been highlighted on their arts.<br /><br />Mexican people harvest sea turtles for food and boot. In many areas of the world coastal people depend on turtles for the source of protein. Their skin is used for making shoes and leather bags in many areas of the world. They also protect humans from the attack of deadly box jellyfish by eating them.<br /><br />We can see that the world is becoming a hostile place for sea turtles. It is a clear warning to us that it might become harder for us to survive too. If we learn from the mistakes which we have made and pledge to make things right to save sea turtles from getting extinct, we will be saving ourselves too.

But a color scheme can be interpreted in many different ways - imagine these two very different weddings using yellow, white and green...<br /><br /><strong>Citrus psychedelic</strong><br /><br />The bright lemon yellow and lime green of citrus fruits provide the color inspiration and theme for this wedding. Lemons and limes pop up all over the place, starting with the white invitations printed with a design of the cut fruit creating a free-wheeling pop art abstract graphic of circles and triangles. Arriving at the ceremony venue, guests are greeted by two miniature lemon trees heavy with fruit, that mark the beginning of the aisle. The service booklets are delicately scented with a lemon fragrance and white, yellow and bright green streamers gently wave at the sides of the seating area. The bride's party arrives and there is no mistaking the bridesmaids, as they appear in bright printed dresses of yellow and green teamed with lime shoes. To contrast against the busy pattern of their short dresses, their bouquets are white. The bride appears all in white, except for the bright yellow shoes that peek out from under her dress. Her bouquet is a riot of yellow, green and white. I found that this person demonstrated this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyZWFkbWlsbGV2b2x1dGlvbi5jb20vbG9zZS13ZWlnaHQtYnVpbGQtbXVzY2xlLWJvd2ZsZXgtcnVubmluZy1hbnN3ZXJzLw__" target="_blank">Mauro Neyaci</a> post.<br /><br />At the reception the citrus theme continues. Guests are refreshed with lime cocktails while waiting to be seated, and find that the wedding reception centrepieces include slices of lemon and lime floating in the vases. Name cards at each place are slipped inside a cut made in a lemon or lime, and favour bags alternate in lime green and bright yellow. A lemon garnish appears on the entree and a slice of sugared lime is popped into the dessert. Finally, full of good food and fine wine, the guests take to the dance floor, kicking aside the fluorescent green and gold balloons that fill the floor.<br /><br /><strong>Sugar and spice</strong><br /><br />The afternoon sun warms the cream walls of the country church, turning them a soft shade of butter yellow. Tall vases of traditional flowers - roses, gladioli, dahlias and carnations - stand at either side of the altar, which holds another arrangement in white and yellow. At the end of each pew a sweet posy hangs, attached with a white ribbon. The guests refer to their invitations - printed with a yellow lace border and tucked into envelopes lined in a fresh spring green - as the bridal party arrives.<br /><br />The bride is all in white - a simple gown with broderie anglaise detailing. The bridesmaid's dresses match but in soft yellow worn with pale yellow shoes. They carry posies of yellow and white roses with green accents.<br /><br />After the ceremony the guests are directed to a garden party. A couple of white tents with yellow bunting provide shade, and lemonade is handed out. A generous afternoon tea complete with cucumber sandwiches and miniature tarts is served, the guests sit at tables under umbrellas and dine off yellow plates with white polka-dots, teamed with yellow and white striped napkins. The wedding cake is a sumptuous tiered affair iced in white and decorated with yellow blossoms and green foliage. On leaving the guests are presented with individual cookies shaped like wedding cakes and ornately decorated with butter yellow and white frosting.

If you know only a little bit about consoles you probably heard of the Red Ring of Death error which affected as many as 30% of the first Xbox 360 models. Believe it or not Sony did not learn from Microsoft's mistake and the Yellow Light of Death is a PlayStation version of the Red Ring of Death. It also occurs due to the exact same reason as the Red Ring of Death.<br /><br />So what causes the RROD on Xbox 360 and YLOD on the PS3? The answer is overheating and poor design of cooling and chip attachment to the motherboard. These two flaws combined have catastrophic results and kill the console over time. Both consoles are extremely powerful but have too small casings with poor ventilation and release of excess of heat. After playing your PS3 for few hours what happens is the temperature rises a point where the solder joints attaching the CPU and GPU chips to the motherboard liquefy and then solidify again once you switch the console off.<br /><br />These heating cycles put stress on the solder joints and make them weaker and at a point, sooner or later one of the hundreds of solder joints breaks and the motherboard loses connection to the chip (either processor or graphical chip). At this point your PS3 will show the yellow light of death to notify you of the problem.<br /><br />Now that you know what causes the problem lets talk about your options to get your PS3 running again. I found that this person described this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NvZmFzcmV2aWV3cy5jb20vZnJlZS1jaGVhcC1mdXJuaXR1cmUtcXVlc3Rpb25zLw__" target="_blank">Shaquita Letchworth</a> post.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 1:&lt;/b&gt; If your console is still under warranty call the Sony customer service line (800-345-7669) and tell them what happened. You will have to send them your PS3 for repair or they will send you a refurbished one. It's completely free but you will have to pay the shipping and insurance and wait for few weeks to get your PS3 back.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 2:&lt;/b&gt; If your PlayStation 3 is no longer under warranty you can still send it to Sony for repair. But they will charge your $150 + shipping and insurance and you will only get a 3 months extended warranty on the repaired or refurbished PS3. So if something goes wrong with it and the yellow light of death comes back after this period you can prepare another $150 and forget about gaming for weeks again. I do not recommend this option because it's a waste of money.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Option 3:&lt;/b&gt; Don't feel like giving Sony $150 to fix a problem THEY CAUSED? You don't have to! You can fix your PS3 at home yourself. No need to waste hundreds of dollars (it cost you enough to buy the PS3) or having to wait for weeks. If you think fixing a PS3 requires a tech savvy person or special tools you are wrong. People who never took anything apart fixed their PS3's without any problems.<br /><br />All you have to do is follow a step-by-step video tutorial with commentary which will guide you through the whole process screw by screw and you could be playing your PS3 TODAY!

Her local doctor failed to diagnose the red flaky rash, and now she writes to me about this problem.<br /><br />First thing is I wish you courage and endurance, rashes can be a darned thing. I have had mine off and on for 20+ years. Currently, the one on my face is almost gone (a considerable improvement) and the scalp one is getting worse (perhaps a form of die-off). I have also tried washing my face with Neutrogena Tar Shampoo, and it does work, but I am worried about the consequences of long term exposure to coal tar, and use it only when the rash really flares up.<br /><br />A friend of mine had a rash on her leg for several months. She used gentian violet (an inexpensive but messy antifungal) and it went away. I found that this blogger showed this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RyZWFkbWlsbGV2b2x1dGlvbi5jb20vMjAxMDAzMDVmci1wcm9mb3JtLWVsbGlwdGljYWwtMzkwZS12aWRlby8_" target="_blank">Dorotha Tragesser</a> page.<br /><br />These are all signs of candida. Unfortunately, I do not know of any doctors who treat candida, much less in your area. I doubt that tanning will do anything for the rash and tepid showers may just make it worse if it is candida-related. Unfortunately, the only way to get rid of it is through diet and supplements.<br /><br />Some people are able to eat fruit on this diet. It's recommended that it is eaten alone, though. Supposedly, fruit is so acidic that it can help to kill candida. However, the sugar may feed the carbs you eat it with or something like that. Anyway, I've been told by several sources that as long as you eat fruit alone, it is OK. Others will disagree with me and I like this advice: stick to what works for your body.<br /><br />Even if you do the diet half way, it may be better than not at all, though.

Or is there something else?<br /><br />The debate is open and many have already said a lot on the matter, however most everyone tends to think, that if somebody is twice the size of the opponent he can only win, but in reality it is not always so. There is no doubt, that the advantage of the big is power, strength, weight, but what about the little? Is it just skill? And what if the big has the same skills?<br /><br />A first distinction, that needs to be made between the two is concerning speed: do you think, that the big and heavy moves at the same speed as the light and little? I believe that this writer explained this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGFpbGFuZG11YXljYW1wLmNvbS9hcm91bmQtdGhlLWd5bQ__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thailandmuaycamp.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thailandmuaycamp.com</a></a>  webpage.Of course not and this is one of the great advantages of the smaller ones. The old masters used to give, and some still do, following advise: &quot;if you have to face an opponent, that is bigger than you, remember to always keep moving and have him move too. In a static situation, both standing and on the ground, you are dead meat to be squeezed like under a press!&quot;<br /><br />In Japan the open weight division is nothing special or outstanding, it is rather natural and in the past there were really exceptionally small judokas who thanks to their outstanding judo techniques won all their matches against the heavy ones with ease.<br /><br />The same masters, that gave above advise also highly recommended to train in a specific way in order to face bigger or smaller opponents. It is not enough to try during judo training in the dojo several fights with various sized opponents, but it is also important to do specific drills designed for the light to face the heavy and for the heavy to face the light.<br /><br />When it comes to ground work again speed is important, but at the same time becoming a snake for the little can give some enormous advantages. You should always move along with your opponent and never oppose power or stiffen yourself, especially if he is twice the size you are. Chokes and arm locks are also highly recommended and again the golden rule is to always keep moving, never create static situations, which will of course favor the big and heavy.<br /><br />Athletes, that continuously keep training in order to improve their judo techniques however can even do something more, independently if they are small and light or big and heavy. They can both learn some more on how to improve their performance by mastering their nutrition besides their opponents.

A very strong statement but easy enough to prove from the walls of Sipadan, to the wrecks of the Philippines, to the outstanding muck diving of Indonesia, to the &quot;mola mola&quot; dives in Bali, Asia diving is always well represented in the 10 ten best dive lists every time.<br /><br />Budget travel in Asia is very doable compared to most regions in the world. Scuba diving is however usually a pretty upscale sport even in Asia. So what is the trick to get great Asian diving on a budget? One of the best ways is to find the edges of the season and communicate with the dive resorts and dive operators well in advance.<br /><br />For the biggest discounts you need to have a group traveling together of 4 to 8 divers willing to put up a large deposit. I personally believe that this blog owner demonstrated this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL2Fyb3VuZC10aGUtZ3lt" target="_blank">sinbi muay thai</a>  webpage.Another way to get bigger discounts is let the dive operator or dive resort book the has, accommodations and flights if possible for you, as well as any additional tours that you might want to do in the area, as packages offer the dive shop more opportunities to generate revenue, more revenue means they can sacrifice some margin and still make money.<br /><br />Bring your own dive gear, most shops offer discounts if you bring your own dive equipment, this will not be a big negotiation tip if you are traveling in off season as having enough gear will not be a problem, but if you are traveling in a very busy time like the Christmas Holidays if you have your own regulator, &quot;BCD&quot; and wetsuit you will be more likely to get a bigger discount if you negotiate.<br /><br />Become a repeat customer. Most dive companies love to have regulars as they are comfortable with you, and know exactly what your needs are. If you are friendly and easy to work with then they will be even more inclined to want to give you a break on their rack rates. It is a business truism that it is easier to keep a customer than to find a new one. Word of mouth is one of the best forms of advertising and if you are going to the same place many times you are going to tell your friends so the dive center and the divers all win.

But, there are so many shakes available today, how do you know which one is best? This article is going to talk about the best way to provide your body with healthy, natural nutrition.<br /><br />Many people turn to synthetic, man-made shakes when they want to lose weight. I believe that this site showed this simply on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGFpbGFuZG11YXljYW1wLmNvbS9jb250YWN0LXVz" target="_blank">muay thai thailand Thailand</a> blog post.They buy pre-made shakes or focus their shake ingredients around highly processes shake ingredients that can actually be harmful to their health. The problem with these fad weight loss shakes lies in the fact that they are made of highly processed and refined ingredients, and some of these shakes contain harmful chemicals and preservatives that are not good for your health!<br /><br />The best, natural way to give your body good nutrition is by making shakes with whole foods. Focus the ingredients on natural foods such as fruits and vegetables. Drinking a healthy shake with fruits and veggies will provide your body with the nutrients that are found in these healthy foods, but you will be able to quickly drink it down and your body will be able to digest the food easier.<br /><br />Fruit and vegetable shakes are best when they are prepared with raw foods. Choose fruits that are bright in colors because they contain antioxidants that are great for your health. Also, try adding in a few handfuls of a mild green vegetable, such as kale or spinach.<br /><br />I know that it sounds gross to add spinach to your smoothie, but you can't actually taste the spinach! The sweetness of the fruit covers up the spinach taste, so it is a great way to eat your vegetables without tasting them.<br /><br />You can make a health shake anytime from the comforts of your own home, simply put some fruits and vegetables in the blender (along with a little bit of water), blend it all together and enjoy!
