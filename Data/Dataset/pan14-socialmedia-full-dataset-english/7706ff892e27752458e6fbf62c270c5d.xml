The art world is too catching on to the logic of offering bargains to a new breed of buyers who wish to make a foray into buying art but without the risk associated with big price tags. Hence, the entry of Affordable Art into the working vocabulary of the art world. We bring you insights into this relatively new phenomenon in the Indian art scene. Our Artist in Focus Jagannath Paul speaks through his art even as his works are displayed in a solo on-line show with bCA Galleries. Our regular features of Snippets and Art Extract will, we are certain, hold your interest and as always we welcome your suggestions and comments.
<br /><br />Affordable Art
<br /><br />Art- it serves many purposes in a person’s life – for some it is a piece of décor, for others it is a collectible item, for still others it is a matter of pride and prestige and for the intellectually inclined art feeds the soul. But if there is one thing that almost everyone agrees upon is that art is an expensive buy/investment and probably one of the things a person would consider buying only from their surplus disposable income. 
<br /><br />Recognizing this fact, there are now several efforts being made by the art fraternity to make art more ‘affordable’ and hence available to more people. Here one is not talking about the pavement prints that are honestly quite down-market and crass but rather art in its true sense.
<br /><br />Probably one of the first experiments of bringing affordability into the realm of art is the Affordable Art Fair. Founded by Will Ramsay 1999, the mission of the fair is to make contemporary art accessible to everyone while doing away with the notion that only millionaires could buy and enjoy art. Since the concept first launched 12 years ago, more than one million people have visited the fairs buying almost 150 million pounds of art. 
<br /><br />The USP of the Affordable Art Fair is that each fair has a fixed price ceiling, making buyers aware of the accessibility of the art. Also, there is a vast variety of art on sale catering to all tastes. Moreover, the fairs have workshops etc which are not only for the adults but also children and have a more relaxed atmosphere than the more conventional art fairs. Currently the Affordable Art Fair is organized in over 15 cities worldwide and is also planning its first Indian outing in Delhi this year – a long way from its origins in Battersea Park in London. The Affordable Art Fair not only gives novice collectors a chance to wet their feet but also offers a platform for emerging artists – besides who knows one may just purchase a future masterpiece!
<br /><br />Closer home, in Mumbai as well, galleries are waking up to the fact that affordable art is the way to go. Even one of the vanguards of the art scene in Mumbai, Sakshi Galelry has bought into the affordability scene. They recently hosted a show that focused on artworks that were within the ‘easy buy’ realm, though the highest priced artwork was still at a stiff Rs 3.5 lakh for a Jogen Chowdhury black and white charcoal drawing. However, the affordability factor at the Sakshi show focuses more on prints and posters, with a few original works that come within the ambit of the price factor that can make them affordable. 
<br /><br />Other galleries who wish to cash in on the trend of affordable art prefer to do shows with upcoming artists. Some galleries are even catching young artists who are barely out of art school. Galelry Pradarshak is one such gallery which hosted the show Vidhyarthi Vishesh featuring works by sixty students from art schools in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Kolhapur, Varanasi, Latur, Sangli and Gadhchiroli. Prices at the show ranged from Rs 1,000 – Rs 35,000 low enough to tempt a first time buyer and also encourage an art collector to take a chance on a budding new artist. Further, a more localized version of the Affordable Art Fair was hosted by the Arctic Vision Art Gallery at Goregaon in Mumbai where over 300 artworks were priced between Rs 200 – Rs 25,000.

<br /><br />Indian Masters Score at International Auctions
<br /><br />Vespers I, by modern Indian artist Jehangir Sabavala has sold for more than 250,000 pounds by auctioneers Bonhams at their annual summer sale of Modern and Contemporary South Asian art in London. The estimated value of the work was £100,000-150,000, but it was finally sold for 253,650 pounds. Illustrated on the cover of his monograph by Ranjit Hoskote, 'The Crucible of Painting: The Art of Jehangir Sabavala”, Vespers I is one of Sabavala's most important works, representing a key period of transition in the artist's oeuvre. Indian painter Tyeb Mehta’s Mahishasura, 1996, the most important painting from his ground-breaking series, was sold for £1.385 million by Christie’s in London on 11th June 2012. The painting had been estimated to sell for between £1.2 million and £1.8 million. Mehta’s Mahishasura was the first Indian contemporary painting to have crossed the million-dollar barrier in 2005 when it was sold for nearly $1.6 million. The Tyeb painting is “heavily inspired by ancient mythology and Hindu literature, Mahishasura recounts the legend whereby the Brahmin demon-king Rambha produces an invincible son through his union with a she-buffalo.”

<br /><br />Artist in Focus – Jagannath Paul
<br /><br />Jagannath Paul is an artist who has risen through the ranks. From humble beginnings of showing his works in theatre lobbies, he has created a niche style of his own that can be recognised instantly. Moreover, he has managed to capture the elusive emotional connect with his viewers which marks a true artist. We engage in a conversation with the artist, who more often than not prefers to let his work do the talking. 
<br /><br />What inspired you to become an artist? 
<br />I was always interested in art related activities be it making clay idols, paintings etc. When I was a kid I used to make idols in my spare times. So, it was there in my soul right from childhood.
<br /><br />Was your family supportive in your decision? Most parents prefer their children to have stable careers. 
<br />Honestly speaking my family never pressurized me for choosing any career of their choice. In that way I am very fortunate that I had complete liberty for pursuing career my own choice.
<br /><br />Who do you think of as role models in the art field?
<br />I was always inspired by the work of the great artist Jamini Roy.
<br /><br />You are one of the first artists to use charcoal on canvas - how difficult is the medium to work with?
<br />It is always challenging when you experiment with new medium especially when there you are trying something revolutionary. You always need to think about people expectations. Initially I also faced some difficulties which is quite natural. What is most satisfactory is when you get appreciation for your work. 
<br /><br />One remembers seeing your works being sold almost 15 years ago in theatre lobbies - has the journey to becoming an established artist been a difficult one?
<br />I have enjoyed my journey..
<br /><br />Have you always been enamored by the figurative and this play with shadows in your work? Did you experiment with abstract or sculpture as well? 
<br />As an artist you should experiment with every form of work be it abstract, shadow effect painting or making sculpture or mural. I enjoy art in all its form.
<br /><br />Your creativity is directed in which direction - self realization or what the buyers expect from you?
<br />I feel it is the self realization that inspires you how you want to see the world. For me the priority always lies how you make others to see from your viewpoint. 
<br /><br />The art market keeps going through high and low phases, how do you, as an artist, face that? Do you adjust your prices accordingly?
<br />I never bother about the market prices to evaluate my work. Fortunately I never had to.
<br /><br />In your opinion, when has an artist become established - does it have to do with price and crossing the 1 lakh mark, or getting international recognition? 
<br />There is no such benchmark which makes one established. It is rather the connection you make with your buyer which brings you closer to them that makes you famous or established in your words. 
<br /><br />Where would you like to see yourself in the next 10 years?
<br />I would like to continue with exploring new ideas and forms to contribute more towards the art of painting through my works. 
<br />There you have it, Jagananth Paul, a man of few words who lets his art do the talking and those evocative and haunting images that he creates certainly do engage in a conversation with the viewer that transcends language!

<br /><br />Interesting Exhibitions seen in the past 3 months
<br /><br />Solo show by J Nandkumar at Jehangir Art Gallery
<br /><br />Paramesh Paul at Nehru Centre
<br /><br />Solo show by J Nandkumar at Jehangir Art Gallery
<br /><br />Dedicating this exhibition to M F Hussain, J Nandkumar is raising a few hackles amongst the self-proclaimed censors, similar to the negativity that forced Hussain to leave India. It is no wonder then that the themes that he chooses to render in his paintings also bear close resemblance to those of Hussain. Another similarity is the bold lines with which he create his paintings. In fact, even in his abstract works there is a powerful emotional force which grips the viewer, the bold colours; the strong, almost harsh strokes are quite captivating. 
<br /><br />Paramesh Paul at Nehru Centre
<br /><br />The peace and tranquility of a bathing ghat at Benares is captured most appropriately by Paramesh Paul in his ethereal landscapes. What is amazing is the use of light in his works which take us through the different phases of the day in the city that he seems to idolize. At a time when most artists prefer to move away from the creation of landscapes, Paul's works bring back the magic of the art-form that once captivated the attention of art-lovers across continents. Though his works have a typical Indian setting they still have a universal appeal and even without the religious connotations that Benares brings to mind, they instill the viewer with an other worldliness and a sense of meditative peace. 
<br /><br />Vigyan Vrat’s solo show of paintings at Jehangir Art Gallery
<br /><br />There is lore of different dimensions co-existing in parallel universes. Somehow, Vigyan Vrat’s paintings bring to mind this sense of otherworldly dimensions. His paintings have depth which is created by using planes and angles which have an almost architectural precision. Yet, they are not rigid; there is ample movement and fluidity in the paintings which leads you to explore all the hidden nooks and crannies. And then one comes across, in some of the works, evidence of human inhabitancy where the figure seems to almost grow out of the work and merges and emerges as an entity that is not quite independent of its surroundings but is rather a product of them. There are a few times when the Jehangir Art Gallery hosts a show which is impressive and demands viewing and this is one of them.

<br /><br />Art Extract: : Lowbrow Art
<br /><br />As the name suggests, lowbrow art does not lay claim to any pseudo intellectual pursuits. Rather, it is often a sarcastic comment on the conventional art and the art establishment. This was a movement which began in the ‘90s and tends to be all encompassing, including comics, music album covers, graphics, animation etc. There tend to be rather surreal and imaginary scenarios represented in lowbrow art – it challenges the mind of the viewer even while making the impossible seem probable. Most lowbrow art incorporates contemporary issues, images and movements into it’s art, thus it feels the pulse of the people and offers a greater connect than ‘intellectual or highbrow’ art. However, this also means that its relevance and meaning has to be understood with regard to and within the ambit of the culture and time period of when it was created. A high percentage of lowbrow artists are self-taught and have not had formal training or formal connections to the art world. There are a few galleries like the Varnish Gallery in San Francisco and the CoproGallery in LA that are committed to lowbrow art, but given its anti-establishment nature, lowbrow art is yet find pride of place in museums.

<br />        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indian Art – Truly ‘Symbolic’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />        &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
<br />          &lt;img alt=&quot;Symbols in Indian art&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bcagalleries.com%2Fimages%2FbNLQ408%2FSymbols.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcagalleries.com/images/bNLQ408/Symbols.jpg&quot</a>; width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;143&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />        &lt;p&gt;Right from the time of the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbols have been an important tool for conveying thoughts and ideas between individuals. While some symbols have been closely guarded secret to be shared only between members of a particular sect, others have been more or less universal. Artists have also used symbols to define a thought process in their art. The best seller The Da Vinci Code would have us believe that all of Leonardo Da Vinci’s works were in a sense a symbolic subterfuge and encrypted messages being passed onto a secret society. Indian art too is replete with symbols. In fact in India art symbols tend to be associated with superstitions believed to attract good fortune and repel evil.&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          We could enumerate some of the more common symbols that recur in Indian art and their associated ideologies:&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Dot (Bindu):&lt;/strong&gt; The dot, in its many variations is the most common and oft use symbol in Indian art, and still finds pride of place in contemporary art. It is regaled by Indian philosophers as source of light and energy. Besides, most all creative activity, be it writing or painting originate from a point or a single nucleus. It has also been used to define a point of meditation where you focus all your energies on that one point or ‘dot’ in front of you oblivious to all. The artist who has immortalised the ‘bindu’ in contemporary art is S H Raza, who used it along with other geometric forms to create his artworks. When rendered as a circle, the dot can also be interpreted to mean infinity and wholeness. It is the shape of all celestial bodies like the sun and moon and also represents divinity. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Lotus&lt;/strong&gt;: This is one that is very visible in most sculptures, carvings on temple walls and used by artists even today to denote purity. The logic is simple – just as the lotus grows in muck and marshy water but rises above it and retains its pristine colours, so too do enlightened souls remain pure and ethereal even while living in the world where corruption and violence abound. The Hindu god of creation Brahma is always shown seated on a lotus. At the same time, when a lotus bud is rendered in a semi-open state it represents spiritual realisation. When teamed with Goddess Laxmi (the goddess of wealth), a cascade of lotus buds represents plenty. A simile sometimes drawn between the lotus and the feet of God, for the Mahayana sect of Buddhists, every soul emerges from a lotus. Though the lotus is a predominantly Hindu symbol, it also finds pride of place in Mughal miniatures and sculptural carvings. In fact, the Taj Mahal, the pride of Indian architecture was built by a Muslim ruler and its central dome is designed as an inverted lotus resting on its petals. Little wonder then that the lotus is India’s national flower.&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Sun (Surya):&lt;/strong&gt; The Sun represents everlasting glory. It was used extensively on the shields and insignia of royalty. There is sometimes a conjugal representation of the sun and moon in some sculptures and paintings, the symbolism stems from the fact that these two celestial bodies are believed to be immortal and even today when some great personality or hero is remembered the slogan chanted is, “as long as there are the sun and the moon, you will live forever in our thoughts” (rough translation). In contemporary Indian art, the sun still finds place as a symbolic representation. Another interpretation for the Sun is an agent of purification. The sun’s rays can burn all impure objects; homes are often opened to allow the sun’s rays to enter in the day time, where the sun is considered a ‘mitra’ or friend of the living. Even the ‘suryanamaskar’ a yogic pose offers homage to the Sun and its healing powers – destroying all that is decadent and impure. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Wheel (Chakra):&lt;/strong&gt; The wheel is a symbol closely related to the sun. In some art it is used to represent the sun as it traverses the skies. In the famous Konark Sun Temple in the Indian state of Orissa, the Sun God is shown travelling across the heavens in this chariot, the focal point of the temple are it decorated wheels. The wheel can also be interpreted to mean destruction as the Hindu God Vishnu is believed to use his ‘chakra’ to vanquish evil demons. In the annals of meditation, the chakra represents the centre of psychic energy in the body. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Swastik: &lt;/strong&gt;This is one symbol that evokes myriad emotions in people across the world, depending upon which culture you hail from. For the Indians it represents something most holy, every household will have a swastika at the doorway. It is said to represent the Sun and the four directions. The Swastik also represents creativity and continuity, the symbol is believed to be derived from the weaving of baskets where the ends of a simple cross design are turned to the right to form a swastika. For the Europeans who have lived through the Second World War, the Swastik represents of the Nazis and their racistic ideology. For them the Swastik stood for &quot;race emblem of Germanism&quot;, the reason why the German Swastik ‘moved’ in a direction opposite to the Indian one is because it was it was interpreted as the representation of the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work, which as such always has been and always will be anti-Semitic [Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler]&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Pot (Kalash):&lt;/strong&gt; The Kalash or the Indian pot is yet another symbol used extensively in decorating Indian architecture and also in contemporary art. The ‘pot’ cannot be considered uniquely Indian though as it has been symbolically associated with other riverside civilizations. The pot is always considered to be filled with water, in some instances it be rendered with water or milk flowing from it. In all instances the pot represents fertility and the source of life. Sometimes the pot may have the symbols of two eyes across it, this can be interpreted to mean divinity and omniscience of even denote day and night. It also represents the contradictory concepts of fragility and strength which is how we view the concept of Nature. The earthen pot has for this reason been chosen as the symbol of the Ecomark – eco-friendly logo for products by the Indian government. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;Footprints:&lt;/strong&gt; Through the ages, Gods have been represented in Indian art in the form of footprints. They are specially used to depict the Hindu God Vishnu – the protector. The Buddhists also use the footprint symbol to represent the Buddha. This symbol is sometimes rendered in the form of the ‘padukam’ or ‘khadau’ – the traditional name for the wooden Indian slipper.&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;The Tree:&lt;/strong&gt; This is one symbol that is universal across the globe, representing life, hope, prosperity. It is seen as a link between the earth, the heavens and the netherworld. The tree with its rejuvenating properties is also seen as a symbol of health. The Indian art normally depicts a banyan tree which is symbolic of growth and prosperity. When the peepul tree is depicted it takes in religious tones as with the Bodhi tree which is equated with knowledge by the Buddhists as it was under this tree that the Buddha is believed to have received enlightenment. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;strong&gt;Snakes:&lt;/strong&gt; The serpent is regarded differently as the divine and the harbinger of death. The snake symbol represents power, sexuality and rejuvenation. The snake in Indian art is also regarded as a protector and guardian. The symbol of two serpents intertwined represents fertility. The snake symbol is a particularly potent one as it combines strength with danger.&lt;br/&gt;
<br />          &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          There are other symbols that have been employed in Indian art through the ages and are still used today albeit in a more contemporary form. The artists can have their own reasoning behind employing a certain symbol as well. But when it comes to traditional art, each symbol tells its own story and when one reads the logic behind the symbol, the pictographic story reveals itself to us quite clearly. At festival time, like Diwali (the festival of lights in the month of October), many Indian households create patterns from powdered limestone on the threshold and use these age-old symbols which will welcome good energies and repel evil from their homes. &lt;br/&gt;
<br />          In fact, we at &lt;strong&gt;
<br />            &lt;span class=&quot;bfntcolor&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
<br />            &lt;span class=&quot;cafntclr&quot;&gt;CA &lt;/span&gt;
<br />            &lt;span class=&quot;whttxt&quot;&gt;Galleries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have used the ‘&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bfntcolor&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’ in our gallery name to denote the ‘bee’. As it represents cooperation, diligence and productivity, it symbolizes our company, its staff and its work ethic completely! &lt;/p&gt;

		<document id="58e1863c23dd4b45f811834762b51fcd" url=""><![CDATA[The Indian-ness of Art!<br/><br/>As the headlines screamed controversies surrounding M F Hussain acceptance of Qatari citizenship, one stops to wonder at this strange ‘possessiveness’ that seemed to have gripped the Indian media. At age 95 Hussain, a nomad at heart, had been reduced to the status of a refugee. His country of birth and nationality was no longer a safe place given that he had inadvertently hurt the sentiments of fundamental religious groups. 
<br /><br />Without derailing into the mire of artistic freedom and censorship, let us consider that it was but human of Hussain to need a sense of security and belonging. It raises another question; does the fact that he now is a Qatar national make his art any less Indian? Does an artist’s passport lead to an automatic compartmentalisation of his art? 
<br />In today’s global amalgamation while cultural differences do exist, there seems to a greater desire amongst artists to break free of the strings of national boundaries and enter into a state of flux with global sensitivities. There is an ‘artistic osmosis’ as it were where ideas and concepts move fluidly and without restraint across borders – a parallel a-political universe as it were. 
<br /><br />This is seen best in the case of artworks created by the Indian diaspora of contemporary artists who share their common lineage but have also grown into the cultures of their adoptive countries. What emerges therefore is art that cannot be explicitly stamped as ‘Made in India’ but does have strong Indian overtones. Take for instance the works of Chitra Ganesh who while using tales out of the popular Indian children’s comics, ‘Amar Chitra Katha’ nevertheless speaks a global language through her works.
<br /><br />Does the artist’s name decide if his art is Indian? If this were true then perhaps one of the most famous British artists with an Indian name – Anish Kapoor, should have all his works labelled Indian! Which anyone who has seen his sculptures that redefine space and light would vehemently refute. Or does it have to do with the physical boundary within which art is created? Most of S H Raza’s and those of Sakti Burman are created in France; does that make their art French? Raza had once said, “I have not let go of anything that is important from my own country. I've remained Indian, not become French!”
<br /><br />Speaking of the French, Ariane Mercier (an artist associated with bCA Galleries) though being a French national creates artworks that employ the style of miniature paintings and are replete with Indian imagery. Her delicately balanced works speak of the colours and life of Rajasthan where she studied Indian art with Mahaveer Swami and has even exhibited her works with him. Seeing their works in unison one realizes the effect of a new culture and style fusing with an artist’s personal experiences and background. 
<br /><br />Besides how ‘Indian’ is Indian art anyway? This is a country that has seen a steady stream of invaders who have then set up base in the country – Indian art is nothing if not an amalgamation of global influences. This process began from the time of the Mughals with Persian calligraphic and palette influences seeping into traditional Indian folk art. Indian art has not remained immune to other Asian influences as elements from China and Japan are seen especially in Buddhist art. There are instances of Chinese lacquer ware to be seen in the works of Anjolie Ela Menon as well. The British brought their own sense of style and rendering. In fact much of modern day contemporary art is a reflection of European influence as most art schools still continue with the erstwhile standards of teaching. In this sense, Indian art though having its roots in a common cultural ethos still cannot be termed ‘purely Indian’ in its style and execution. In fact, if defined in those terms only the traditional arts such as Warli and Madhubani remain now Indian in an ‘unblemished’ manner.
<br /><br />In an interview, Atul Dodiya, one of the most recognisable names of Indian contemporary art had said, “Ultimately, only that art which is strongly rooted will have universal appeal. I live in Mumbai and it is from this perspective that I create. Ultimately, all art is culture-specific yet has many cross-cultural references.&quot;
<br />An artist, in a childlike manner, will but speak the language he has grown with. The bounty of experiences and wealth of traditions that Indian artists are exposed to will necessarily influence their art and form the foundation of their artwork. A purposeful and deliberate use of Indian symbology does not make a painting Indian, the hidden language that the work speaks definitely does. 
<br /><br />As Husain Saab makes Qatar his adopted home during his final years his son, filmmaker-writer-painter Owais Husain, says, “... You can take M.F. Husain out of India. But you can’t take India out of M F Husain.”

Thus, while 2008 and 2009 were possibly the worst years in this decade for art, 2010 is witnessing an upswing as fortunes in stock and other allied markets improve. 
<br />The main indicators of this resurrection of the art market are the auction results for art since the beginning of 2010. While galleries are still not very transparent in their dealings, the auction houses present a complete transparency and pricing and hence allow for comparisons between the years as well. 
<br /><br />International Art Market
<br />Internationally, Christie’s and Sotheby’s are considered the primary auction houses. Both have registered marked improvements in 2010 both in terms of number of lots sold as well as the hammer prices of artworks. Records are now being broken again as art is reinstated in the news columns. A publication by OSIAN’s Art Market India Report (AMIR) reveals the market share of Christie’s has increased to 38.7% from the corresponding share of 27.2% from Jan 1 to March 27 2009. Sotheby’s increased its market share from 22.9% in 2009 to 23.7% in 2010. The total auction sales in 2010 were to the tune of Rs.105.11 crore compared to Rs.45.07 crore in 2009.
<br /><br />In May 2010, at the end of the Impressionist &amp; Modern Art sales on 4 &amp; 5 May, Christie’s and Sotheby’s posted a combined revenue higher by 205% compared with the previous year’s total and their combined results from the Contemporary Art sales (11 and 12 May) were nearly 230% better than the previous year. The bought-in rates were much lower than previous years ranging between 6% (Sotheby’s Contemporary Art sale) to 22% (Christie’s Impressionist &amp; Modern Art sale). Twelve new records were set including a new world record for a work of art at auction, for Picasso’s lascivious painting of Marie-Thérèse Walter entitled Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, at $95 million which was auctioned at Christie’s. On 11th May 2010, in the Contemporary Art segment, Christie’s sold 74 contemporary works for $202.3m with only 8% of the works offered remaining unsold. The following day, the 50 lots sold by Sotheby’s generated total revenue of $166.2m with only 6% of the works offered remaining unsold. As a result of these proceedings, Artprice’s confidence index (the AMCI) has stabilised at around 24 points.
<br /><br />Chinese Art Market
<br />Even Chinese art is doing well with a painting by Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), one of China's best-known 20th-century painters, being sold for a record 100.8 million yuan ($14.8 million), at a spring auction of China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd. on 17th May 2010, the highest auction price ever for any modern Chinese painting or calligraphic work. 
<br /><br />A price surpassing 100 million yuan for an ancient or modern painting or calligraphic work has opened a new era, and once it has been opened, there are new expectations.
<br />Prices for Chinese works—ancient or modern paintings or calligraphic works—still have some room to grow.” His words were proved true by the sale of a calligraphy scroll by Huang Tingjian (1045-1105), a well-known calligraphist and poet in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), which fetched 436.8 million yuan ($64 million) at the spring auction of the Poly International Auction Co. Ltd. On 3rd June 2010, a world record price for a single piece of Chinese artwork.
<br />With the oil price gaining strength the market expects a return of the buyers from the Moddle East, Chinese and Russian investors are further expected to boost the current effervescence of the art scene.
<br /><br />Indian Art Market
<br />Closer home, the Indian art market has been mirroring the global trend. According to Neville Tuli, founder-chairman of OSIAN’s Connoisseurs of Art, “the Indian art market has witnessed a period of consolidation in 2010 and the coming months will see further strengthening. In the coming months, buyers will witness resurgence in demand for the best of art works by the leading masters in India.” Saffronart increased its share to 19.8% in 2010 from 17.5% in 2009.
<br />The summer online auction by Saffronart has been a resounding success sending strong signals through the Indian art market. “Fifty-three per cent lots sold for above the higher estimate, and 10 lots sold for over a crore each, pointing to a broad level of interest across the auction,” says Dinesh Vazirani, CEO and Co-founder of Saffronart. Amongst the artworks that captured the buyer’s interest and made art history were Jehangir Sabavala’s “The Casuarina Line” which sold at Rs 1.7 crores far exceeding the pre-sale estimate of Rs. 50 lakh, a record for this artist. S. H. Raza’s “La Provence Noire” went under the hammer at Rs. 3.3 crore the highest fetched by the auction house in this season’s sale, followed by an untitled work by Subodh Gupta which sold for Rs. 2.2 crore. M. F. Husain’s untitled work fetched the highest value sold via mobile, at Rs 1.06 crores and another of his work “8 horses” sold for Rs. 2 crores.
<br /><br />While an untitled work by V. S. Gaitonde fetched Rs 1.5 crores, N. S. Harsha’s “We Don’t Know Why We Are Stitching Plants” went for Rs 1.27 crores. Gaitonde, Souza and Akbar Padamsee were among the 10 lots which fetched over Rs. one crore in the two day sales on June 16-17.
<br /><br />73 of the total 90 works on offer were sold successfully, grossing a total of Rs. 30 crores.
<br />The reports and results from across the globe point to the recovery of the art market. One can only hope that galleries that were forced to take a sabbatical, such as the Bodhi gallery which had closed all its international as well as Indian branches, will soon again become major players in the art field and emerging artists who were forced to lie low will get their due.

<br /><br />Art 41 Basel: This year’s Art Basel (June 16th – 20th) saw the coming of age of Indian art galleries, with 5 being invited to participate from the final cut of 308. In earlier years it was only Delhi based Gallery Nature Morte promoted by American Peter Nagy which had participated at international art fairs. Joining him this year for Art 41 Basel are Shereen Gandhy of Chemold Prescott Road, Tara Lal and Mortimer Chatterjee of Chatterjee and Lal, Sunitha Kumar Emmart of GallerySKE and Geetha Mehra of Sakshi. Nagy welcomes greater participation of the Indian galleries, in an interview he stated, “participation and a continued presense ar Art Basel are important to build confidence in this market.” In the Arts Statement sector which showcases emerging artists, the works of Nikhil Chopra (Chatterjee &amp; Lal) and Sreshta Premnath (GallerySKE) will be finding pride of place among the other 26 international artists. Chemold is playing it safe with established artist Atul Dodiya while Nature Morte will be promoting works y Aditya Pande, Seher Shah and Suhasini Kejriwal along with Atul Dodiya. Sakshi, surprisingly chooses to give Indian talent a miss and promote Taiwanese artist Chen Chieh-Jen instead. 
<br /><br />2010 French Open Poster: Did you ever think international tennis and Indian art would ever have anything in common! Well, an Indian artist – Nalini Malani - was commissioned to design the official French Open Poster – forget Indian, she is the first Asian to do so! Malani describes her work as, “the player is striding the universe, one foot on each planet. The butterflies represent the magical space. On the court there is the moment of high, but also the undertow that you might not succeed everytime.” Malani’s string point is that she is able to articulate themes that are universal. She herself believes that, “I do not believe in art for art’s sake. In the three-way relationship between the artist, the viewer and the work of art, we are talking about communication through the medium of art.”
<br /><br />Raza’s Painting sets new record for Indian Art: The sale of Syed Haider Raza's work 'Saurashtra' at Christie's in London for Rs. 16 crore, has made it the highest price ever paid for any Indian artwork at an auction. The two-day sale of South Asian modern and contemporary art held by Christie's, which included property from The Estate of Francis Newton Souza of India, was 98 per cent sold by value and 91 per cent sold by lot. The sale on Thursday broke the record of Francis Newton Souza's 1955 painting, called Birth, which in June 2008 sold for £1,273,250, a world record for Indian modern and contemporary work of art till now. The Head of South Asian art at Christie's Yamini Mehta said the previous record for Indian modern and contemporary art was a tie between Francis Newton Souza and Raza at about 2 and half million dollars which had been breached. The second highest price at the auction was recorded by Tyeb Mehta's Falling bird selling at well over 8 crores. Six new Artist World Auction Record Prices were set, including Aisha Khalid, Sunil Gawde, Naiza Khan, Imran Qureshi, and Saren Pors/Aparna Rao. Raza’s work was purchased by an Indian and is headed back to India to be part of an Indian museum.

<br /><br />Artist in Focus – Ritesh Meshram 
<br /><br />While most artists find their comfort zone and refuse to move out of it, Ritesh Meshram comes across as a maverick who is immersed in innovation and experimentation. He is an artist who enjoys the process of creativity as much as its end result, often leaving a work at a point where it still retains a sense of mystery for the viewer. Being associated with a gallery such as Chemold has given him an opportunity to grow from strength to strength. We delve into his world:
<br /><br />What inspired you to become an artist?
<br /><br />I had joined a theatre group in 1991 called the IPA. I found acting a perfect way to air my strong political views, through the medium of street plays etc. The people of my generation had an ambition to see art in the ‘classic view’. The plays initially had a very direct message we tried to introduce art in design and subject within a socio-political context. It was at time that I started painting for the creation of the sets, posters etc. I later thought of honing my artistic skills further, as I really wasn’t into academics and joined the Indira Sangeet Vishwas Vidyalay in Kheragad. After 4 years I received fellowship at HRD and so I came to Mumbai. 
<br /><br />Do you feel ‘connections’ work in the art field?
<br /><br />I personally do not feel that way, at least not in a city like Mumbai. I find here that your work speaks for itself and every artist reaches a place that he deserves. For instance, I never applied to Chemold, in fact one feels that initially for a struggling artist it would be pointless to approach such a gallery, but the whole process of my work has got me in here. Thanks to Sandra Khare (who is deputy director at Chemold Art Gallery) who came across my work and decided to exhibit them at the gallery. 
<br /><br />After having exhibited with an established gallery like Chemold would you define yourself as a ‘recognised artist’ in Indian Contemporary art?
<br /><br />It is very difficult for me to understand how one defined a ‘recognised artist’ – is it how famous or well known he is or is it how much money his paintings are sold for. There are some who resort to sensationalism but I do not think that is important for an artist to make a name for himself. What I do know is that even though the past two years have been tough, it is this city’s energy that is making me enjoy my work and making it fun. 
<br /><br />Your initial works dealt with rendering machines and their designs in a new perspective, then for some time you incorporated natural elements like seeds, plants, water to convey your perception and thoughts. Now, once again one finds your works immersed in mechanizations. Why this constant vacillation between two essentially disparate subjects?
<br /><br />I would say there is a lot of nostalgia in my works. I come from Bhilai which is a town that is a recognized steel centre in India. At the same time it has still retained the trappings of a village with nature and fields co-existing with steel factories. Hence as I have grown up with an exposure to both; both these worlds find place in my art. 
<br /><br />You are one of the few contemporary artists who does not chose to ‘find his preferred medium and stick with it;’ rather one finds you constantly experimenting with mediums ranging from water colours, acrylics, charcoal, video installations, installations and sculptures. Why this restlessness in exploring mediums?
<br /><br />The time period in which I live and create art is such that it would be a type of romanticism for me to be stuck only with painting. I feel that this is a very experimental time for art and if I were to get stuck with one medium I would not be able to do more. I like to play with mediums; this is the first time I have done sculptures as I find myself leaning toward the 3-dimensional form. Over the past two years I have been working on video installations, later I want to do street installations as I feel that the message will reach a wider audience on the street. 
<br /><br />Have you ever created art keeping its ‘marketability’ in mind?
<br /><br />I have never worked by the market. It’s true that there is a greater design element in my work now but even that is not from the point of view of selling the work. What I do think of while working is enjoyment I get from hiding the clear narrative. 
<br /><br />The recession has affected many in the art field adversely. Also, many struggling artists turn to teaching or commercial projects to supplement their income. Have you ever had to make such a decision?
<br /><br />I have never felt the need, mainly because I am very practical. It is not true that if you do not have money you cannot work. I have worked with mediums that are essentially cheaper when faced with a cash crunch, for instance for a year I worked only with the ink-pen, I have done a series with charcoal on paper.
<br />Ritesh Meshram is an artist who is as complex as his works – someone who is emotional about the very first work he sold, as well as practical; someone who clings to his roots and yet is not afraid to experiment. We are certain that his future works will continue to enthrall viewers.

<br /><br />Interesting Exhibitions seen in the past 3 months 
<br /><br />Twinkle Khanna and Rajesh Khanna at Timeless Beauty-Prithvi Soni 
<br /><br />Timeless Beauty at Jehangir Art Gallery 
<br /><br />Figurative art still has its ardent fans and especially in India and the sub-continent, it continues to attract art aficionados. There was ample proof of this at Prithvi Soni's latest exhibition with yesteryear's super star Rajesh Khanna and his daughter Twinkle gracing the exhibition. The artist creates artworks that have an ethereal quality to them. The women in his paintings are reminiscent of the 'apsaras' in Indian mythology. He also often sets them against splendorous backgrounds drawing the viewer into a different age and era - this is Indian art in all its glory and what the kings of yore had promoted.
<br /><br />Urban Abstracts at Hacienda Art Gallery
<br /><br />Using their own intrinsic artistic sense, four photographers have captured images of the city that have a decidedly abstract quality to them. This is not a straight shoot and print show, but delves into the hidden spaces and angles that show the city in a different light through the photographers mind. Vishwanath Mishra is enamoured by the cities walls and in particular the graffiti, posters and scribbles that become a part of the wall, each old fragment giving way to the new. Other photographers in the show are Ramesh Mashru who captures the architectural elements of Mumbai’s buildings, Tarun Karve whose compositions have a design element quite unique to photography and Arun Kumar who uses a play of light to create an image that pulsates with rhythm. The show has been curated by Jagdish Agarwal.
<br /><br />Group Show at The Museum Gallery
<br /><br />One could say that this is the week when sculptures seem to triumph over paintings. Clearly in this group show the sculptures by Ratan Saha and Sachin Choudhari are quite exquisite and well executes. They manage to merge good technique with aesthetics and while they may not present much of a ‘message’ they depict their subject of choice to perfection. In the case of Saha he chooses the ‘Bull’ as the subject of his works and just when one was thinking that almost all ways of presenting this particular animal, that is so rooted in the Indian psyche have been exhausted, Saha surprises us. His bulls are of course powerful but he presents them also in the style of a temple decoration, an exhausted laboured animal, a proud, relentless spirit – amazing work. Choudhari skips the fauna and prefers to depict flora in his wooden sculptures which seem to grow before your eyes in myriad shapes of mushrooms and toadstools – one could almost imagine a fantasy landscape. Compared to these, the artworks lining the walls seem tired and one can barely spare them a glance.

<br /><br />Art Extract: Digital Art
<br /><br />Digital art is essentially defined as any artistic work that utilises digital technology in its creation. It has heeb alternatively referred to as ‘computer or multimedia art.’ Today the scope of digital art has expanded under the broad term of ‘new media art.’ Perhaps one of the firt known displays of digital art was by Andy Warhol, the ‘Pope of Pop Art’ in July 1985 at the Lincoln Center where he displayed art created using Amiga paint software.
<br />According to the Digital Fine Arts Society of New Mexico, the various types of Digital Fine Art are defined as follows:
<br /><br />Digital Photography: The artist uses a digital or conventional camera. The photographs are digitized and translated to the computer environment where the artist uses image editing and special effects software to perform darkroom type manipulations. 
<br /><br />Photopainting: This combines the disciplines of photography and painting. The artist uses image editing and paint software to go beyond dark room techniques to add further expression to the image.
<br /><br />Digital Collage: This is a technique of combining many images from varying sources into one image. This is most commonly achieved by the use of layering techniques in image editing and paint software. The artist may also use images from x-rays or radar to produce images that the eye does not normally see, which expands the realm of human perception.
<br /><br />Integrated Digital Art: This is the &quot;mixed media&quot; of the digital art world. Artists combine any number of the techniques to achieve unique results. The digital environment is much less restricted than conventional mediums in this type of integration and manipulation.
<br /><br />Digital Painting: This is further categorized as follows: 
<br /><br />2D: The artist creates 2D images totally in the computer virtual environment with the use of painting tools that emulate natural media styles; sometimes referred to as &quot;Natural Media&quot;. 
<br /><br />3D: The artist uses 3D modeling and rendering software to essentially sculpt in virtual space. This method also makes use of all of the other methods. 
<br /><br />Vector Drawing The artist uses vector drawing software and creates the image totally in the virtual environment. This makes use of shapes which are outlined and can be filled with various colors and patterns. This tends to produce a harder edged or graphic look. 
<br /><br />Algorithmic/Fractals: This is art produced exclusively by mathematical manipulations. This is the so-called &quot;computer generated&quot; art. The art here lies in the invention of the mathematical formulas themselves and the way the programs are written to take advantage of the display capabilities of the hardware. The art also lies in the creative intentions and subsequent selections of the artist/mathematician. 
<br /><br />Besides these, digital installations are also being exhibited by artists. One of the most memorable ones in recent time is the interactive new media art piece entitled “Screen” created by Noah Wardrip-Fruin. To view and interact with the piece, a user first enters a room, called the &quot;Cave,&quot; which is a virtual reality display area with four walls surrounding the participant. White memory texts appear on the background of black walls. Through bodily interaction, such as using one's hand, a user can move and bounce the text around the walls. The words can be made into sentences and eventually begin to &quot;peel&quot; off and move more rapidly around the user, creating a heightening sense of misplacement.
<br />There was resistance from the established art community to accepting digital art, not just because it uses ‘computer aided’ tools and techniques but also because of the erroneous perception of digital prints being endlessly reproducible. Many digital artists however, erase the files after a single print or specified number of prints are made, ensuringthat the artworks are unique. Today, with the improvements in quality of output and technological advances, the digital artworks even being collected by internatiola museums like the San Jose Museum of Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum which has a small collection of digital art in its print department.

<br /><br />This is a question that has plagued many an emerging artist, dealer and gallery. It is also one that every art collector should ask before purchasing an artwork. Art is one of the few purely ‘subjective products’ available in the market today. It is difficult to price art on the basis of ‘brick and mortar’ components alone – infinite elements like creativity, appeal and technique have to be taken into consideration. At auctions, an added element of the collector’s ego to own an artwork comes into play in pushing up prices for an artwork that would otherwise not be paid by the same collector in a gallery. There can never be an exact formula to determine the ‘right price’ of an artwork, but in this article we offer you the main variables that come into play while pricing art.
<br /><br />Pure Economics: There are those of the opinion who believe that the value of an artwork can be determined by a simple addition of various cost components to the artist. These include the basic cost of canvas, paints and other materials. The cost of rental of studio, exhibition hall etc; total the number of hours it took to complete the artwork, multiply that by the hourly wage one would perceive the artist’s time is worth. Add to this total 33% as gallery commission and you would have reached a ball park figure for the artwork.
<br /><br />Comparables: Another good way to reach a decision on the right price would be do some research. Find comparable artists who have similar level of training and education in art, create art in a similar genre and are contemporaries. There should be competitive pricing of the artwork under consideration, to be able to attract buyers.
<br /><br />Experience: It is but common sense that an artist who has had more shows, been represented at auctions and has a good demand for his artworks, would price them higher than one who is having his first show. Along with that, we would like to use ‘experience’ as an umbrella term that would also include the prestige of the art school attended, critical reviews of the artist’s works, awards that the artist may have won, participation in international art fairs, exhibitions etc.
<br /><br />Laws of demand: Even as we refer to the art ‘market’, it follows certain basic laws that are applicable in any marketplace. The demand for an artist’s works would necessarily determine the price and also consistent price hikes. Demand for art can be quantified by assuming that if at least half of all the artwork produced by an artist is sold within a six-month period, his/her art is in demand, such an artist would be justified in a 10-15% increase in his prices annually. 
<br /><br />Availability: Supply also plays a factor in determining prices; for instance the prices for an artist who can produce 10 works in a month would be lower than for an artist who painstakingly produces only 3 artworks a month. Moreover, if the artist is no longer alive then of course, prices would sky rocket.
<br /><br />Realistic: For an artist, dealer or gallery to maintain any credibility in the art market, pricing of artwork has to be realistic. While art buyers may bargain for artworks, the buffer maintained should not be more than 20%.
<br /><br />Emotional Connect: Sometimes an artist may make the mistake of pricing art according to the emotional connect he feels with the work or the angst he experienced while creating the work. An artwork should not be priced based on emotions – the artist cannot play on the fact that the subject is close to his heart or connected to his life and thus hike the price up. The buyer also need not be swayed by the artist’s emotions, if the artist has an emotional connect with the work then it should not be up for sale.
<br />Of course, art also tends to follow the vagaries of the global market, so one does have ‘boom’ periods when prices escalate beyond reasonable levels and then ‘bust’ periods when depression hits.
<br /><br />One cardinal rule for all artists is to maintain consistency in their pricing, they cannot have a different price for a gallery and a different one for ‘studio’ sales; else they could well find themselves struggling on their own with neither gallery or art dealer to support them. This consistency in prices also helps to build buyer confidence in the artist.
<br /><br />Fast Facts to ‘right price’ of art:
<br /><br />The costs of materials, rentals, artist time, gallery commission are the main ingredients to pricing of art 
<br /><br />Laws of demand and supply work in the art market 
<br /><br />Pricing of artists practicing similar genres and having similar experience levels should be comparable 
<br /><br />The more experienced and appreciated an artist, the higher his price 
<br /><br />Artworks are priced according to quality of the work and not emotions of the artist

<br /><br />Contemporary Art Gallery and Company
<br /><br />bCA Galleries wishes all its readers a prosperous 2011 and we hope
<br />that your joy will be immense and the inevitable problems –
<br />manageable! This issue we have chosen to shed some light upon the
<br />dark side of art – why is it that some artists choose to create
<br />works that disturb and sometimes even horrify the viewer? Our artist
<br />in focus – Michele Lombardelli’s art has also been referred to as
<br />‘disturbing’ by some and ‘fascinating’ by others. In keeping
<br />with the ‘theme’ we have also picked on Graffiti as the topic of
<br />Art Extract, this too has been a much maligned art form which has
<br />forced itself into recognition by the art world. As always, we look
<br />forward to suggestions, opinions and comments from our readers.

<br /><br />Contemporary Art Gallery and Company
<br /><br />bCA Galleries wishes all its readers a prosperous 2011 and we hope
<br />that your joy will be immense and the inevitable problems –
<br />manageable! This issue we have chosen to shed some light upon the
<br />dark side of art – why is it that some artists choose to create
<br />works that disturb and sometimes even horrify the viewer? Our artist
<br />in focus – Michele Lombardelli’s art has also been referred to as
<br />‘disturbing’ by some and ‘fascinating’ by others. In keeping
<br />with the ‘theme’ we have also picked on Graffiti as the topic of
<br />Art Extract, this too has been a much maligned art form which has
<br />forced itself into recognition by the art world. As always, we look
<br />forward to suggestions, opinions and comments from our readers.

<br /><br />Contemporary Art Gallery and Company
<br /><br />bCA Galleries wishes all its readers a prosperous 2011 and we hope
<br />that your joy will be immense and the inevitable problems –
<br />manageable! This issue we have chosen to shed some light upon the
<br />dark side of art – why is it that some artists choose to create
<br />works that disturb and sometimes even horrify the viewer? Our artist
<br />in focus – Michele Lombardelli’s art has also been referred to as
<br />‘disturbing’ by some and ‘fascinating’ by others. In keeping
<br />with the ‘theme’ we have also picked on Graffiti as the topic of
<br />Art Extract, this too has been a much maligned art form which has
<br />forced itself into recognition by the art world. As always, we look
<br />forward to suggestions, opinions and comments from our readers.

<br /><br />His solo exhibition, “The Triumphant ID” in Mumbai in 2006, generated much interest and media coverage. At the same time his art which then focused more on the elements of violence and death was found disturbing by most. As one art connoisseur had commented, “It’s very interesting work, but I would not be able to live with it!” Michele, a self-taught artist, has created a niche for himself in the art markets of Europe and USA, we find out more about the artist: 
<br /><br />How did you come to be interested in art?
<br /><br />In 1989 when I was 21 years old, during my first trip in Los Angeles, I visited the Los Angeles County Museum. This is one of the first times in a contemporary art museum for me, I remember exactly the room of Rothko and Kline from the Panza Collection. Probably this is my first step into art. Many years later, on 2005, my first solo show in Italy in a commercial gallery; was curated by Gianni Romano.
<br /><br />One would consider you a self taught artist, has it been difficult for you to gain an initial foothold in art field?
<br /><br />There have been a few hurdles, for example some applications for European or US studio programs are open only for Graduate student of Art. Otherwise it is not a problem.
<br /><br />Describe the first exhibition in which your works were displayed and your feelings at the time.
<br /><br />My first solo show was in 2005, with 38 drawings, 4 paintings and two black and white photos. Probably in most cases for artists the first solo show is when you are very young, but for me, the first show was when I was 37 years old, and the feelings were probably different. I remember the excitement for preparing the book (catalogue), also the 3/4 days for installation... Many artist and many collectors come to opening and I was very scared, because I don’t know the reaction. During the exhibition many works are sold, for many people the exhibition was good, and this is the time that I am beginning to think that I would to are an artist
<br /><br />Where do you get your inspiration for your art?
<br /><br />I don’t know exactly, probably from my daily life, books, music, films... all together, mixed in my mind.
<br /><br />Some, during your solo exhibition in India have referred to your work as ‘interesting but disturbing’ your reaction to that.
<br /><br />Absolutely not! I am happy because it is a “reaction”, many artworks are only “decorative”.
<br /><br />Your art style and colour choice seems to have metamorphosed over the years. Why and how did that happen?
<br /><br />My exhibitions now are more complex. I use also photos, sculptures, ceramics, and of course drawings and paintings. The “language” is mixed between abstract and figurative, and mixed into different media.
<br /><br />You are now associated with a galley in Milan, does this mean that you have a binding contract to show your works only through them? Is this the normal trend in Europe?
<br /><br />It is normal to have a contract with one main gallery and all works are controlled by then. In accordance with this main gallery the artist is free to organise shows with other galleries.
<br /><br />Now you work and sell your art in Milan and LA, do you find a difference in the way the art market functions, the reaction of collectors and art critics between the two continents?
<br /><br />Now the gallery is Los Angeles is closed for the market recession, for an artist in USA is very easy to come in the market as there are many collectors at any level.
<br /><br />Besides art, do you have other lateral project?
<br /><br />Yes, on 2009 I have recorded my first CD “Broken Guitars” with the Italian label Soundohm. It is guitar improvisations. And now a start to record my second CD for a Tokyo based label Meme.
<br /><br />As an artist, especially one who has experienced different art markets – Europe, USA, India, what do you feel needs to be done to further organise and structure the global art market?
<br /><br />USA and Europe is very close, perhaps in USA it is easier as there are more possibilities than in Europe. In March I had a solo project in the Volta fair in New York. Probably India and others country near the market is very different for many aspects: culture, religion, money, possibility. 
<br /><br />In what direction do you see your art developing over the next 10 years?
<br /><br />This is very difficult to answer, my interests change with my life.

Bowing to the dictates of a predominantly patriarchal society, the woman was assigned the role of a homemaker, nurturer, a wife, a mother and at times a lover. Indian art and artists has mirrored the social status of women, which is why though most of Indian art does have women as the central theme, their portrayal is often one-dimensional. 
<br />The Ajanta paintings are the most famous in the history of Indian art. Here too the ‘heroines’ of the works are portrayed as voluptuous temptresses, stressing on the fertility aspect in their ample curves. This trend is further elaborated in the Mauryan, Buddhist art styles...the ideal of female beauty was always the broad-hipped child-bearing woman. If women were ever depicted as having power, it was always in the sexual sense - the sculptures of the women in Khajuraho frescos are assured and supremely confident in their sexuality. Yet, even in these depictions, we can glimpse the importance of women in Indian history and mythology. Essentially Indian Gods were nothing without their consorts who were considered the goddesses of wisdom, learning and wealth. A woman was a true ‘ardhangini’ or ‘better half’. Raja Ravi Varma, one of the well known artists of Indian art, portrayed the divine aspect of women, their joy of being alive, as well as the home maker aspect. For him the perfect Indian woman was the dutiful daughter, the loving mother, the ideal homemaker.
<br />This image of women changed with the Mughal period in art where women were closeted behind walled gardens and heavily veiled. The woman was relegated to a decorative item, no thought, no emotion, just she and the birds and her hand maidens in blossoming alcoves, in pretty Mughal miniatures - Typical of the times and the thoughts of the rulers! History has no record of any Mughal queen who dominated Indian politics or society. The legendary Mumtaz Mahal is only immortalised as the favourite queen of Shah Jehan in the Taj Mahal. 
<br />The British ‘Raj’ in India brought with it a heightened sense of morality; scantily dressed women were now out. A baroque and posed, almost stiff portrayal of figures and women in art was ushered in. But this was also the time when women began to be exposed to an education. Amrita Shergill, by far one of the most known women Indian artists dealt with the subject of women with a heightened sensitivity. This was not the temptress or the subservient weak woman but one who was struggling to live within the parameters of a male dominated society, hesitant, uncertain yet proud. Women artists seem to have harboured this theme in their works, probably stemming from their own understanding of the travails of women striving to break out of the yoke of domesticity and explore their options in the new world. Anjolie Ela Menon, Lalitha Lajmi are some of the women artists who portrayed life as they saw it with women as the main protagonists. B. Prabha highlighted the hidden strengths of village and tribal women. The male artists tended to still maintain a tunnel vision of women, while M F Husain saw them as a reserve of power and strength, Jehangir Sabavalla portrayed them as mute spectators, their silent and veiled forms interacting in a private world men were not privy to, Akbar Padamsee’s nudes tend to be voyeuristic. 
<br />Today’s contemporary artists too play out the power struggles between men and women. Aniket Khupse prefers to show how the sexes relate on an equal platform as they act out relationships in his canvases. Artists like Chintan Upadhyay choose to highlight women’s issues like female infanticide through their art. 
<br />A study of Indian art is in fact a study of the changing image of Indian femininity!

<br /><br />This July issue presents the innovative ways in which galleries are struggling to stay afloat even post recession and playing the Survival Game. Our Artist in Focus is a young and passionate self taught artist, Pallavi Barooah. This issue highlights the Art Basel and Venice Biennale in its Snippets section while paying homage to M F Husain. In fact our choice of Art Extract – the line is also based on Husain’s genius use of this basic element of art. As always we welcome your feedback and suggestions. 
<br /><br />The Survival Game
<br /><br />One hears the financial experts and ‘pundits’ hail the end of the recession, the recovery of global markets and the upturn of economies following the return of consumerism. All very well, but the art markets are still feeling the pinch when it comes to sales and are more or less struggling to attract the attention of a decidedly smaller client pool. While the big auction houses keep totting up record sales, the smaller galleries are locked in a survival game. 
<br /><br />So how does this work? When you aren’t getting big ticket clients who are willing to spend upwards of a few lakhs, how do you compensate for the margins that will keep you in business? Galleries are becoming quite creative in their attempts to keep themselves out of the red. 
<br /><br />One of the first steps galleries seem to have taken is to organise workshops. These actually require very little effort in organising; the time allocated for the workshop could be a few hours and extend to a week. The workshops are usually art related, for instance Jamaat art gallery had conducted one on Gond art, a tribal artform in India. Similarly galleries conduct workshops on the art of enamel on copper and silver, Warli art... Though, some galleries tend to get innovative with their workshops sometimes getting sidetracked from the art theme completely. Take the Red Earth gallery in Delhi for instance, they have workshops on the multiple uses of the ‘genda phool’ (marigold flower) and also organise walks into the Delhi flower market. 
<br /><br />Others have decided to make use of their space for displaying products while calling them art. This could be anything from embroidered sarees to jewellery. Arguably, these products also have an element of creativity and thus a gallery could justify the use of its space thus. The only downside of this is that very soon, the gallery space would become a rental unit for almost any product. In fact, many of the erstwhile ‘galleries’ of the ‘80s in Mumbai succumbed to the recession that hit the economy then and have become rent by the week display areas. They do still retain the tag of ‘gallery’, but are everything but!
<br /><br />The recession has done away with galleries holding ‘concept shows’ of artworks and installations that are essentially unsalable. Now it’s all about the money and showing art that is eminently saleable. Controversial artists are also put on the backburner and works that have a more global appeal and decorative seem to find more takers. 
<br /><br />Galleries do resort to cost-cutting measures to keep their margins healthy. So ever since the recession hit and even when it has slowly withdrawn, one has seen fewer opulent previews of art. When preview evenings are held, the omnipresent wine and cheese have been replaced by soda and basic snacks. 
<br /><br />Of course the patrons of art do attend previews for a first look at the art, but the quality of refreshments being served has normally been equated with the standing of the gallery and now most galleries are cutting back on these. Art exhibitions are also running longer, which also helps the gallery to minimise costs on planning a new exhibition every week or fortnight. Simple other matters like not using all the lights during the day unless there are visitors in the gallery etc, reflect on how much the recession has hit the art scene. Moving to smaller space to cut down on rent also works for some galleries which do not own their own space, others simply do away with space in the real world and move on-line!
<br /><br />Some galleries, especially in New York, have resorted to tie-ups to continue to be in business and reduce the overhead costs. This sharing of resources and man-power works well in the short run, with each going their separate way when the economy picks up. 
<br /><br />To ensure a regular clientele and pick up on the small sales, galleries are now advertising their collections of ‘affordable art’. Here one can find artworks that fit a particular budget and appeal to those who are just starting out with their art collections. Primarily the works of ‘emerging artists’ would fit into this category. 
<br /><br />However, there has also been a trend of late for galleries to curate shows of ‘small format works’ which make even the artworks of established artists more ‘affordable’.Thus one could find exhibitions of artworks that are just a foot in size or even the smaller postcard size. Till date, the art has not yet shrunk to ‘stamp size’ to make the ‘affordable’ tag! Also, when it comes to affordable – nothing can beat prints! These are ideal money-makers for a gallery – perfect for a first time buyer or for someone who can’t afford the real deal but appreciated good art. The margins on prints are quite good and in some cases higher than the original work and moreover, they can even be printed to demand rather than stock piling them.
<br /><br />Some galleries have cowed down to the economic forces and closed, others seem to be on a long sabbatical, but those that are in for the long run keep coming up with innovative measures that will tide them through these troubled times. We salute these heroes of the art world!

<br /><br />Snippets
<br /><br />Artist Ai Weiwei
<br /><br />Horse by MF Hussain
<br /><br />Artist Ai Weiwei arrested by Chinese police: Early in April 2011, another example of flagrant disregard for human rights was set in China - the artist Ai Weiwie was arrested and literally disappeared! One of the most severe crackdowns on dissidents in China is underway and along with the artist, eight people associated with his studio and his wife were also arrested. This is being described by the Chinese government as a pre-emptive measure seeing the Arab uprisings in Egypt, Oman etc. Weiwei was involved with Charter 8, a public demand for democratic reform in China. He was also very vocal against China’s human rights record. According to the Guardian, more than 23 lawyers, activists and artists have been detained on charges of incitement to subversion or creating a disturbance, and another 15 individuals including human rights lawyers are missing. 
<br />As a mark of support for his fellow artist, British Indian-born artist Anish Kapoor has dedicated his biggest-ever sculpture to Ai Weiwei. Titled Leviathan, the installation is an ominous red space made of steel and PVC sheets that fills 13,500 square meters of the Nave in the Grand Palais. It makes up this year’s Monumenta exhibition in the French capital and runs until June 23. Describing Ai’s detention as barbaric, the London-based artists said Mr. Ai’s disappearance “takes us back to a Soviet-style time when the voice of artists, of different kinds, are seen as being dangerous.” “I, as a colleague, I don’t know him personally…feel that as artists we have a communal voice and it is important that we stick together, that we have a sense of solidarity with each other,” said Mr. Kapoor in an interview with BBC Radio 4. 
<br />Despite worldwide condemnation, the Chinese government remains defiant and has filed a case of ‘economic improprieties’ against Weiwei which is still under investigation. Weiwei is probably best known for his design of the “Bird’s Nest” Olympic stadium for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. His work has been celebrated internationally and exhibited widely including such prestigious galleries as the Tate Modern.
<br /><br />The Vancouver Bienalle: The Vancouver Biennale hosts a major biannual outdoor art exhibition featuring world-class international sculptures, new media and performance art. In addition, the Vancouver Biennale produces publications, curriculum, professional symposiums and public lecture series. The objective of the Vancouver Biennale is to celebrate art in public spaces, inviting the entire community to experience the brightest new and world renown talent in contemporary art. The Vancouver Biennale (Vancouver International Sculpture Biennale/Biennale Internationale de la Sculpture de Vancouver) is a non-profit corporation and is funded primarily through the sale of art after each exhibition by PHILLIPS de Pury &amp; Company's. 100% of the profits from that sale are used to fund the next exhibition, which covers the majority of the operating budget. 
<br />This year, the sculptural installations will be sold and later uninstalled. A total of 35 works of art will be disappearing from Vancouver, and these are the ones that are marked with yellow tape with the legend ‘It’s not the same without sculpture’ wrapped around them . These will include The Blue Trees, a recent work by international artist Konstantin Dimopoulus, Sophie Ryder’s Minotaur and Hare, A-Mazing Laughter by a Chinese artist, Yue Minjun and the controversial Miss Mao Tryin to Poise Herself at the top of Lenin’s Head by the Chinese Gao Brothers. 
<br />The profits will be used to commission new sculptures. There is logic to not having public art on permanent display - ‘keeping the city’s artistic landscape dynamic prevents locals from becoming acclimatized to the works on display and taking them for granted.’
<br /><br />M F Husain – No More: M.F. Husain, by far the most famous (and in some cases infamous) Indian contemporary artist passed away on 9th June 2011, in London. He was buried as per the Muslim religious rites at the Brookwood cemetery in Surrey, on the outskirts of London. He was 96 years old. 
<br />The Indian government was represented by its High Commissioner in the U.K. Nalin Suri who said, Husain's death was “an immense loss to millions of his admirers across India, the U.K. and the world. We mourn his passing away. In his death, the world of art has lost a person of prodigious talent who had opened up new horizons for other painters.” Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Husain's death is &quot;a national loss.&quot; President Pratibha Patil said his death &quot;left a void in the world of art.&quot;
<br />Husain lived in London and Dubai after he was forced to leave India in 2006 in the face of a vicious campaign of harassment and intimidation, including death threats, by right-wing Hindutva groups, who objected to his paintings of Hindu deities. A number of legal cases, based on the charge of hurting religious sentiments, were slapped on him. Last year, the State of Qatar gave him nationality, which he accepted though he insisted that India would always remain his “home” regardless of where he lived physically.
<br /><br />Indian Pavillion at the Venice Biennale, 2011: India’s first official pavilion at the 54th Venice Biennial opened on June 4th. The historic exhibition, Everyone Agrees: It’s About to Explode…, features the work of artists Zarina Hashmi, Gigi Scaria, Praneet Soi and the Desire Machine Collective. Curator and Mumbai-based art critic Ranjeet Hoskote’s inclusion of artists whose art practice is impressively unencumbered by forces of market determinism indicates a shift from an art ethos which has until most recently been influenced by western art historical and gallery-influenced biases. Hoskote looked beyond the auction catalogs and the buzzing art — market hubs of New Delhi and Mumbai, and tapped lesser — known artists to represent India at the fair, which is more than a century old and considered by many to be the most influential art show in the world. Mr. Hoskote, who served as co-curator of the 2008 Gwangju Biennale in South Korea, said he wants to “stretch the idea of India,” and build a Venice pavilion designed around the themes of history, migration and displacement, with a transcultural approach. The goal of the India pavilion, said Mr. Hoskote, is to “critique the idea of the nation-state as something unitary or territorial.” Zarina Hashmi is a veteran printmaker, long based in New York, whose minimalist works tend to explore spatial boundaries. Kerala-born artist Gigi Scaria, now based in Delhi, poses questions about displacement and class prejudice in his installations, videos and photography. Then there’s Praneet Soi, who divides his time between Calcutta and Amsterdam and produces politically charged paintings and sculptures on war and other global issues.
<br />Mr. Hoskote has also picked talent from Assam in India’s often-neglected northeast region to represent the country in Venice. The Desire Machine Collective runs an alternative art space on a ferry and experiments with such works as a “sound map” inspired by a sacred forest. The importance of multiplicity is also reflected in the artists’ eclectic practices. Mr. Hoskote said that he was intrigued by the overall theme of the Biennale — “Illuminations” — which seeks to break down barriers between audiences for classical, traditional art and for contemporary art. This is the first time that the Indian government has accepted an invitation from Biennale organizers to erect a pavilion.
<br />As for other prominent aspects of the Biennale, American contemporary artist Christian Marclay was declared the best artist in a competitive segment on the first day for his montage, ‘The Clock’, 24-hour clips from movies and television that depict particular minutes in a day.
<br />The main exhibition of the Biennale, “ILLUMination” featuring 82 international artists, is themed on the play of light in art. It has been curated by Bice Curiger, director of the 54th Venice Biennale. The Biennale is bigger this year with 89 countries, 12 more than in 2009.
<br /><br />Art Basel 2011: The month of June was also witness to another major event on the art calendar – the Art Basel. This year, around 1,000 galleries applied to show at Basel but only around 300 galleries made the cut. The works by more than 2,500 artists are estimated at a combined total worth of around a billion pounds.. The galleries showing span 35 countries, the top three being the United States, Germany and Switzerland. According to Marc Spiegler, codirector of Art Basel, “there’s an ever-expanding group of collectors, museums and galleries coming from countries that weren’t even on the radar ten years ago.” While last summer Asian and Middle Eastern collectors made a strong showing at Basel, this year Spiegler expects to see the rapidly expanding group of collectors in Latin America — not just in Brazil and Mexico — to make a strong appearance, too. “Young European collectors have also become increasingly active,” he adds.
<br />Some of the most anticipated artists showing this year included conceptual artist John Baldessari, who celebrated his 80th birthday during the show, and a more recent art world darling, 27-year old Jacob Kassay, who last November sold a painting for $86,500 — ten times its estimate.
<br />The fair opened with a VIP preview of Art Unlimited featuring 62 curated large-scale projects that include massive sculptures, video and live performances especially designed for the show. Nari Ward, a Jamaican sculptor, presented an 18-foot tall sculpture called CarouSoul —basically a cross between a carousel and a tire string with lots of shoe tips.
<br />“The fantastic thing about Art Basel is there are so many galleries representing so many movements and all at the highest quality from all over the world. On the one hand that might be a little bit daunting, on the other hand if we such a strong collection and such a long history, someone who’s coming in there can assume that what they’re seeing is of the highest quality possible, ” said Spiegler. The Indian presence at the Art Basel was in the form of : Sudarshan Shetty’s carved wood and steel sculpture - For All That We Lose, 2011.

<br /><br />Artist in Focus – Pallavi Barooah 
<br /><br />Pallavi Barooah – A name new to the art scene, but one that deserves to be the artist in focus due to the passion that she has for art. Essentially a self-taught artist, Pallavi gave up a stable career to pursue her passion. Her skills have been recognised by way of awards from some of the art competitions she has participated in. Fresh from her two solo shows in Mumbai, the artist shares her experiences in the art world . 
<br /><br />In India, art is a compulsory subject in school; do you think you felt an affinity towards art from your school days?
<br /><br />I felt an affinity towards art since I was 4 years old. That was when my father taught me to paint. It started at home but stayed on throughout school and in my 10th board exams I secured the highest marks in All Assam in Fine Art.
<br /><br />Does art, even in its related fields of music, theatre, dance etc, feature prominently in your family?
<br /><br />My great grandfather, Benudhar Rajkhowa, was a renowned poet, writer and theatre actor of Assam and he contributed a lot to Assamase and English literature both in Assam and Kolkatta. A lot of people in my family are creatively talented although none took any of their passions as a profession but they appreciate what I do.
<br /><br />From working with a travel agency to giving it all up to pursue art...what prompted the transition?
<br /><br />What made me take up a regular job was the mind set of everyone around me taking up regular salaried jobs with monetary security. My mindset was moulded like everyone else’s. The result was a 3 year constant struggle to keep my visual imaginations at bay and keep my distractions to paint at bay. Instead I tried to put my mind at work- plan out travel Advertisements, pitch for Sales, send hundreds of emails up and down and send off people to exotic destinations. Finally it was a point of saturation where I could not take it anymore. I was born an artist. I told myself that I should have been painting, travelling and capturing beautiful things I see on my canvas, grow deeper with my emotions and imaginations and live my life with a passion. So one day I gave up my regular job and now I paint professionally, teach Art and I love my life.
<br /><br />Share your foray into art?
<br /><br />I think my foray into art has been a roller coaster ride with a lot of hardwork and patience which almost always pays off.
<br /><br />Essentially you would be considered a self-taught artist. Has that affected the way your art has been received by galleries, critics and art collectors? 
<br /><br />You need to know who the actual art lovers are. Be it galleries, critics or art collectors. If they are there for Art and not just solely for money or business, they will always spare time for you and guide you. You have to approach the right people, the genuine Art lovers, not the uptight ones who are only there for money. A gallery owner who is also an Art lover will make it a point to look at your work even if you donot have a degree. An art collector who is also an Art lover will look at your work instead of only eyeing the ones galleries recommend them in terms of investment. 
<br /><br />Last year I won the All India Bhikuram Jain Awards in Painting. This year I had 2 successful Solo Shows in Jehangir Art Gallery and Artists Centre.
<br />I also sold paintings to people who loved my work. I do not think being a self taught artist has affected my Art career in any way. Instead I take inspiration from world renowned self taught painters like M.F.Hussain, Picasso, Paul Gaugin, Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, etc. 
<br /><br />Do you think having the credentials of a prestigious school like JJ or Baroda would have opened more doors in the art world?
<br /><br />I do have a Certificate in Painting from J.J.School of Art where I studied painting under professor and Artist Patil Rajendra. So I am not completely self taught.I am more like the artists of 15th-16th century who learnt Art under other artists at a time when there were no formal Art Schools. I do not have a BFA degree but like I said, if your work is good, degree will not matter much if the people promoting you are actual art lovers. But yes, studying in prestigious art schools would have opened more doors in terms of the wide network I would have had .Initially I had to run around a lot, taking advises from people here and there. But gradually, I am building my own network and have made a lot of friends in the art circle. 
<br /><br />Do you experiment with a lot of mediums and styles? 
<br /><br />My favourite is Acrylic on canvas as it is the most versatile medium. But yes, I love experimenting with different mediums.
<br /><br />Do you think you have evolved to the level where you know that you have discovered the style you will create in for the next decade or more?
<br /><br />I think if M.F Hussain would have lived for another 50 years, his style would have further evolved. Art is a continuous learning process because you are constantly creating something new that has never been created before. Artists experiment initially but gradually over a period of time, they follow one style. But as time passes you see slight changes in those styles as well. It has happened with so many world renowned artists as well. I have discovered my style but I know there will be a little change as I evolve with Art. However, I have discovered my color palette, my brush strokes and my forms which I would like to create in every canvas.
<br /><br />Do you let others comments and perceptions of your work, or even the kind of work that people prefer to buy, influence your creativity?
<br /><br />My creations are very honest. That is the feedback I got from my shows and I am glad I got that feedback because people could read my feelings by looking at my paintings. I do appreciate criticisms and feedbacks from people but when it comes to my canvas I create what my heart wants to create and not what will sell.
<br /><br />Your paintings have a sense of rhythm and fluidity to them – where does that come from?
<br /><br />All of that comes from my experience in life, the ups and downs, and the way I connect emotionally and spiritually to everything around me.
<br /><br />You have had solo and group shows in Mumbai, Delhi and Assam – do you feel each city has had a different response to your art?
<br /><br />Artlovers, be it from any part of the world, will all behave the same way. If they love Art, they will appreciate your work and will connect with the Art. The only difference is that the number of people walking into Art galleries is more in bigger cities as people are more aware of Art.
<br /><br />You have also taught art – share your experience with our readers. 
<br /><br />I teach Art at The Art Loft, Bandra. I teach teenagers, people my age and older. I sometimes have a 14year old and also an old grandmother with arthritis sitting in the same class. And what is common amongst all of us is that we are all art lovers and we have not gathered together to get fancy degrees or outdo each other. We are all there to learn from each other, let go of our inhibitions to paint and bring out the artist within ourselves. I have been lucky to get amazing students who enjoy the whole process of creating and I enjoy teaching them as much as they enjoy learning.
<br /><br />What do you plan to do next in your artistic career?
<br /><br />An artist’s career is very vague. It needs a lot of patience. There are no set of things to do after which you are guaranteed a promotion like in the corporate sectors. The career is as abstract as the painting themselves. You have emerging artists and upcoming artists, established artists, senior eminent artists, etc. But each artist within these categories have followed different routes to reach that stage. What I plan to do is evolve with my art. Keep painting and come up with honest original works and bring it in front of the public whenever I am ready and whenever I get good opportunities. And I plan to keep teaching Art.
<br /><br />Every artist is ever evolving, that is the beauty of art – that one can never say ‘this is it.’ For the true artist, the passion never wanes and art beckons at every stage in your career. Pallavi Barooah has just step foot over the threshold of the art world, but she has the drive and determination to reach the pinnacle, just like the other famous self-taught artists whose careers she draws inspiration from.

<br /><br />Interesting Exhibitions seen in the past 3 months 
<br /><br />Rare Artworks from Homi Bhabha
<br /><br />Anger at the speed of fright
<br /><br />Jitish Kallat at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum
<br /><br />A contemporary artist in a museum that primarily figures metal and ceramic knick knacks from Mumbai’s past and gives a nod to the communities that have shaped the course of the city through various dioramas and figurines, one would think that the twain could never meet. Yet, surprisingly, Jitish Kallat’s exhibition ‘Fieldnotes: tomorrow was here yesterday’ manages to merge seamlessly with the exhibits from yore. In fact, in some instances he has places his artworks so strategically that one could pass them by thinking them to be part of the museum itself. As Kallat explains, “The intention was to not enter the space with a notion of one own’s art and place in it, but see how the collection and one own’s work can be invigorated through a mutual encounter.” The museum authorities also gave him a free reign to move their exhibits around to make place for his installations. The result is that we find “Anger at the Speed of Fright”, which comprises two vitrines that have been filled with small figures armed with sticks, chains, bottles and stones, engaged in what can only be called a civil riot, which are placed next to one from the museum, filled with figures of “foreign communities” that once inhabited Bombay. There are 120 of the bamboo pieces scattered around the hall which seem like scaffolding that one would associate with the renovation of the museum carried out about three years ago, but closer inspection reveals them to be made of resin and carved with gargoyle figures. “Annexation” is another piece that could be mistaken for a museum relic – it is a giant black lead kerosene stove with hundreds of gargoyles that feature on the façade of the Victoria Terminus, carved in relief. These gargoyles seem to be in a mad scramble and are devouring each other reflecting on Mumbai’s image as a city that promotes ‘survival of the fittest’. Video and photographic installations are also a part of the exhibition which is not a static one but the artist will continue to add and move the pieces around during the course of the exhibition.
<br /><br />Multiple artists curated by Mortimer Chatterjee at The NGMA 
<br /><br />It is a rare treat indeed to witness the best of Indian art under one roof, which is exactly what this exhibition of works collected by Dr Homi Bhabha during his lifetime presents. These artworks are now part of the Collection if Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Here one stands in awe before the genius of Gaitonde, Souza, Hussain, Bendre, Sabawalla, Jamini Roy and many other luminaries who created the foundation of Indian Contemporary Art. It is almost like looking into the history of Indian art. Since Homi Bhabha was an artist himself, it is little wonder that the collection of paintings and sculptures is so artistically rich and diverse. His own views and vision for Indian art is summed up best in his own words, “We all hope that with its newly achieved freedom, India will become the leading country of Asia and one of the leaders of the world in cultural matters, and it can achieve this in the artistic sphere not by a mere repetition of its ancient forms but by the creation of new art forms, possibly through synthesis of the ancient Indian and European traditions in art.”

<br /><br />Art Extract: The Line – Its Importance in Art 
<br /><br />Art – it is almost like a science at times, with the artist at some times mixing various elements like a scientist to achieve at the desired result. Though most would disagree with this comparison, there can be no doubt that art does consist of basic elements and the ultimate creation is an amalgamation of all or some of these elements. Line, Shape, Form, Space, Texture, Value and colour are the main elements of art and for some artists – the line reigns supreme. Even the late M F Husain, undoubtedly one of the best painters from India, used the line prominently in his art. 
<br /><br />If one were to define it, Line in drawing refers to a type of mark that contains both a direction and a length. There are numerous varieties of possible lines, including curved, bent, thick wide, broken, vertical, horizontal, burred, or freehand. Lines are frequently used to delineate shapes, forms and spaces. The representation of volume, edges, movement and patterns can all be created using line. Lines can create both 2D and 3D objects and figures. Line is sometimes referred to a as &quot;a moving point.&quot; While line isn't something found in nature, it is absolutely essential as a concept to depicting objects and symbols, and defining shapes. A line is long relative to its width. It can define a space, create an outline or pattern, imply movement or texture and allude to mass or volume. 
<br /><br />Lines can express emotion, create depth or define a space, and every beginning artist should master this technique before moving on to more complex techniques. The types of lines used in art can also be classified. (reference: E-how) 
<br /><br />Contour Lines: Contour lines define the outline of an area. For instance, to draw an apple using contour lines, one would draw a clear and steady outline of that subject as well as the outline of the shadows within that subject. Expressive Lines: Expressive lines convey emotion based on their character and weight. This type of line is often found in abstract expressionist works, but expressive lines can also be used to punctuate an idea or emotion in representational works. Hatched Lines: Hatching is one method of shading with lines in which the artist draws parallel lines to express the idea of shadow. The closer together the lines are drawn, the darker the shadow will appear.
<br /><br />Cross-Hatched Lines: Cross-hatching is a similar shading technique in which a second set of parallel lines are drawn intersecting the first set. Just like the hatching, the closer the cross-hatching lines are drawn, the darker the shadow will appear.
<br /><br />Implied Line: An implied line is a line that is created by placing elements within the composition in a linear pattern. The actual line is not visible, but the idea is conveyed by the subjects within the artwork.
<br /><br />Then of course there could be a combination of the above in an artwork. 
<br /><br />Drawing with the absolute minimum of lines and yet showing the whole volume of a figure has been a challenge to artists. Artists like Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer experimented with these anatomy lines and produced beautiful figures. Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man is famous. Picasso and Matisse also excelled at line drawings.

		<document id="4e6ecae1e3baafc731c383dadb00176b" url=""><![CDATA[bMagazine Q411<br/><br/> October is the month of traditions – the festive season begins with Navratri and Dussehra and then culminates with Diwali – the festival of lights. These are auspicious days, meant for piety and tradition. So it is the perfect time to dedicate our quarterly magazine to the traditional arts of India, more specifically, the master artists who create them. As always, we welcome the views, comments and suggestions of our readers. 
<br /><br />The Other Masters
<br /><br />What makes a master artist? Is it the level of training he receives? Is it his mastery over techniques? Is it his originality? Is it the appeal and popularity of the works that he produces? One would probably say – all of the above. Which is why artists like Hussain, Raza, Gaitonde and more recently, Atul Dodiya, Riyas Komu and Subodh Gupta are considered ‘masters’ at their craft. 
<br />One wonders why this title of ‘master artist’ is always bestowed on those who are in the contemporary realm? Does the association with a particular gallery, or the number of art previews or media coverage have something to do with it? Perhaps so, as with everything else in the modern world, fame and the appreciation associated with it is closely related to being in the public eye. 
<br />There are those unsung heroes of the art world, who will perhaps never get their due. These are the artists who are tagged with the label of ‘traditional art’ and thus their work is relegated to the confines of being decorative, a quirky addition to interior decor.... something which merges with a theme. In fact, the art is categorised into categories – tribal or traditional – Warli, Madhubani, Miniature or Gond. Such generalisations have been going on for centuries, with the result that the artists do not even sign their names to their creative works. If one finds an exquisite piece of Madhubani art with an innovative and imaginative use of the traditional symbols, one would be hard pressed to trace the artist who made it. The idea of claiming their personal right to an art which is so inextricably woven into their culture is alien to them.
<br /><br />Amongst these, there are a few artists who have broken tradition and claimed recognition. As is normally the norm, it has taken appreciation from outside India’s borders to recognise the wealth of talent that blossoms in our own villages. Take the case of Jungarh Singh Shyam – the renowned Gond artist. He was perhaps the first to be recognised as a master of this particular artform. His works continue to be displayed in international museums. The collectors of traditional art continue to seek his works as a necessary addition to their collection. The artist however during his lifetime was still treated as a commodity. He had been visiting the Mithila Museum in Japan to spend a period of three months, producing art for a small monthly fee. When his passport was taken away and his work extended by another three months, the artist, who had probably been pushed to create more works, given the Japanese penchant for production, committed suicide. Today, his family continues to flourish and cultivate the Gond artform living out Jungarh Singh Shyam’s legacy. This includes his nephew – Nikki Singh Ureti, who has learnt from the master himself. 
<br /><br />Jivya Soma Mashe is another tribal artist who has found his place in the sun. He was the first to take the Warli artform off the walls of huts and onto cloth.Devising his own techniques to get cow dung and gerue (natural earth pigment) on cloth and then create a visual display with his characters and settings is what has made the master what he is today. 
<br /><br />The journey, however, was not a smooth one. Even though his talent was recognised, there were few who were willing to pay the right price for it. There were foreigners who in the past have taken is works on consignment with the promise of payment and then conveniently not sent the money. bCA Galleries who is closely associated with the artist has worked hard to promote the master artist through participating in auctions, creating the first webpage ever dedicated to the artist and regularly publishing information on the artist; even struggling to ensure that payments due to the artist were recovered. 
<br /><br />Moreover, there is wealth of talent within the Mashe family that is waiting to be explored and promoted further. Besides his sons, Balu and Sadashiv, Jivya’s grandson – Vijay Mashe - is also an artist of promise. Not only has he perfected the Warli technique and style but is also not shy of experimenting with new imagery and compositions. This is another ‘Master’ in the making. 
<br /><br />The one glaring difference between the contemporary masters and the other masters is the realisation of self worth. It is only now that they are taking on a sense of pride and accomplishment in their work and even signing it to create a distinct identity for themselves. It is only now that they are timidly asking for the right price for their work. As the country and the world recognise their talent, we are sure to see many more ‘other masters’ emerge from the blurry confines of traditional and tribal art.

<br /><br />Jahangir Sabavala dies
<br /><br />Varsha Kharatmal gets award
<br /><br />Jehangir Sabavala passes away
<br /><br />bCA Galleries joins others of the art fraternity in mourning the passing of master artist, Jehangir Sabavala on the 2nd of September 2011. A pioneer of Indian contemporary art, he was one of the founders of the Progressive Artist’s Group. Having the opportunity to study art both in India and London, gave his creations a truly international stylisation. He was a maker of visionary landscapes and believed that art does not follow life; life follows art. Jehangir connected naturally with the ghats, the sea...things he grew up with. Rocks and seagulls will always remind one of Sabavala. He always said, “discipline, dedication, steadfastness of purpose are required to reach a higher level of creativity...it is a grind but sometimes an inspirational one....You have to maintain a high graph, fight for quality in your work, you cannot do more.” He will be remembered as much as for his art as his old world charm and fashion sense. His approach to art was very different from that of contemporary M F Hussain and their passing within a few months of each other has created an irreplaceable loss in the firmament of Indian contemporary art. 
<br /><br />Recognition of Traditional Art
<br /><br />Varsha Khratmal is a contemporary artist whose fascination with the tribal customs and people has translated itself into a unique style of rendering her creations. For want of a different classification for her work, it is often called traditional. In recognition of her creativity, the Ministry of Culture, Government Of India, awarded her the 2nd Award for Traditional Tribal &amp; Folk Painting. She was also awarded a cash prize of Rs 15,000. This kind of encouragement and recognition by the government is necessary to encourage more young artists to explore the infinite horizons on Indian tribal and traditional art and bringing elements of these into the contemporary realm.
<br /><br />Frieze Art Fair 
<br /><br />Frieze Art Fair takes place every October in Regent’s Park, London. It features over 150 of the most exciting contemporary art galleries in the world. This year it will be held from the 13 October - 16 October. This is one of the few fairs to focus only on contemporary art and living artists. The fair presents a curated programme of talks, artists’ commissions and film projects, many of which are interactive or performative and encourage visitors to engage with art and artists directly. It also boasts a Sculpture Park which offers a rare opportunity to see a significant group of international work that is addressed on a public scale. This year’s Sculpture Park presents work by some of the most acclaimed international sculptors. These include new works by Thomas Houseago and Claudia Fontes, as well as pieces by Tom Friedman and Kiki Smith. Will Ryman, will show Icon (2011) the first public exhibition of one of his ‘Rose’ sculptures since they were shown on Park Avenue in New York. Johan Creten’s piece Le Banc des Amoureux (2011), is a bronze bench on which viewers can sit. For his work Ajar (2011), Gavin Turk has created a large internal door that stands open in the landscape.
<br /><br />This year’s Sculpture Park demonstrates an international reach, with representation of works from emerging artists from around the world. The Indian representation comes in the form of Neha Choksi, from Project 88 gallery in Mumbai, whose work Echo of the Inside (Column Cube I) is constructed from the sequential casting of consecutively smaller distorted cubes. Also included is a work by Gimhongsok, from Kukje Gallery/Tina Kim in Seoul; A Star (2011) is one of a series of sculptures entitled ‘Ordinary Objects’ that appropriate everyday objects, such as plastic bags, wooden sticks and Styrofoam, which are recast in precious metals. David Thorp, curator of the Sculpture Park at Frieze Art Fair commented, ‘This year’s Sculpture Park continues to provide a fascinating cross section of sculpture being made today from the monumental to the socially engaged. The works on display by established and emerging artists build on a dialogue begun in previous years, developing a debate about art in public places and the condition of sculpture as an evolving conversation that proceeds by example, as an exchange of ideas between artists and artworks.

<br /><br />Artist in Focus –Vijay Mashe 
<br /><br />Vijay Mashe : When your grandfather is a Padma Shri and a well renowned master, it is a given that comparisons will be drawn and there are some pretty big boots to fill. Vijay Mashe, the grandson of Jivya Soma Mashe, is an artist who is quickly making a name for himself in the world of Warli tribal art. We engage in a conversation with him and find out more about his journey into the world of the Warli.
<br /><br />When did you first realise your interest in Warli art?
<br /><br />Ever since childhood, I have been surrounded by Warli art. I have watched my grandfather and father creating paintings and become interested in the stories and the events they told through them. I was away in a boarding school till the tenth grade, so it was only after that, that I actually started painting myself. 
<br />Did you apprentice and learn the techniques under your grandfather or father?
<br />The training in the Warli art was given to me by my grandfather. This was in the year 2002, after he was awarded the title of Shilp Guru (master artist) by the government. He organised for the training of about 15 children, including myself and my sisters. We learnt the art from him for a year. He would never force any of us to learn, as he believes that art cannot be forced on anyone, the desire to learn must come from within.
<br /><br />How much time do you allocate to art?
<br /><br />For us, agriculture continues to be the main occupation; I have to devote time in my fields. Yet, painting is a passion, so I make sure to spend a few hours every day with my painting. Sometimes I get so involved in the painting that I lose track of time. Also, the busiest time for us in the fields is in the monsoon and winter, summers are entirely dedicated to painting. 
<br /><br />What do you show in your compositions?
<br /><br />I do take inspiration from the myths and religious stories of my people the Warli. Though, I also like to experiment with new compositions and themes. I observe the different things around me like the birds which always fly in a circle around our local temple, the trains and even airplanes that we see flying overhead. I also use my imagination at times. But no matter what new elements I introduce I always remain true to the Warli style. My grandfather also sees the work that I create, he always reminds me to keep the spirit of the Warli alive in my paintings. 
<br /><br />You seem to be in awe of your grandfather.
<br /><br />My grandfather is also my guru, my teacher. In fact, he has taught the Warli art to all of us in the family. It is thanks to him and his perseverance that the Warli art is now known throughout the world. If it had not been for him, Warli would have remained limited to our courtyards. What I find even more amazing about him, is that despite being an illiterate person, he has achieved so much, even getting the Padma Shri. His achievements reflect on us as well and we are very proud to be a part of his family. 
<br /><br />What would you like to do to further the reach and knowledge about Warli?
<br /><br />I myself take part in workshops whenever called to spread the knowledge of the art of Warli. Recently also I was in Bhopal to attend a workshop called Ankan organised by the Indira Gandhi Manav Sanghshoday which showcased different adivasi (tribal) artforms. If someone is interested and wishes to learn the art of Warli we will be pleased to teach them. My grandfather’s dream is to start a school for the children where they can learn the Warli art. 
<br />The true test of an artist is the passion he has for his work and Vijay is one such artist who explores the realms of his imagination and creativity while remaining true to the art of his ancestors. With artists such as him to continue the art – Warli will never fail to capture the attention of art lovers around the globe.

<br /><br />Interesting Exhibitions seen in the past 3 months
<br /><br />Ganesh Haloi at Jehangir 
<br /><br />Paresh Maity at NGMA
<br /><br />Jaganath Paul at The Museum Gallery
<br /><br />There is a rare time when it is difficult to define and artist’s work as ‘serious art’ or merely ‘decorative art’ – Jaganath Paul’s work certainly blurs the lines and distinction between the two. His work is bold and in your face – it has a dominating quality about it that imposes on ones conscience. His earlier subtle colour palette, which mainly makes use of charcoal, has undergone a metamorphosis as a new vibrancy is seen in his works. His compositions too have powerful characters which strong lines that are yet fluid and introduce a sense of movement in the work. There is also a new element of intermeshing lines that tend to introduce a geometric and almost cubist style to his paintings. He has been constantly evolving as an artist and his works absorb ones attention.
<br /><br />Ganesh Haloi at Jehangir Art Gallery
<br /><br />An abstraction of landscapes calls for great imagination and skill on the part of the artist which is what one is treated to in Ganesh Haloi’s artworks. In fact, there is a tendency towards an almost mathematical precision about his works, which though the artist has never been a student of the sciences or mathematics, he does admit that, ‘one finds shapes in natures, a tree is a vertical line, this can sometimes take the shape of a cross or a diagonal, circles and pyramids are replete in nature and even though the individual aspects tend to take a vertical stance, the eye will view nature horizontally – like a landscape. Thus, while one will not find a square occurring naturally, within that square if one places all the individual shapes – circle, line, pyramid – it presents a landscape.’ There is such simple logic in his works, and it is this very simplicity that transcends into genius on his canvases. There is fluidity and rapidness in his strokes, one can almost liken it to the swift solution of equations across the canvas or the flow of lyrics that builds to a crescendo. For those which a penchant for abstract art, this is an exhibition that you should not miss.
<br /><br />Shesh Lekha by Paresh Maity at The NGMA
<br /><br />Paintings by Paresh Maity based on poems by Tagore. The exhibition is a series of 15 paintings made by Paresh Maity. The paintings have been inspired by the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, specifically, the last 15 poems he wrote before his demise. This includes the last one that he dictated before he went into surgery from which he never recovered and the one he chose to be read at his memorial service. The poems highlight the theme of life and death and have been translated from Bangali to English by Pritish Nandy. The message of the poems is that ‘death is but a new birth of the spirit into the great unknown.’
<br />In celebration of Tagore 150’th birth anniversary, these 15 watercolours by Paresh Maity capture the images conjured by these poems. The artworks are a unique amalgam of the sensibilities of the PRitish Nandy and Paresh Maity. The images pulsate with the nuances of paintings and words. A recurring image in the works is that of the sea and empty boats along the shore as though waiting for a new occupant to begin a new journey. One feels that this imagery is apt as Tagore himself believed that ‘death was not a full stop but rather a comma.’ A painting titled ‘The Great Unknown’ is a beautiful rendition of a meeting of horizons redolent in amazing blues with stars beckoning in the firmament. Aptly the works are un-peopled – an empty chair which look on as though it has just been vacated and awaits a familiar presence in Footsteps of Silence. 
<br />Gulzar, the poet, director and writer, who was present at the preview rightly commented, “I think these paintings are an amazing expression of the abstraction that was in Tagore’s work.” 
<br /><br />Wahida Ahmed at the Hirji Jehangir Art Gallery
<br /><br />One could call it a coincidence of massive proportions – the day that Wahida Ahmed’s show condemning terrorism previewed, was the same day that Mumbai was rocked by three bomb blasts – 13 July 2011. So one feels and immediate connect viewing images of past mindless acts of terror – the Twin Tower tragedy in New York, Mumbai’s Taj hotel burning and other random explosions...The artist herself has grown up with similar stresses in Assam and understands the feeling of being under siege and yet continuing on with life. Some of her works present the two sides of the ‘Islam’ coin – on the one is the beauty of Islam, in its verse, scriptures, customs, rich artistic heritage and ‘tehzeeb’ and on the other is the face of terror which has twisted the teachings of the Prophet to propagate its own agenda of hate. Woven amongst the amazing tapestry of intricate design and delicate patterns are the images of the havoc caused by the terrorists. The artist in her composition has placed these in a circular almost bubble-like format, showing that these are isolated incidents – a thing apart – from the social fabric of the community and their culture. The sensitivity of the artist comes through in the works. Kudos to Mr Sunil Chauhan of Artland Gallery who curated the show.

<br /><br />Art Extract: : What is tribal art? 
<br /><br />Tribal art is a broad term used to describe art and artefacts created by indigenous people. It is also known as ethnographic or primitive art. The content and composition of the art is usually replete with religious and ritualistic symbols and significance. Often, folk and mythological tales relevant to that particular culture are re-told in the artistic format. The societies that practice this art form seldom have a written language or script and are dependent upon oral communication. Their economies are of the subsistence level and typically agrarian. The practice of art in such societies also tends to be rooted in superstitions, paintings on the walls or carved statuettes are symbols to ward off evil or bring good fortune as well. In India, tribal art is done in various forms, regions and also materials whether metal, terracotta, murals, paintings on cloth or leaves. The more known tribal art forms are Warli, Gond, Patua, Phad etc.
<br /><br />Stop press

<br /><br />Shola Carletti is an artist who has crossed continents and made a name for herself in both; that is certainly no mean feat. Besides showcasing her works in some of the finest galleries in Mumbai, she is also finding a niche in the hitherto nascent Pune art market. We bring you some insights into the artist and her work.
<br /><br />How did your interest in art develop?
<br />My father used to paint. I was familiar with colours and brushes since childhood...
<br />And I can say both my parents were really creative, so I think it was natural for me as well to be creative. It runs in the family!
<br /><br />Who would you say are the artists who inspire you?
<br />Well, I clearly remember my school days, we were in a beautiful art school and I was always very curious... I think that Andy Wharol had a big influence, cause he was a good mix of art, design and fashion...very cutting edge!
<br /><br />What made you shift base to India?
<br />The reason why I first came to India was meditation. I read a book of Osho and decided to pay a visit to his meditation resort. It was the first of many other trips here. While coming here I also enjoyed a lot about India, its people, its colours, the “energy” here. And I slowly realized that I was spending more time here that in my own country. So, the decision to shift came smoothly and naturally...
<br /><br />Has it been difficult to establish yourself as an artist in India?
<br />I am a workaholic! This is my nature, of course I love to do what I do and people like what I do. It sounds a bit simple but this is the way I started here. A gallerist from Mumbai came to see my work at my studio in Pune and she offered me the opportunity to do a show in here beautiful gallery. I think this was the first important step. Then everything else came naturally. But, always with a lot of hard work behind the scenes...
<br /><br />Are you regarded as a foreign artist, or just an artist, what do you feel is your identity and does it make a difference in the way your art is perceived?
<br />Things are as they are. I am what I am. Full stop. My identity was moulded in all my life and living in India is a strong part of it. For sure the painting technique that I use is different, it is not “Indian or Italian”, it is part of me. And I am part of a whole.
<br /><br />How would you describe your art?
<br />Well, I can say that in spite of the fact that I am actually into abstract, every painting has a story... I can describe my art as energetic and emotional... because I use strong colours and a lot of texture... Layers...
<br /><br />Recently you have forayed into sculpture, what prompted that?
<br />It is more correct to say that recently I came back to sculpture. I used to do it in Italy. Here in India I did some sculpture in fiber glass which looks more like wall installations. The statue that I presented now at my last show is a figure; she represents my state of wonder, which is the title of the art show.
<br /><br />Have the years you have spent in India had an influence on your art?
<br />Of course! I think an artist shows his own inner world, which is effected by the place and people where he lives.
<br /><br />What has been the response to your art by collectors and critics?
<br />Honestly speaking very good! I think it takes time and hard work to be recognized as an artist but if you’re consistent in your effort the right time comes. I feel privileged to have very nice names amongst my clients.
<br /><br />Which countries do you display your art in? Do you create different series for different cultural centres?
<br />Currently I showcase my work in India and Dubai. The work is not different from country to country but I usually create a theme, an issue I like to explore and I work on it.
<br /><br />What is the difference between the art scene in India and Europe, in your opinion?
<br />I see a huge difference between Delhi, Mumbai and the rest of India. In my opinion the gap of what I see at the Art Summit in Delhi and Europe is less and less. But I still see a huge difference from what I see in Mumbai and Delhi and the rest of India... A huge difference...
<br /><br />What direction do you see your art taking in the future?
<br />In the last show I did three new paintings which are an evolution of my work. I started to use digital inside the painting. I like to explore emotion through colours and sculpture.
<br />Shola is an artist who paints from the heart and that is why her work reflects the flurry of energy and emotion that is an extension of her persona. It is no wonder then that her work appeals to so many with its distinct vibe.

A place where art lovers can convene and discuss art? A place where art is bought and sold? A place where new artists are discovered? Well, it is all that and more.
<br /><br />The art gallery has played a very important role in bringing art into the mainstream culture of society and developing the art market. Art galleries function in a market place and though they are dealing with a piece of ‘culture’ they still have a business to run. Which is why art galleries that perform their role well develop into big brands, they have a list of collectors waiting to purchase art from them and the artists they promote are considered the ‘next big thing’. 
<br /><br />Art galleries survive on their reputation and their knowledge. They have to know their product, in this case art, inside out and have to be able to predict market trends and preferences in order to get ahead of the pack. Galleries that piggyback on famous artists and collectibles alone, may get the collectors flocking to them, but seldom stand to gain the respect that recognising and nurturing an unknown artist to great heights will bring. 
<br />Which brings us to the artist and gallery relationship - Ideally a gallery should be able to identify a fledgling artist, recognise his potential and enable the artist to grow, at the same time prove to collectors and investors, that they have got into a good deal. This a gallery does by adopting many routes. The most basic of course is to organise an exhibition of the artist’s finest works, where the curator and art expert in the gallery comes into play, to recognise which works best display the artist’s strengths and his unique style. But to go beyond that the gallery has to ensure a certain amount of publicity in the media, to bring the artist into the art world radar. Organising a talk with art experts who can comment and draw comparisons between the artist’s style and that of past masters lends a certain gravity and credibility to the gallery’s claim that they have discovered a diamond in the rough. 
<br /><br />The aim of the art gallery is to ultimately market the works of the artist they represent. In order to build value in the minds of the buyers, the gallery may even arrange for the images of works to be included in art books or articles being published or at some point even loan it to a museum for a particular exhibition. Getting the artist’s work included in an auction of repute and having it sell there also increase the artist’s standing amongst art buyers. All these activities also serve to up the market value of the artist. 
<br /><br />Another avenue that more and more galleries are resorting to in increase their own brand value and the visibility to the artists they are promoting is the art fair. Now-a-days there are art fairs cropping up in almost every city with a known art centre, in India as well, after the India Art Summit in Delhi, Mumbai has also been hosting its own art festival. Of course, the real prestige is associated with the international art fairs like the Venice Biennale, Art Basel, Frieze etc, where galleries are invited to participate and showcase their artists. In fact, the reputations and careers of artists like Subodh Gupta have been made at such art fairs. 
<br /><br />The Internet and social networking media has also in a sense revolutionised the way we perceive art and the role of the gallery as well. Most galleries today have a presence on the Internet via their websites. Here they can display and exhibit the works of their artists to a wider global audience. In fact some galleries have completely removed the need for expensive real estate and gone completely digital. Social networking sites are the new tool to promote artists and online auctions are equally popular. It has also brought about, in some instances, a conflict situation, with artists launching their own websites and competing with galleries for online clients. The true worth and loyalty of the artist come into play when the artists use their websites to promote the galleries that support them as well as provide a wider inventory of art to the viewers and defer all sales to the galleries. 
<br />The Internet has also given birth to a new form of art which is created especially for viewing on this new digital canvas. Social sites and blogs have given birth to new forums and art experts. In a sense the role and the authority of the gallery has become diluted. 
<br /><br />Yet, in order to catapult themselves into the art troposphere and to get recognition and indeed the stamp of approval amongst the thousands on the internet, the artist still needs to throw his lot in with the gallery. The gallery whether in real space or online still holds a greater sense of credibility than an individual artist trying to make it on his own. The role and the responsibilities of the art gallery may have changed with the advent of the Internet, but it has not diminished in importance in the art world. There are still two sign of the art coin, the creative side which belongs to the artist and the marketing side which is best left to the galleries.

While, the art market has picked up, the Indian buyer continues to be a tad immature in his thinking and approach to art. The onus of bringing about a change in this situation falls to a certain extent on the art galleries as well, which is why in this issue we choose to highlight the role of the art gallery and the relationship between the gallery, artist and buyer. Our artist in focus, Shola Carletti, is making waves in India with her art which is truly global in its appeal.

<br /><br />Art Miami
<br /><br />Indian Art Festival
<br /><br />Art Miami
<br /><br />Art Miami began on 30th November 2011, this year, over 110 international galleries and art institutions from eighteen countries showcased the works of about 1,000 artists. Director Nick Korniloff has been presiding over the fair since 2008, and the 22nd edition of Art Miami is curated by Julia Draganovic, an independent curator and art critic, who has also organized a special video segment of the fair, ZOOM! Decoding Common Practice, in addition to the sculpture pieces that are placed throughout the pavilion. At Art Miami each year they ensure that the quality of participants and art work will be of the highest calibre, and the ambiance and design will always be different and provide an energy that is unrivalled to any other Miami fair during Art Week. The highlight this year was the Persol Art Video New Media lounge, featuring six videos including a long film from Ai Weiwei. Also, Juan Montoya designed the Mandarin Oriental VIP Lounge, and Sofia Maldinado will create a work-in-progress at Art Miami.
<br /><br />Indian Art Festival 
<br /><br />India Art Festival, an initiative of Kalavishkar, began on the 17th of November at the Nehru Centre in Mumbai. The festival incorporated stalls for exhibiting artworks as well as organised talks and lectures by eminent personalities from the art world. Paintings, sculptures, drawings, installations, photographs and editions as well as video and digital art by over 400 artists were represented by various galleries. One unusual aspect at the fair was the fact that several artists had booked stalls to display their art independently of a gallery. This is certainly not something generally witnessed at most international art fairs, and we are not certain if it sets a good precedent.

<br />As an artform pseudorealism is relatively young in its genealogy. The term first made its appearance in cinema, where fantasy, with the help of special effects, was presented in a way that made it believable and real. Similarly in the case of Pseudorealist art, the artist presents images that are far removed from reality but when they coalesce on the canvas they form a picture which can be conceived of as real...

<br />Things are as they are. I am what I am. Full stop. My identity was moulded in all my life and living in India is a strong part of it. For sure the painting technique that I use is different, it is not “Indian or Italian”, it is part of me. And I am part of a whole.
<br /><br />How would you describe your art?
<br />Well, I can say that in spite of the fact that I am actually into abstract, every painting has a story... I can describe my art as energetic and emotional... because I use strong colours and a lot of texture... Layers...
<br /><br />Recently you have forayed into sculpture, what prompted that?
<br />It is more correct to say that recently I came back to sculpture. I used to do it in Italy. Here in India I did some sculpture in fiber glass which looks more like wall installations. The statue that I presented now at my last show is a figure; she represents my state of wonder, which is the title of the art show.
<br /><br />Have the years you have spent in India had an influence on your art?
<br />Of course! I think an artist shows his own inner world, which is effected by the place and people where he lives.
<br /><br />What has been the response to your art by collectors and critics?
<br />Honestly speaking very good! I think it takes time and hard work to be recognized as an artist but if you’re consistent in your effort the right time comes. I feel privileged to have very nice names amongst my clients.
<br /><br />Which countries do you display your art in? Do you create different series for different cultural centres?
<br />Currently I showcase my work in India and Dubai. The work is not different from country to country but I usually create a theme, an issue I like to explore and I work on it.
<br /><br />What is the difference between the art scene in India and Europe, in your opinion?
<br />I see a huge difference between Delhi, Mumbai and the rest of India. In my opinion the gap of what I see at the Art Summit in Delhi and Europe is less and less. But I still see a huge difference from what I see in Mumbai and Delhi and the rest of India... A huge difference...
<br /><br />What direction do you see your art taking in the future?
<br />In the last show I did three new paintings which are an evolution of my work. I started to use digital inside the painting. I like to explore emotion through colours and sculpture.
<br />Shola is an artist who paints from the heart and that is why her work reflects the flurry of energy and emotion that is an extension of her persona. It is no wonder then that her work appeals to so many with its distinct vibe.

<br /><br />Jaganath Paul at Museum
<br /><br />Pakistani Artists at Lakeeren
<br /><br />Jaganath Paul at The Museum Gallery
<br /><br />There is a rare time when it is difficult to define and artist’s work as ‘serious art’ or merely ‘decorative art’ – Jaganath Paul’s work certainly blurs the lines and distinction between the two. His work is bold and in your face – it has a dominating quality about it that imposes on ones conscience. His earlier subtle colour palette, which mainly makes use of charcoal, has undergone a metamorphosis as a new vibrancy is seen in his works. His compositions too have powerful characters which strong lines that are yet fluid and introduce a sense of movement in the work. There is also a new element of intermeshing lines that tend to introduce a geometric and almost cubist style to his paintings. He has been constantly evolving as an artist and his works absorb ones attention.
<br /><br />Pakistani Artists at Lakeeren Art Gallery
<br /><br />An abstraction of landscapes calls for great imagination and skill on the part of the artist which is what one is treated to in Ganesh Haloi’s artworks. In fact, there is a tendency towards an almost mathematical precision about his works, which though the artist has never been a student of the sciences or mathematics, he does admit that, ‘one finds shapes in natures, a tree is a vertical line, this can sometimes take the shape of a cross or a diagonal, circles and pyramids are replete in nature and even though the individual aspects tend to take a vertical stance, the eye will view nature horizontally – like a landscape. Thus, while one will not find a square occurring naturally, within that square if one places all the individual shapes – circle, line, pyramid – it presents a landscape.’ There is such simple logic in his works, and it is this very simplicity that transcends into genius on his canvases. There is fluidity and rapidness in his strokes, one can almost liken it to the swift solution of equations across the canvas or the flow of lyrics that builds to a crescendo. For those which a penchant for abstract art, this is an exhibition that you should not miss.
<br /><br />Swapnesh Vaignankar at Priyasri Art Gallery
<br /><br />Paintings by Paresh Maity based on poems by Tagore. The exhibition is a series of 15 paintings created by Paresh Maity. The paintings have been inspired by the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, specifically, the last 15 poems he wrote before his demise. This includes the last one that he dictated before he went into surgery from which he never recovered and the one he chose to be read at his memorial service. The poems highlight the theme of life and death and have been translated from Bangali to English by Pritish Nandy. The message of the poems is that ‘death is but a new birth of the spirit into the great unknown.’
<br />In celebration of Tagore 150’th birth anniversary, these 15 watercolours by Paresh Maity capture the images conjured by these poems. The artworks are a unique amalgam of the sensibilities of the PRitish Nandy and Paresh Maity. The images pulsate with the nuances of paintings and words. A recurring image in the works is that of the sea and empty boats along the shore as though waiting for a new occupant to begin a new journey. One feels that this imagery is apt as Tagore himself believed that ‘death was not a full stop but rather a comma.’ A painting titled ‘The Great Unknown’ is a beautiful rendition of a meeting of horizons redolent in amazing blues with stars beckoning in the firmament. Aptly the works are un-peopled – an empty chair which look on as though it has just been vacated and awaits a familiar presence in Footsteps of Silence. 
<br />Gulzar, the poet, director and writer, who was present at the preview rightly commented, “I think these paintings are an amazing expression of the abstraction that was in Tagore’s work.”

<br /><br />Art Extract: : Pseudorealism
<br /><br />As an artform pseudorealism is relatively young in its genealogy. The term first made its appearance in cinema, where fantasy, with the help of special effects, was presented in a way that made it believable and real. Similarly in the case of Pseudorealist art, the artist presents images that are far removed from reality but when they coalesce on the canvas they form a picture which can be conceived of as real. It is a kind of abstraction of reality with the use of colours and forms that are not a true to life; yet can be perceived as such. 
<br /><br />Pseudorealism finds its origins in Socialist Realism and Cynical Realism, which were propaganda based, however, pseudorealism is has veered clear of this and is purely according to one of its biggest advocates in India, Indian artist Devajyoti Ray, “the objective of this form of art is exclusively academic and not praising of either market or government.” Ray himself in his figurative renderings has derived inspiration from the Kahtakali dancers whose face paint is far removed from reality, yet has a strong impact and captures the audience into finding the enactment believable.

Good news for the art world! bCA Galleries has, over the years, experienced that most art buyers, especially first time buyers, are at a loss of what is the perfect painting for them. The article in this issue deals with the aspects to look into while searching for that perfect painting for your home. Our Artist in Focus, is Abid Shaikh, a master of realism. The Snippets section covers the important art events in India and abroad. As always, we look forward to your comments and suggestions. 
<br /><br />The Quest for the Perfect Painting
<br /><br />Art, it is one of the items of home décor that can raise mixed reactions. There are those who are willing to spend a fortune on a recognized signature whether they personally care for the painting or not and for others, its aesthetics that matters. Whatever your reason for wanting to buy a painting, it should add to the décor of your home environment. So what does the quest for the perfect painting entail?
<br /><br />Colour scheme: Artists may find this offensive, but a home owner does need to consider the general colour palette in his home before zeroing in on the painting that he wants to display. Then there is a decision of whether one wants the painting to complement the colour scheme or go the other extreme with clashing colours to attract attention. 
<br /><br />Theme: The décor theme of the room in which the painting is to be displayed will also play an important role in deciding what artwork to display. For a traditional theme, one could go with a tribal or traditional artwork like Madhubani, Gond or Warli art. For a more modern or minimalist room, abstract or fusion art would work best; in such a setting the artwork would then become the centre of focus, like the works of Shola Carletti or Aniket Khupse. For a typical Indian home setting figurative artwork by contemporary artists like Ramchandra Kharatmal, Suresh Gulage or HR Das, would definitely add to the ambience. 
<br /><br />Size: Here since we are talking décor, one has to also consider the wall space that is demarcated for the painting. If it is a large wall without any other wall fixtures, then a big painting which is over five feet or even a mural would not be out of place. However, for a small niche, consider proper lighting over a small focal artwork. When it comes to displaying the painting – size does matter. Also, if you are considering buying sculpture, remember it needs to be viewed from all angles to be truly appreciated. 
<br /><br />Placement: Prior to buying a painting consider some vital points for its placement in your home. These factors will influence the longevity of the artwork, for instance, placing a painting on the peripheral walls will run the risk of exposure to humidity and temperature fluctuations; placing it in direct sunlight runs the risk of fading the colours etc. 
<br /><br />Budget: Ultimately it all boils down to how much you are willing to spend for art. This will play an important role in deciding whether you will be purchasing a reputed artist’s work, that of an emerging artist or then a print. 
<br /><br />Consider all the above points before settling on an artwork, and remember, you will have to look at it every time you are in the room, so make it’s something you enjoy viewing.

<br /><br />KalaGhoda Art Festival
<br /><br />India Art Fair
<br /><br />KalaGhoda Art Festival
<br /><br />The festival this year which is held in the heart of the Mumbai art district had a greater focus on art installations this year. As is the usual theme, most artists chose to either focus on the environment or Mumbai city for their installations. Plastic bottles used to create a huge lantern highlighted the need to reflect on the need to curb the plastic menace. Further, the issue of noise pollution was brought to the fore by an installation sponsored by Aura Art gallery. Artist Sumeet Sanjay patil paid an ode to the ubiquitous crow with his installation which showed the bird in its different avatars, from scavenger to a bird revered by Hindus. Mumbai’s famous ‘cutting chai’ (half glass of tea) was paid homage to by a group of artists who created a pyramid of the glasses used by the road side tea vendors. 
<br /><br />India Art Fair
<br /><br />In its 4th year, the India Art Fair, formerly known as the Indian Art Summit, has once again proved to be the premier art event not just for art within the Indian sub-continent but globally as well.

<br /><br />Artist in Focus – Abid Shaikh
<br /><br />How did your interest in art develop?
<br />Since childhood, I had developed an interest in art and sport. When I was in high school we had a very wonderful art teacher, Mr Bajirao Suryavanshi , when he saw my some sketches and my interest and dedication towards art, he always encouraged me and I completed my foundation course in the high school time, after my 12th grade, I joined art school. 
<br /><br />Tell us about your journey in art? Was your family supportive?
<br />Basically my father was a musician and he also worked as a engineer in a sugar factory. He created a musician group in a small town and he knows about the art field and artist life very well, also my art teacher helped in convincing my family to allow me take art as a profession, so I can say my family was really supportive. After my 12th I came to Mumbai and joined J J school of art also I lived in the hostel. During that time, I did a lot of freelancing work like mural paintings; copies of old masters etc. along with my 5th year course. After my final year I only concentrated on my painting process and experimented with different mediums and possibilities. Then I had a first solo show at Jehangir art gallery in the year 2003, which was well appreciated and most of the works were sold. Due to my hard work and experimentation I got a Harmony Emerging Artist award in year 2006, hence I think I got more lot of confidence about my work and whatever I was doing in the contemporary art field. Today, I am very happy and satisfied that painting is my only profession and I work in the contemporary art field.
<br /><br />Who would you say are the artists who inspire you?
<br />Actually I wouldn’t be able to give one single name or influence, but perhaps some western renowned artists such as Velazquez, Leonardo da Vinci, Ingres, Micheal Angelo etc.
<br /><br />How would you describe your art? 
<br />I am a product of the prestigious JJ School of Art in Mumbai. Having spent my childhood in Ahmednagar in Maharashtra and completing my artistic education in Mumbai, both cities with strong cultural, political and social currents, I have honed my artistic sensibilities to search out for, filter, comprehend and build upon on my everyday experiences into my works of art. 
<br />I attempt to create a new language that combines absolute compositional/ representational freedom and transmute everyday objects, figures and construct another pictorial reality where the real and my imagination are seamlessly interwoven. 
<br />In my paintings I use the process of faceting, which dominates the background and serves in breaking down the protagonist’s figures’ formal coherence, emphasizing their continuity and interpenetrability rather than differentiating them from each other.
<br />The source of light in my paintings is the protagonists themselves. The shallowness of the space in which the highly realistic form seems to dissolve or emerge, as the viewer would like to interpret it, contribute to the theme of my painting. Light acts as the medium for the viewer to understand the dialogue between me and my creations.
<br />In my paintings, one gets to see my creative consciousness and concept of painting as a quest, to understand the socio-political environment which has honed my sensibilities as a human being and an artist. Each of my paintings is only a link in my continuing creative process, hence there is always a juxtaposition of concepts, palette and my emotions and a very heavy contrast of the above – say fire and rain, cloth and stone, beauty and blood and so on. 
<br />It is this contrast that brings out the tension between the apparent ease and the profound calculation that define the painting, directing me to decipher and reinterpret the space and the meaning time and again. Here I am, presenting my work of contrasts to the viewers for their own interpretation.
<br /><br />What makes you choose to do this kind super realistic artwork?
<br />As an artist practicing in Mumbai since few years I have been greatly influenced by the sheer pace and survival attitudes of the city. As I mentioned earlier I came to Mumbai in 1997 from a village in Maharashtra itself to study art in JJ School of art. The institute had already moved out from the hands of abstraction and it was predominantly moving towards figurative art or it was looking at life more realistically. And the scene provided me lot of confidence to move with my skill in working with oil and I enjoy it a lot as a painter.
<br />Realizing the time which we live when painting was revolving around political issues I felt it’s so important to move with same energy as I was confident enough in dealing with it. The major concern was always to decide what to paint especially when issues are very complex….It took a long while to reach at a stage to realize what fascinates me the most in this city than what makes me a reactionary….it was the train journey that always attracted me, especially the peak hours of Mumbai local… as I was a regular person traveling by train I was intrigued by the sheer spirit of women commuters who hang out and take the risk of reaching destinations without delays… rushing back home to feed the family and rushing to offices to meet the bills by denying the fear of death.
<br />I had all kinds of motivations to make it look surreal, but I decided to make it simple and straight. These women are my motives in my work and they invoke the spirit of getting what they want at a time where reaching destinations are main risk in life. They realize the fact that this is the only mode of commute to stretch their life in fulfilling their dreams….People say that this city gets back on track against all odds but I feel it’s the struggle of life to meet the ends put them back to the same pace…In that context it’s a celebrations of their need!....what you see is also the portrait of our nation. A nation which understands its limitations. 
<br />This was my ‘Local Spine’ show and after that recently I had a show at Jehangir Art Gallery title ‘Soft Land’ on the Theme of satin material (cloths).
<br /><br />What has been the response to your art by collectors and critics?
<br />Yes I got a very good response from art collectors and art critics, I feel whenever viewers appreciate artist work it’s a big satisfaction and victory for artist, but other hand whenever senior artist, art collectors and art critics criticize our work we can polish our works and its very necessary for an artist to improve.
<br /><br />Have you ever felt pressure to create as per the market?
<br />No, firstly I always create the work only for me and I have never worked by the market and the point of view of selling the work. But I think the only influence from the buyer’s perspective would possibly be that the size of my works has definitely decreased than the previous ones.
<br /><br />How important are awards and winning art contests to an artist?
<br />When I got one of the prestigious Harmony Emerging Artist award, after that more people, buyers, art collectors recognize me as an artist and this was a really good platform in the contemporary art field. I think any award for the artist is a big achievement and important for his or her name to be recognized in the art field also. People are aware of you and your art. Awards and winning art contests is the only right way but not a destination…
<br /><br />Do you think an artist needs to be based in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore, to make his mark in this field?
<br />I think in the small cities, there is a greater need to now create awareness about the art, especially since most of the famous artists belong to the small towns. In the big cities like Mumbai there are more opportunities, in terms of art schools, good art materials, many more well known art galleries and finally the buyers and the collectors. An artist also gets updated about the current art scene in the art market. There is a large audience for an artist it should be important to reach out to as many people as possible and convey his message in their particular media in the best possible way. There is also a lot of competition as compared to a small city. This kind of art environment definitely useful for the artist to make his mark in the art field.
<br /><br />What advice would you give to aspiring artists?
<br />As a artist I would give advice to the aspiring artist, that there is no any shortcut in the art, you have to do hard work and have patience, passion and dedication towards art it will be definitely give you success. Also, always update yourself about the current art scene and what’s going in contemporary art.
<br /><br />What direction do you see your art taking in the future?
<br />In the process of my recent work, actually I want to play with different mediums such as installation, sculpture and many more experiments.

<br /><br />Interesting Exhibitions seen in the past 3 months
<br /><br />Sujata Bajaj at Gallery Art &amp; Soul
<br /><br />Mask Factor at Kamalnayan Bajaj Art Gallery
<br /><br />Sujata Bajaj at Gallery Art &amp; Soul
<br /><br />Ganapati - the elephant headed God who has charmed and fascinated many across the globe. While in the Hindu pantheon he holds a position of high regard and respect, his intrinsic charisma has enthralled creative minds at all levels. This particular suite of works by Sujata Bajaj pays homage to the special relationship that the artist has shared with Lord Ganesh through various phases of her life. Her colour palette is vibrant and eathy, capturing the essense of all that Ganesha represents - new beginnings and vitality. The artist's foray into the world of sculpture is a marvel to behold.
<br /><br />Mask Factor at Kamalnayan Bajaj Art Gallery
<br /><br />One is accustomed to seeing paintings and sculptures at art exhibitions - Mask Factor is one show that in a sense combines these two disciplines. On the one hand you have the molded masks and then you have the artists creating the painted images on them. The result is a surreal world of faces that take us through a gamut of human experiences. You have the take on the traditional mask as that of Deepak Joshi, while Kinnari Sanghvi and Hemant Sathe have ignored the topography of the face completely to create their paintings.
<br /><br />Colours 2012 at ArtLand Gallery
<br /><br />The group show Colours has become an annual feature on the Indian art scene, much as the erstwhile Harmony show used to be in earlier years. In fact, the Colours 2012, does not disappoint in terms of sheer number of artworks or the quality of art on display. Indian contemporary talent is brilliantly showcased with the works of HR Das, Abid Shaikh, Piu Sarkar, Niladri Paul and Nishant Dange among a galaxy of others. Indian Masters such as Gurcharan Singh, Satish Gujral, Manu Parekh and Lalitha Lajmi rub shoulders with the international art phenomenon - Picasso. Contemporary international artists are also represented with artists like Shola Carletti and Jeff Gillette. The Colours show is growing in strength every year and one must mention its curator Sunil Chauhan of Artland Gallery whose unfailing efforts serve to make this show a hit every year.

Very often, we may appreciate a painting without even realising the subtle subtext that the various colours are adding to it. Every artist does in fact have to learn the basics of colour theory which is essentially how to mix colours from the wide spectrum available.
<br /><br />Colours in a painting are incorporated in a certain manner to create the right effect. They serve several purposes. Primarily colours when used to highlight certain features or contrasting between bright and dull shades lead the eye through the painting, thus creating a visual path and creating an interest in the entire painting. 
<br /><br />Moreover, by use of colours, especially of the same hue or intensity, artists are able to achieve a sense of unity and harmony in an artwork. This sense of balance is especially important in a portrait or landscape. More often in contemporary art, contrasting colours are used to create a disharmony that though may be disturbing still catches the interest of the viewer. 
<br /><br />The use of colour and brushwork also creates a rhythm in the artwork, rescuing it from being a static painting and giving it a sense of movement and tempo. An artist also needs to bear in mind the psychological effect colours have on the viewer, for instance the colour black is commonly associated with grief or death and red is associated with anger.
<br />Whether an artist chooses to go monochromatic, avail of contrasts or complimentary colours, he has to bear in mind the overall effect and impact the use of his colours will have on the viewer.

<br /><br />Portrait of Indian Woman
<br /><br />As an artist who has studied at the prestigious JJ School of Art, Abid Shaikh, definitely has the technical skill to make a good painting. But to make that good painting great one needs to have a vision and strong platform to form the basis of a series and well thought out composition of works. This is something that few artists have and Abid Shaikh is one of them. He takes the images of daily life in Mumbai and presents them as characters who are role playing. One can sense the social undercurrents and personal turmoil that the individuals of his compositions are facing. Thus one finds his various themes – the typical scene of women jostling for space in a local train, the humble street vendor peddling his wares to eke out a living, the Indian woman – no matter which community she belongs to, still losing her identity in the name of family and duty. Complex issues and stories told in a simple manner which speaks a universal language.
