The slider phone--a first for RIM--brings together a touchscreen and physical keyboard into a solid, compact design. The new OS brings some much-needed and welcome additions, including a better browser, an enhanced multimedia experience, and improved user interface. Sure, in the grand scheme of things, none of this is new but at least it puts RIM back on track. On front, the Torch features a 3.2-inch half-VGA (480 x 360 at 188 pixels per inch) capacitive touchscreen. Overall, the display is clear and bright enough for reading text and viewing Web pages, photos, and video. However, compared to many of today's smartphones, such as the HTC Droid Incredible and Samsung Captivate, the difference in resolution is noticeable and Torch's screen falls a bit flat.

With the ability to switch it out for leather backs and various colors, it would have been nice to see this on the Tour. While the battery casing isn’t bad, it’s sort of awkward to look at. You can look for yourself in the pics, but it’s something about the fact that the hinge is in the middle of the case makes for an awkward release. Compared to the Bold, it’s a little easier to remove, but I still want RIM to make the battery casing experience easier in general. The Storm casing was the apogee of awkward battery case removals.BlackBerry Tour runs on the carrier's respective EV-DO Rev. A 3G networks domestically and offers 3G UMTS/HSPA 2100Mhz and quad-band support, so you can get voice and data coverage while traveling outside of North America. The smartphone also offers Bluetooth 2.0 including stereo Bluetooth and tethering as well as assisted and autonomous GPS, but unfortunately, there is no Wi-Fi.As far as design, the BlackBerry Tour is a blend of the RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 and the RIM BlackBerry Bold. The device measures 4.4 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.5 inch thick and weighs 4.5 ounces. There's a 35-key QWERTY keyboard for easy typing and a 2.44-inch, 480x360-pixel resolution display.
