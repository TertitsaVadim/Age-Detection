There are  some people who succeeded the trading market while others failed.  The perception of some high-quality  signal users that signals are complete trading system is the main  reason of their failure. An upcoming signal should  not be taken as direction to complete, but a hint. Opening a position basing on a  signal can be  safe, however closing it or fixing losses must  abide to special rules in order to do it correctly.<br /><br />I've been trading using third-party FOREX signals for 5 years  with a great success. And throughout these years I  find out a trading system that will surely put me on the winning  side.<br /><br />My trading system is based upon some  significant factors which are the FOREX  signals, money management and special rules of buying and  selling position. It’s not hard to comprehend this dea… If the probable  profit of  each transaction is at least two times more than the potential  loss and if the signals result a profitable deals of at least 51%,  then you can be sure that a  particular system is profitable.<br /><br />I use two good signal providers, and both of them give me  somewhere between 55% and 60% of winning  signals, which is a lot  more than necessary for a system to be profitable. When it comes to  money management rules, I am very  strict in applying them to  every transaction I’m dealing with, and I never dare to enter the  market if a certain deal cannot give me with profit and loss ratio  of at  least 2:1. I use  a special algorithm of handling stop losses to cut my losses down  to a minimum or zero losses.<br /><br />What makes my system extremely  profitable and reliable  is it allows me to exit half of loosing positions with a zero  profit/loss. You can  trade the way I did and  create more money to keep up with the  lifestyle that you want.<br /><br />Just enter your email address in the box and press the orange  button to get instant access to my free training where I will  explain my trading system in details.<br /><br />My web-site at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fblog%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/blog/</a>  can also offer you  more points and  data about significant techniques in winning the industry along with limiting your losses.

On stock exchange you actually trade papers that stand for organizations, and in FOREX market you likewise trade papers that represent entire nations.<br />In FOREX, trading instruments are currency pairs such as EURUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY, and so on. You do operations on FOREX like buying and selling. In FOREX trading jargon, when you are said to &quot;buy EURUSD&quot; pair, you will sell your US dollars and buy Euro at the current exchange rate as determined by your broker. When you close this position, you sell these Euros and buy US dollars back. Hopefully you will end up with more US dollars than when you started, but it will depend how the Euro will behave against the US dollar, so you will either gain some money or loose some money.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcurrencytradingforex05.wetpaint.com%2Fpage%2FWhat%2BCurrency%2BTrading%2BFOREX%2BMeans%2B%252849%2529"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://currencytradingforex05.wetpaint.com/page/What+Currency+Trading+FOREX+Means+%2849%29</a>  usually involves leveraging because prices of currencies do not change that much as stocks do.

Most common leverage is 100:1, sometimes 20:1 or 50:1. This really means that for each dollar you trade, broker adds 99, 19 or 49 respectively from his own money.

The truth is,  its impossible for FOREX  traders to forecast the price movement  even by means of technical  analysis which probability is just  around 60%. Even by means of  technical analysis, the chance for  FOREX dealers in forecasting  the price mechanism is about 60%  which is actually not  reliable. It  theoretically means that  even if you flip a coin in order to  decide whether you are buying  or selling a currency pair today,  you should still be a  profitable trader if you exit the market at  a right time, every  time. However if you  want a stable  system that will give you more than 50% chance of  winning the  trade, then you should not misunderstand me that I am  suggesting  you to enter the market by just using a coin. <br /><br />I'm just trying to highlight the fact that your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7Post%253a487656e6-881e-44e3-bbd0-83a7370ddc40%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5%3D"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a4bdf180ebac046c59e98bfa13d435de7Post%3a487656e6-881e-44e3-bbd0-83a7370ddc40&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5=</a>  actually matters more than  the  entry one. <br /><br />Maybe you just found out that you   miss the opportunity of earning more because you close your   positions either too early or too late. <br /><br />I think we better   discuss about the best solution on how to increase your profits   and reduce your losses. Theory states that   any trading system, even a loosing system can be profitable if  you  cut losses in half and multiply your profits by two, so you  better  read this post thoroughly because this topic will going to  reveal  something. <br /><br />For instance,  you have a  system that gives you a buy EURUSD signal… You   should not think twice and obtain a pair of EURUSD as soon as   possible. You can't improve anything at the entry level. By now, we will check what is really required. You can cut your losses at least   in half if you use hedging instead of fixed stop losses. Instead of setting a stop-loss order, you can set another   order in the opposite direction at the stop loss target point   (lets say sell order as our example) so that you can fix your   losses. If the movement of the market is against your   position then you will end up having 2 open positions: one is BUY and the other one is SELL.<br /><br />Hedging is an excellent  approach in  trading exit strategy. You can be more secured with this  strategy,  because it allows you to fix losses and exit the market  at the  nearest inter-session or inter-trend flat with zero loss  even  when volatility is at its peak and certainly is at the lower   part. The average of stop-loss size of a day strategy actually   corresponds to the inter-session flats for EURUSD with 30 - 40   pips on average. While the average for inter-trend flats are   frequently higher with 50 - 70 pips on average.<br /><br />Then what   about the profit… Setting   take profit orders correctly may double your profits.   Probably you  are  considering either one of the following approaches, to either  set  take profit orders to your target profit or to not set them  at  all. THAT IS NOT A GOOD DECISION!!! Setting your take profit at your profit target will end   you losing a big part of your profit once the market moves beyond   it.<br /><br />In most cases if the  market pulls back near your  profit targets, you will also lose  part of your profit if you do  not use take profit orders at all. So what I will  do now is to advise you to correctly  use your take profit  orders. Avoid  setting  your take profit to your profit target and you should  rather set  it to average daily range of the currency pair that you  are  trading (+120 pips for EURUSD currency pair). This approach is also recommended in taking   profits for your hedging orders. The implementation of these big take   profit orders usually happens when the market begins to pull back.<br /><br />I tested it many years ago, and I use such big take  profit  orders every day with a great success. In at least 30% of the cases they  trigger.<br /><br />You can choose either one of these  options when you notice  that the market flats out approaching your  profit target, either  you close your position manually or set a  trailing profit order  if you anticipate for more.<br /><br />You may noticed that,  this impressive  technique  would  really  bring you to a  fantastic good results with  trading and you can even  find out about  vital techniques  associated with it   simply by viewing my website at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blogster.com%2Fwverlinewachda%2Fthe-sure-win-strategy-in-trading"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogster.com/wverlinewachda/the-sure-win-strategy-in-trading</a> .

Some would even give you 200:1 leverage, but it is very risky for you and very few people use it.<br /><br />To trade currencies, you can use a regular trading platform such as MetaTrader. A lot of large brokers will allow you to use the same software, same platform and same broker to trade FOREX, stock market and perhaps other markets at the same time if you want it.<br /><br />Currency trading is commonly viewed as being riskier than regular stock trading, because stock is mostly dependant on the company performance, while currency is much more volatile since it depends on a huge number of factors in different countries of the world. However where there is higher risk, there is usually higher return, and high volatility will let you have bigger profits (and bigger losses of course if you are not careful).<br /><br />To trade successfully, you will need a few additional things like a good trading system, which is just a very well defined set of rules for entry and exit conditions, a good, balanced money management system and balls of steel to trade currencies. This will allow you to have a lifestyle of your choice by just being a FOREX day trader.<br /><br />You now have a good idea about currency trading FOREX, and if you require additional information on that visit my website at:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdellcheverea5.livejournal.com%2F4359.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dellcheverea5.livejournal.com/4359.html</a>

If the market's movement extended beyond what you forecasted, the first  one limits your profit.  Your profit will  still be limited with the second option, especially when the volatility of a trend is very  high. So what will happen in many cases.. Your trailing take-profit order might be set  too close to the current price when activated, and be implemented when a  slight temporary pull-back takes place. And later on,  the market increases higher and you will end up loosing a big chunk of your  predicted profit.<br /><br />I recommend you to make use of a fixed take-profit order when you are going to open a position, and set it according to the average  daily range of the currency pair you are trading which is +120 pips fir EURUSD  currency pair. There are number of  advantages you can enjoy with this approach. First of all, if a significant trend starts the  day you open your position, you have a good chance your large take  profit order will be executed.<br /><br />Now, you can  have a full advantage in succeeding the trade with  the explained  method, and you could also get out more in my website at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradingsignalsfx.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.tradingsignalsfx.com</a> , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradingsignalsfx.com%2Ftake-profit"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.tradingsignalsfx.com/take-profit</a>

Have you ever tried to test trading systems utilizing charts along with a piece of paper you understand how time-costly it can be, and how many mistakes you can make during back-testing.<br />First of all, let's discuss the  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F644534%2Fjournal%3D"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystrength.org/people/644534/journal=</a>  used for FOREX charting. There exists two types of FOREX charting software: the 1st kind uses historical FOREX data only and generally displays FOREX history; and the second kind uses history as well as live FOREX data, and displays FOREX live charts; you should have both charts, historical and live, and you also must be able to draw various visual objects on the charts including trend lines, channels, moving averages as well as other technical indicators. Additionally you must be able to add any necessary known indicators and studies to your charts. Meta Trader, Meta Stock and Trade Station are the best trading software programs that feature extensive charting. These 3 software products are definitely not the only ones available for traders, there are many great choices actually, and I've tested quite a few of them; but I did not mention other software products because I excessively used just these 3, and most of my fellow traders also utilized them with  success.<br />I work with Meta Trader most of the time, and favor it over other software products mainly because it brings together nice charting and a trading terminal in one easy-to-use bundle that comes at no cost with nearly every Fx broker. Meta Trader has outstanding charting capabilities, it offers an integrated terminal window where you execute and manage your trades, and it is supported by the majority of Fx brokers as a trading platform. You simply install it on your own computer and this is pretty much everything you need to analyze the market and do your trading.<br />Finally let's talk about a vey important aspect of your trading success - trading strategy back-testing. Many of us are filled with good ideas, but we often foolishly believe that some of our ideas could do the job; and if we try them on a real live account, we can never predict whether we are going to win or lose; that is why you need to test any ideas before using them on your live account. If you know how to use programming languages, and can turn your trading strategy into a set of straightforward rules, and next into an expert adviser, utilise Meta Trader's strategy tester to back test it. If you're making trading decisions according to advanced patterns that only your brain understands, you need to have a tool that would allow you to test your strategies in a manual manner, by showing you live charts, and allowing you to to open and close positions manually.<br />For this purpose, I use Trading Strategy Tester for FOREX. This software product offers extensive charting and enables you to manually test your strategies in a really easy way. When you start emulation, all the picked currency pairs are displayed as live charts where you may sketch your trend lines, channels, add technical indicators and studies. If you are prepared to begin testing, you can press the Run button that'll start the real-time trading simulation based upon historical FOREX data. From this point, you see how the very last candlestick is breathing, and new candlesticks appear on the computer screen. There is absolutely no distinction between the real real-time trading and the emulation of real-time trading in Trading Strategy Tester for FOREX except for the simulation is done by using historical FOREX data. You wait for a trading signal, and then open a position or place a delayed order. Then you don't need to wait for many hours or days for your position to close, you just fast-forward your chart until it closes, and the program immediately computes profit and loss .<br />Next you fast-forward to quickly reach the next place in which you would like to open your next position, open it and fast-forward once more. You are free to repeat the sequence all over again and fast-forward the chart up until you make it to the end of the testing time period or decide to stop testing by pressing the Stop button. Once you stop simulation by pushing the Stop button, you can view your trading report to find all the important parameters of your FX trading system including average profit, average loss, average profit/loss ratio, maximum drawdown etc.<br />If you need to download Trading Strategy Tester for FOREX, click the Download button below this post. So to sum up what I've just said, I give you a list of the best trading software .<br /><br />Meta Trader - excellent for live trading, and offers you perfect FOREX charts;<br />Trading Strategy Tester for FOREX - ideal for back-testing of your trading strategies and concepts.<br /><br />If you require additional information on best trading software as well as on FOREX trading in general, go to my website at:  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FProven-Best-Trading-Software-Packages%2F03EFBFFFF023A456D00080170FED7"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Proven-Best-Trading-Software-Packages/03EFBFFFF023A456D00080170FED7</a>

You still have to use similar charts and trading tools even if you trade FOREX vs. stocks. Trading both at the same time are even allowed in some trading platforms.<br />Technically, you can find no difference in trading  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fblog%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/blog/</a> . In opening and closing positions you can do them the same way withy only one exception. In various countries, stock exchanges open and close at regulate business hours whereas in FOREX market, it is open 24/7. If you trade intraday you should close all your stock positions before stock exchange closes because of this single reason.<br />The biggest difference though is in what a particular stock or a currency pair represents.  Stocks may represent single companies or baskets of companies, however in Foreign Exchange, currency pairs represent economies of entire countries. For instance, EURUSD currency pair represents the entire European economy vs. the entire US economy.<br />It means that any economic events happening in any european country or in the US will affect the price. For stocks, whatever bad news about Microsoft, will not affect Waymart. But if they compete on the same market, like Microsoft and Apple, each will be affected if something happens in any of them.<br />Ask yourself first if what you really want to achieve in trading in deciding if you want to trade FOREX vs. stocks.<br />You may go with FOREX which is extremely risky and volatile but gives you great opportunities to make a big buck and you may go safe with good quality stocks which will give you a little return.<br />You may go for quality stocks if you want to be safe. Go for FOREX if you want to have both fun and money!<br />And if you wish to figure out a lot more details when it comes to FOREX, you may pay a visit to my blog site at  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fforexvsstocks90.wikispaces.com%2FThe%2BDistinction%2BIn%2Bbetween%2BFOREX%2Band%2BStock%2BMarket"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://forexvsstocks90.wikispaces.com/The+Distinction+In+between+FOREX+and+Stock+Market</a>
