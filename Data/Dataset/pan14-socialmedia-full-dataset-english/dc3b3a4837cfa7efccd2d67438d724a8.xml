It has been a year when family issues, medical issues and work issues have overwhelmed the literature, radio and friendship aspects of the past 365 days.
<br /><br />From the very start of the year leading up to my major back surgery until today when my youngest son was back in hospital, there has hardly been a day go by when one of the family was not sick or at the dentist, doctors, doing physiotherapist or at the chiropractor.
<br /><br />So let's forget about that part, let’s look at the good aspects of 2009.
<br /><br />What has 107, 101, 2 and 24 to do with 2009?
<br /><br />&quot;107&quot; that is the total reviews my book &quot;Across the Pond&quot; has received at Amazon since it first came out. I am so totally overwhelmed with the words of support, encouragement and the fact that so many people have enjoyed the book. As many writer guest on my radio show have stated, receiving reviews or an email knowing that a reader has enjoyed your work, makes it all worthwhile!
<br /><br />“101” is the total number of “A Book and a Chat” radio shows I have presented this year. I have had so much fun doing the shows, learnt much and made some great friends. Over the year I’ve had guests from central Europe, Australia and England as well as Canada and the US. I’ve had calls from guests parked on the side of roads, half way up hillsides, in restaurants and in the middle of forests. I can honestly say through all the time, I have enjoyed myself and from the feedback and the requests for return visits so have the people so have my guests.
<br /><br />“2” is the number of top ten books for 2009 that “Across the Pond” has appeared on during December, I am so shocked. As anybody knows who has listened to me chatting on the radio either as a host or a guest, I don’t class myself as a writer, I am know literary genius, just a humble story teller.
<br /><br />Locations of top ten mentions:

<br /><br />“24” is a number I’m not quite so proud of. It the meager number of chapters I have managed to write for the follow up to “Across the Pond” a book called “Across the Pond and Back Again”. This would be even less if it was not for the support, encouragement and almost bullying (I need it) I have received from a couple of readers whom I am now proud to call friends. Finally though I seem to be getting back into the stride of things and home to get the book written over the next few months.
<br /><br />My final blog of 2009 tomorrow I’ll be sharing with you all an event I will be running through January, that is my YA RADIO MONTH.
<br /><br />So check out tomorrows blog.

<br /><br />The show was full of questions either from the chat room or from people dialing in. Be it half asleep bloggers, family members, fellow writers or a neighbor Heidi had not spoken to for many years, all wanted to chat to and ask question of the fabulous author.

My guest today on a book and a chat is one such fascinating person. Author, chat show host, and survivor Lori Finnila.
<br /><br />Though the show and scratched the surface of this fascinating lady, we were able to see in the items that she shared with us, what a life she had lead. From being an aspiring model and doing film work, through being abused in so many different ways, Lori has trodden a path through life that many would think only happen in films or on TV.
<br /><br />Being attacked while in hospital, which lead to her suffering a brain injury to perhaps hearing about the plot to kill JFK Jn, Lori's story is one of suffering a courage.
<br /><br />In her books as well as on her own radio show &quot;Women Empowerment&quot; Lori has with her honesty and courage, been able provide help and encouragement to many dealing in items from &quot;domestic violence, and homelessness to brain injury's&quot;
<br /><br />The show is a very interesting thirty minutes that all should listen to, just to see the strength and fortitude of this fascinating lady.
<br /><br />Direct link to the show is...

My guest today on &quot;A Book and a Chat&quot; is Victor Pross professional caricaturist and illustrator, known for his &quot;extreme caricaturing&quot;, whose book &quot;Icons &amp; Idols&quot; has been recently released.
<br /><br />with over 100,000 faces estimated to have been drawn by Victor, he has an extensive experience in caricature art, comic art, editorials, game boards, character design, CD covers, print advertisements, to name but a few.
<br /><br />During the show Victor shared with us some of the origins of both his art and how he came to create his new book &quot;Icons &amp; Idols&quot;
<br /><br />Along the way some of his favorite moments have been creating a caricaturing actor Fred Ward when he appeared in Toronto for some on location shooting. Being commissioned to paint Ron Howard’s caricature portrait as a gift for the famous director. Let alone his own moments as a teacher or appearing in radio and TV.
<br /><br />In his book Victor shares some of the &quot;extreme caricaturing&quot; creations he has created, from Jack Nicholson to Einstein. A sample of these drawings can be found on Victors website, though I would suggest purchasing a copy of his book would really show you the artistic talents of Victor Pross. During the show Victor even offered to add a caricature for the person purchasing a copy of his book.
<br /><br />So why not stop by and listen to today's very entertaining forty-five minute show &quot;A Book and a Chat with Victor Pross&quot;

<br /><br />Marai gave us an incite into the book and the way it can help form the foundation of a healthy, loving, relationship.
<br /><br />Even to the eight step approach, how many of these are expressed in your partnership?
<br /><br />Two People - who love and respect themselves and each other
<br />Prioritize - your relationship. Don't let everything else come before it.
<br />Attention - Listen with kindness and empathy.
<br />Honesty - Be truthful and congruent.

Hubbard"<br/><br/>My guest on today's special one hour &quot;A Book and a Chat&quot; was author &quot;Jennifer R. Hubbard&quot; whose long awaited debut novel &quot;The Secret Year&quot; came out in January.
<br /><br />There has been much expectation amongst the YA community regarding &quot;The Secret Year&quot; and it has not disappointed, with great reviews wherever you look.
<br /><br />While the book is only 192 words in length each word is carefully picked each one aiding to what is a fantastic journey though your emotions. From the numbness that came over Colt, then the spark he felt when Kirby came along, to the pain with the realization that he may never fully get over Julia's death. It's a book that will put Jennifer up among the must reads of YA literature.
<br /><br />During the show Jennifer discussed with us how she developed as a author from writing and illustrating her own picture books at a very early age (I'd love there to be a few of those around), through successful short stories to this, her first, and by no means her last novel.
<br /><br />Sharing with us many of the stages through the creation of &quot;The Secret Year&quot; we were able to get an interesting inside to Jennifer Hubbard, the author.
<br /><br />Some enlightening questions posed by the listeners in the chat room, helped make the show one that all writers and readers and those who just enjoy listening to a good radio show will enjoy.
<br /><br />So why not listen online or down load the mp3 and enjoy A Book and a Chat with &quot;Jennifer R. Hubbard&quot;

Frank F. Fiore is a best selling author of over 50,000 copies of his non-fiction books. Now Frank has turned his talents to action-adventure novel &quot;CyberKill&quot;.
<br /><br />Frank shared with us during the show that the actual writing and editing of the book has taken around ten years as Frank has honed his writing skill to produce this &quot;must read&quot; finished article.
<br /><br />Indeed as Frank explained, some of the items which might have been a bit hard to believe as possible ten years ago, are now actually available and used in warfare and espionage.
<br /><br />Frank explained his writing process and how his transition from non-fiction writer to fiction author has taken place. How from the book being a POD (print on demand) book, has now been picked up by TrapDoor Books, where not only are they using modern networking skills, but also have the book out as free-to-play Flash Game where it has just hit 50,000 players, with an 18% click through rate. ()
<br /><br />Frank went on to let us know the three book series he is currently working on &quot;The Chronicle's of Jeremy Nash&quot; as well as the the book he stills wants to produce.

Sometimes from the information you glean about the guest that day you just know that the show will be fun, not that they all aren't its just sometimes you get that feeling that a large amount of laughter will fill the show. Today was one of those shows.
<br /><br />My special guest on today's &quot;A Book and a Chat&quot; was writer, actress, lifeguard, ballroom dance instructor and much more, Kristin Walker author of &quot;A Match Made in High School&quot;.
<br /><br />Making her creative way through short stories and picture books, this is Kristin's first published book (launched February 4th 2010), and one that has been much looked forward to my the YA readers.
<br /><br />&quot;A Match Made in High School&quot; is a story full of sweetness tempered with sarcasm, the book is the perfect teen romance. Laugh-out-loud funny, unpredictable, and fresh, one you won't want to miss.
<br /><br />The show as expected proved a great chat filled with knowledge, cometary and laughter. We learned much about Kristin and her book, even to what to do with a dirty sock. How she was obsessed with the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, or being part of Edwardian England in the vain of Mary Poppins, or &quot;Up Stairs Down Stairs&quot;. How as a Tenner and a former Deb has been one of the most rewarding things by far, providing her the opportunity to become friends with so many incredibly talented authors.

My guest today not only has brought back this Victorian language, but used it to write her debut novel, which was launched on March 2nd. My guest on today's &quot;A Book and a Chat&quot; is Amy Brecount White and her debut novel &quot;Forget-Her-Nots&quot;
<br /><br />I had been reading some great reviews around the YA blog circuit and was really glad I managed to get Amy as a guest on my show, she did not let us down, filling the show with humor, incite and education.
<br /><br />The book though pigeonholed as &quot;YA&quot; is a book for all ages, she describes a story that is &quot;Lyrical, sweet and moving&quot; to which I add educational.
<br /><br />During the show prompted by questions from the chat room we learned about Amy, and how she came to produce &quot;Forget-Her-Nots&quot;.
<br /><br />Along the way Amy shared with us some of the stories of her own life, which almost reads like a book itself, from giving her now husband a nosebleed to finding him while lost in Ireland. All of which only went to create a great sixty minute show.
<br /><br />As one blogger writes about&quot;Forget-Her-Nots&quot;...
<br /><br />&quot;Like the petals of a rose, this book has layers of loveliness.&quot;
<br /><br />So if you want to find out why you should send somebody &quot;Sweet Basil&quot; rather than normal &quot;Basil&quot;, why not to send carnations in Eastern Kentucky as well as all about Amy and her wonderful book, also what we might expect from this great new author over the next year.

		<document id="5007349e7eff3cedc859d906bbdc121e" url=""><![CDATA[A Book and a Chat with "Julia Hoban"<br/><br/>There are some guests that one has on a radio program that you just can't get enough of, that you want to chat away for hours two, or as in the case of my special guest on &quot;A Book and a Chat&quot; you ask back for second or third appearances.
<br /><br />Today I am so please to have as my guest on the show &quot;Julia Hoban&quot;, author of the fantastic novel &quot;WILLOW&quot;, which wile produced as a YA novel has been enjoyed, as Julia explains during the show by readers of all ages, not just in the America's but now all over the world.
<br /><br />As always Julia provided a fascinating incite not only to the latest news about her book, but in the art of writing, something that will be of interest and I hope help many inspiring authors.
<br /><br />Not only that, but Julia kindly set up a competition for me to run on my blog, details of which can be found towards the end of this blog..
<br /><br />Also during tonight's entertaining show, we heard about the books success around the world from already being on its second print in Spain, to being launched in Germany, China and Taiwan. The book is also being launched in the UK this month though under a different name, becoming &quot;SCARRED&quot; a name which in many ways describes the book better than Willow&quot;
<br /><br />As part of the pre-launch work in the UK Julia shared with us a wonderful article, she wrote for the The Daily Telegraph, one of the top newspapers in Britain.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Ffashion%2Fshoppingandfashion%2F7369893%2FThe-power-of-a-parasol.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/shoppingandfashion/7369893/The-power-of-a-parasol.html</a>
<br /><br />The show was littered with interesting incites and anecdotes, which was enjoyed by all those who were listening or in the chat room, and is sure to be a much followed up show.
<br /><br />HERE ARE THE CONTEST DETAILS:

<br /><br />One of the main stars of these shows which filled London theaters being the late Brian Rix.
<br /><br />The shows normally ended up with the stars trousers round his ankles, a dead female in his bed and his wife/mother/girlfriend walking in on him.
<br /><br />&quot;Getting Enough&quot; the novel of my guest on today's show &quot;Leonard Rosmarin&quot; would not be out of place with these bastions of English theater.
<br /><br />Started way back in 1982, once Leonard retired from being university professor for over forty years, he had no excuses but to finish what he started all those years before. Time though it seemed changed his views and what once was intended to make fun of his relatives, with some sex and a good story line changed into much more. The characters lead Leonard along a path where he started to feel a deep empathy towards them. As he explains... &quot;Laughing with them rather than at them.&quot;
<br /><br />Leonard has published nine books on various aspects of French literature, presented hundreds of papers at learned conferences and has written many articles. The French Government has also decorated him twice for exceptional service in the cause of French letters. He feels as though he’s been writing all his life and writes fiction to see more clearly into himself and the human condition.
<br /><br />His novel &quot;Getting Enough&quot; is hilarious as well and poignant, about a family who are desperate for emotional and spiritual fulfillment but go about seeking it the wrong way. They get short-circuited by their erotic cravings.
<br /><br />During the show we found out much about this author and his book, sharing his humor and his views.
<br /><br />So sit back and listen to show or else download it's mp3 file and listen later to &quot;A Book and a Chat with Leonard Rosmarin&quot;

Kaylin has always been into the arts, spreading her wings as director of a fine art gallery, she assisted in furthering the careers of numerous visual artists who, under her guidance, gained recognition through promotional opportunities and in national publications. While she'd been actively involved in both business and personal writing projects for many years, it was the illness and death of her beloved father to colon cancer after an intense two and a half year battle that finally pushed Kaylin to release her emotions and produce this her first and certainly not last novel &quot;Flaherty's Crossing&quot;. A lot easier to type than say as I found out during the radio show.
<br /><br />As we found out during the show, the production of the novel has not been as straight forward, as some others with the unfinished story put away in a draw for many years until with the aid of her daughter Kaylin was finally able to complete this wonderful novel. The inspiration behind the book has not been forgotten either. As Kaylin was proud to share that 100% of her proceeds from the sale of Flaherty's Crossing will be donated to the cancer research center at Portland's Providence Medical Center.
<br /><br />The show covered many aspect of both Kaylin work and life, from how she found out that Champagne Books, had offered her a contract, to the requirement for wine, chocolate and a book of tissues should be added to most authors must haves.
<br /><br />Kaylin also shared with us some of the ways she has managed to promote her book which should be available in paperback around May time, as well as the response she has receipted for the early chapters of her next book &quot;Severed Threads&quot; which looks like it could be a trilogy not to miss.
<br /><br />The show proved to be a full thirty minutes of entertainment and interest for all to enjoy.
<br />So sit back and listen to show or else download it's mp3 file and listen later to &quot;A Book and a Chat with Kaylin McFarren&quot;

Before you start thinking I'm on some form of craft kick, that is not the case. As we discovered during today's show, my guest &quot;Irene Latham&quot; debut novel &quot;Leaving Gee's Bend&quot; is about a whole lot more than just quilting.
<br /><br />Irene has been producing poetry since the age of eight, with a family that believed not only in reading and sharing what was produced by their children, but also showing them the wonders of the world in a modern form of &quot;Grand Tour&quot;.
<br /><br />Irene, resident of Birmingham, Alabama, for the past 25 years, she has published over 120 poems of various books, journals and anthologies, including a full-length collection WHAT CAME BEFORE, which was named Alabama State Poetry Society’s book of the Year and earned a 2008 Independent Publisher’s (IPPY) Award.
<br /><br />During what was a truly interesting, fun and educational sixty minutes, we were told about the story behind the book. How &quot;Leaving Gee's Bend&quot; merges the history of that location in the early thirty's, with a beautiful and meaningful story about a young girl not giving up, not letting herself down or anybody else, as well as the love of a daughter for her mother. It is a story that can make you laugh and cry on the same page.
<br /><br />There is so much information and shared during the show I do not know where to start writing about it. The best thing I can suggest is you listen to the show now or else download the mp3 file and share what was a fascinating one hour show, &quot;A Book and a Chat with Irene Latham

<br /><br />Kathi is a multi-award winning author of almost thirty books, ghost writing several others along the way. Also known as &quot;Easy Writer&quot; for her and her husband's love of riding their Harley, something which as we found out during the show, has been restricted with Kathi having five books coming out this year.

The first two books are &quot;&lt;strong&gt;NO GREATER LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; based in South Africa, and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;MORE THAN CONQUERORS&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; based in Mexico. These are to be followed by &lt;strong&gt;RED INK &lt;/strong&gt;based in China (Oct 2010) and &lt;strong&gt;PEOPLE OF THE BOOK &lt;/strong&gt;based in Saudi Arabia (Early 2011). During the show Kathi shared with us all about what lead to this series of books being developed, moving her into international fiction along the way. We went through each book and how it had evolved and what knowledge Kathi had learnd and shared along the way to producing, what I am sure will be a hugely popular series of book for this talented writer.
<br /><br />Not only is Kathi producing this set of book for 2010, she has also co-authored with Susan Wales &quot;&lt;strong&gt;VALERIA'S CROSS&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; which comes out towards later this year. 
<br /><br />That not being  enough for this lady, we learned that Kathi will be sharing some of her secrets with a writers help podcast in June.

Tonights show was one of those special events.
<br /><br />My guests tonight on &quot;&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; were &lt;strong&gt;Michelle (Galley Smith)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Trish (Hey Lady Whatcha Readin’), &lt;/strong&gt;two of the people behind a wonderful event being held in New York in May of this year.
<br /><br />These two ladies along with &lt;strong&gt;Amy (My Friend Amy), Natasha (Maw Books), Nicole (Linus’s Blanket), Pam (Mother Reader), Rebecca (The Book Lady’s Blog) &lt;/strong&gt;are the powers behind this the first annual “&lt;strong&gt;BOOK BLOGGER CONVENTION&lt;/strong&gt;”.
<br /><br />The event was first announced to the blogging community back at the start of this year, though word had already escaped that on &lt;em&gt;Friday May 28th, 2010 in New York City &lt;/em&gt;the first annual &lt;strong&gt;Book Blogger Convention &lt;/strong&gt;will commence.
<br /><br />As we heard during the show, this was just the start, as the event got more and more exposure, the numbers of those wanting to attend grow. Being recognized and officially affiliating with the BEA (Book Expo America) enabled the Book Blogger Convention will be held directly at the Jacob Javits Center alongside BEA .
<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F_t631HKKe2Dw%2FS8uqK4cfVnI%2FAAAAAAAABHQ%2FkXH_n573DVw%2Fwww.00%2Fbea2010logo.jpg%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bimg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_t631HKKe2Dw/S8uqK4cfVnI/AAAAAAAABHQ/kXH_n573DVw/www.00/bea2010logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img</a> style=&quot;float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />ointer; cursor:hand;width: 166px; height: 132px;&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F_t631HKKe2Dw%2FS8uqK4cfVnI%2FAAAAAAAABHQ%2FkXH_n573DVw%2Fs320%2Fbea2010logo.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_t631HKKe2Dw/S8uqK4cfVnI/AAAAAAAABHQ/kXH_n573DVw/s320/bea2010logo.jpg&quot</a>; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5461646077044151922&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Providing more space, contacts with authors, and being able to bundle a joint badge for both the Bea and the BBC (not the English one but the Book Blogger Convention).
<br /><br />A Michelle and Trish shared during this fascination show; the event has just grown, with some of the hardest parts being to actually choose the various panelists and moderators for the event. These will cover subjects from “Marketing” to “Professionalism and Ethics in Blogging”. As well as these panels and guests Trish and Michelle also shared with us during the show that Maureen Johnson would be the keynote speaker for this first annual Book Blogger Convention.
<br /><br />&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F_t631HKKe2Dw%2FS8uqYiost_I%2FAAAAAAAABHY%2F9rAL4ULESM8%2Fwww.00%2Fmjohnson.jpg%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3Bimg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_t631HKKe2Dw/S8uqYiost_I/AAAAAAAABHY/9rAL4ULESM8/www.00/mjohnson.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img</a> style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />ointer; cursor:hand;width: 93px; height: 140px;&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F_t631HKKe2Dw%2FS8uqYiost_I%2FAAAAAAAABHY%2F9rAL4ULESM8%2Fs320%2Fmjohnson.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_t631HKKe2Dw/S8uqYiost_I/AAAAAAAABHY/9rAL4ULESM8/s320/mjohnson.jpg&quot</a>; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5461646311707949042&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maureen Johnson is the author of books such as Suite Scarlett and 13 Little Blue Envelopes.  A frequent blogger and a regular on the social media scene Ms. Johnson will also give participants an insider’s view of the publishing industry and its relationship with digital media.
<br /><br />As well as the actual BBC, there will now also be a chance for authors, bloggers, publishers and anyone who happens to be at BEA that day to meet at the “The Book Blogger Convention Reception”. This will be on Thursday May 27th from 4-6pm at the Jacob K. Javits Center (room to be announced later). It is open to anybody who wants to attend, costing $20 for which you get snacks, networking and chance to meet cool authors and bloggers alike.
<br /><br />As we chatted through an enjoyable hour about the event, it was obvious to see that this will be one trip to New York that even I’m not going to miss. Just meeting bloggers, authors and people from the industry, being able to share the knowledge and experience across all subjects and genres, will I’m sure be a chance not to miss.
<br /><br />So check out &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fbookbloggerconvention.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fbookbloggerconvention.com%26lt%3B%2Fa%26gt%3B"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bookbloggerconvention.com&quot;&gt;http://bookbloggerconvention.com&lt;/a&gt;</a>, for all the details about this great event. 
<br /><br />If you head for Jacob Javits Center in New York on May 28th (Registration will begin at 7:30am, and the convention itself will start at 9:00am) I for one, will see you there.
<br /><br />So why not stop by and listen to &quot;&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat with Michelle and Trish - &quot;Book Blogger Convention&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; or else down load the file and listen at your conveniance.

<br />My guest on tonight’s “&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat&lt;/strong&gt;” is Author/Writer/Poet “&lt;strong&gt;Tinisha Nicole Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;”.
<br /><br />Tinisha has come a long way since at the age of eleven she started writing poetry, keeping several journals of these poems, some of which were published in books poetry collection books.
<br /><br />While poetry is still Tinisha’s first love she has produced novels and short stories across many different realms of writing from her first novel “&lt;strong&gt;Searchable Whereabouts&lt;/strong&gt;” A mystery novel about a woman is trying to unravel the mysterious death of her beloved uncle. To her latest production “&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned: Loving Yourself as a Black Woman&lt;/strong&gt;”
<br /><br />During the show Tinisha shared with us how “&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;” came about, the inspiration behind the writing and the hope she has that this book will help others.
<br /><br />A self help book, “&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/strong&gt;” addresses ten life lessons into a woman’s most intimate and professional life, while emphasizing the importance of self-love. The book touches on issues of happiness, self-love, a woman’s worth, family and more. Although the book caters mostly towards women of color, it is a book that any woman can benefit from. With powerful tips, messages, and suggestions it is, as Tinisha hopes a book that can help many.
<br /><br />During the show many area of Tinisha’s writing and work were discussed including what she is currently working on. So why not sit back and enjoy today’s “&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat with Tinisha Nicole Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;” or else download the mp3 and listen at your leisure.

<br />Swati Avasthi &lt;/strong&gt;was my guest of today's &lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the wonderful group of authors who have there debut novel in 2010. 
<br /><br />Her novel “&lt;strong&gt;Split&lt;/strong&gt;” is a powerful story, centering on a teenage victim of domestic violence, something, as we heard from Sawti, and discussed in some details she has some knowledge of. Not to her personally I might add, but from her days coordinating at a domestic violence legal clinic.
<br /><br />While there are specific incidents that inspired the story even shaped the way she conceived of the book. It also enabled her to put faces on what she felt was more like an abstract problem. Swati explained during the show, that working with such victims she’d found It was incredibly moving --- both inspiring and heartbreaking.
<br />During the show we learned how Swati had from the age of five wanted to write, and how, after the birth of her first child she’d gone back to writing currently completing her MFA at the University of Minnesota. 
<br /><br />As well as her book “&lt;strong&gt;Split&lt;/strong&gt;” in a very entertaining sixty minute show, we also heard about her work along with &lt;em&gt;Heather Bouwman &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Second Story Reading Series&lt;/em&gt;. This is a bi-monthly series giving voice to new young adult and middle grade authors, by pairing them with an established author at presentations.
<br /><br />From abuse to Hanna Montana, from emotional relationships to her new work &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Bidden&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, the show covered all areas, as Swathi Avasthi was my guest on today’s thoroughly entertaining “&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat&lt;/strong&gt;”

<br /><br />Today on &quot;&lt;strong&gt;A Book and a Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; my guest is &lt;strong&gt;Judith Graves &lt;/strong&gt;talking to us about her life and her debut novel &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Under My Skin&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.  In addition to writing YA fiction, Judith is a singer, songwriter, and makes daytime appearances as a library technician, which helps with insatiable desire for reading enabling her to devour at least two books a week… in the reading sense that is.
<br /><br />As we learned during the show her fist book in the “&lt;strong&gt;Skinned&lt;/strong&gt;” series, “&lt;strong&gt;Under My Skin&lt;/strong&gt;”, was released in March by Leap Books, where she has also collaborated with author, &lt;em&gt;Kitty Keswick&lt;/em&gt;, on the &lt;em&gt;Origins&lt;/em&gt; series.
<br /><br />During a thoroughly interesting and entertaining sixty minutes of “A Book and a Chat” Judith shared with us how her writing experiences have wound through the poetry, song, short story paths to this first book of a trilogy. Through the show we not only learned about what lead to Judith writing “&lt;strong&gt;Under My Skin&lt;/strong&gt;” but her steps along the road to publication have been helped by critic groups and now the 2K10 group of authors. 
<br /><br />We even heard how Judith along with some of these other authors will be at the BEA in New York next month.
<br /><br />“Under My Skin” when asked to be described in three words, Judith stated “Power, Temptation, Choices”.  As we heard during the show, it is a book that covers many aspects characters and indeed creatures, a novel that I’m sure will be a great hit leaving many waiting for the second and final book in the series.
<br /><br />The show was as normal full of interest and humor, covering such items such as &lt;em&gt;Ann of Green Gables fighting zombie potatoes,  how a joint critique and exercise group might help authors”, and what is it about seven minutes past nine?&lt;/em&gt;
<br /><br />So why not sit back and share a really interesting sixty minute show, or else download the mp3 file and listen to the show at your own convenience.

<br />Today on “A Book and a Chat”, I’m chatting with Jennifer Cervantes, author of middle grade novel Tortilla Sun. 
<br /><br />While Jennifer is a native of San Diego, California with Spanish/Mexican heritage her background includes a blend of German, English, French and Irish. This, as Jennifer shared with us, not only produced a wide range of food choices but also enabled her to grow up with stories with a lot of diversity. 
<br /><br />As we found out in what was a really entertaining as well as educational sixty minutes, we have to thank Jennifer’s daughter Jules for pushing her mother to open the flood gates of Jennifer’s obvious talent that has lead to this her first book, but I’m sure not her last. 
<br /><br />Tortilla Sun, as mentioned is a middle grade book, but far more than just that. It is beautiful story that's also filled with some elements of magic. The characters and the description of the life’s and locations are like an artist painting a picture, in Jennifer’s case using words rather than brush and paints. 
<br /><br />Tortilla Sun 
<br /><br />The story is about a tender, magical story about 12 year old Izzy Roybal who is sent to spend the summer in her nana’s New Mexico village where she is soon caught up in the foreign world of her own culture, from patron saints and soulful food to the curious and magical blessings Nana gives her tortillas. In Nana’s village she meets Mateo, the adventurous, treasure seeking thirteen year old boy who lives on the other side of the bolted door in Izzy’s bedroom and six year old Maggie who is raising her cat, Frida, as a dog and sees marshmallow ghosts float out windows. When the wind begins to whisper to Izzy, she is soon led on an adventure to learn about her father’s mysterious death, who she really is, and to connect the hidden pieces of her past. 
<br /><br />During the show we discussed about the issues and challenges of not only writing a novel but what happens after the novel is produced, the waiting for the final copy and then the work that starts after that. The discussion ranged across how the book and the story transcends across groups and ages, and how the characters almost write the book themselves. 
<br /><br />From ghosts to making Tortilla, from NFL to Jennifer’s next projects the sixty minute show, as always when you are enjoying chatting, just flew by. 
<br /><br />So why not sit back and lsiten to &quot;A Book and a Chat with Jennifer Cervantes&quot; or else down load the show and listen at another time.

His picture books have been honored by the Latino Book Award, the Paterson Prize for Books for Young People, the California Collection for Elementary Readers, the Tejas Star Book Award Selection and the New Mexico Book Award. He was named “Top Ten New Latino Authors to Watch (and Read)” by latinostories.com. René is a graduate of the Vermont College MFA program in Writing for Children &amp; Young Adults. 
<br /><br />René's goal as a writer is to produce good multicultural children's literature; stories where minority children are portrayed in a positive way, where they can see themselves as heroes, and where they can dream and have hopes for the future. He wants to write authentic stories of Latin American children living in the United States. 
<br /><br />From early days he has always loved writing completing his first novel at the age of fifteen, this was closely followed by five other novels before life in the form of becoming a teacher overtook his writing challange. 
<br /><br />As Rene explained during the show he soon realized that though he was teaching in a Spanish school there was a lack of books to read with the young children. So the novels that Rene had created soon came into being. This has led to many books being enjoyed as Rene shared with us by children all across the country. 
<br /><br />René Colato Laínez has come a long way from the young child that fled from El Salvador to the United States, many of whose adventures can be shared in his novels. 
<br /><br />So sit back and find out more about this fascinating and multi award winning author on &quot;A Book and a Chat with René Colato Laínez&quot;

		<document id="935c19db220bde1edb493c8e3eb36cb0" url=""><![CDATA[A Book and a Chat with Rhonda Hayter<br/><br/>I was thrilled to have on “A Book and a Chat” today another of the debut authors from the class if 2k10, that wonderful group of YA and Middle Grade authors who have their debut books coming out in 2010. 
<br /><br />Rhonda Hayter is today’s guest chatting about her debut middle grade book “The Witchy Worries of Abbie Adams” 
<br /><br />Peanut butter cup ice-cream loving Rhonda, has gone from being an actress to a mother who is writing a series of books about a young witch who keeps encountering historical figures! 
<br /><br />It has been a long “trek” to publication for Rhonda as she told us, from her early acting days to finial taking the critique hat of and letting her own creative juices flow. Even then the path to publication has been full of its own potholes. 
<br /><br />With her children the age group she was writing for characters and information were never too far away, in what I’m sure will be a book many will love reading. She even shared with us, the fact the book has now been picked up at Scholastic, which will mean it will be available in many a school library I am sure. 
<br /><br />The Witchy Worries of Abbie Adams: 
<br /><br />Abbie is a regular eleven-year old girl with normal problems, like a really strict fifth-grade teacher. (Meet Miss Linegar. Rhymes with vinegar.) She’s chronically behind in homework, struggling to remember all her lines in the drama club play, and tormented by having to keep a big secret from her very best friend. And on top of all these problems, she’s also a witch and has to deal with outsized crises, like her little brother morphing into a werewolf and trying to eat his first-grade teacher. Not to mention helping a young genius, magically transported to the 21st Century, find a way to return to his own time. 
<br /><br />In a show where all kinds of subjects were, we were also joined by Bonnie Doerr who will be my guest on next Saturdays “200” show. 
<br /><br />Rhonda proved a delightful and entertaining a guest as her book “The Witchy Worries of Abbie Adams” is to read. So sit back and listen to today’s “A Book and a Chat with Rhonda Hayter”

That is why it was a great pleasure to have on the show one of the class of 2K11 debut YA authors Geoff Herbach. 
<br /><br />While a debut in the YA area his creative juices have seen the light of day in other written and presented areas. 
<br /><br />From days spend pounding numbers into computers under artificial light at a bank, Geoff saw the light in more than one way taking and now teaching creative writing courses and producing his first novel “The Miracle Letters of T. Rimberg”. 
<br /><br />Written in the Bob Newhart one sided style of conversation, in the form of transcripts between a priest and the suicidal T. Rimberg. Who spends the course of the novel recounting his descent into self-destruction through letters and diary entries. 
<br /><br />These take him into a year-long journey from the Midwest to Europe to Green Bay Wisconsin, a trek replete with quixotic adventures in places like a Polish prison, Amsterdam's Red Light District, and the Green Bay Packers football stadium. 
<br /><br />It is bluntly lyrical, whiny and philosophical, geekily hip, and sometimes wise even in its histrionic self-absorption. It is Theodore Rimberg's voice that makes this novel sing. 
<br /><br />By the end of The Miracle Letters of T. Rimberg, it becomes all but impossible not to love T.'s all-too human frailties, his larger than life passion for small things like White Castle hamburgers and fake maple syrup, his need for love and connection. The story of his life is satisfying too, a surprising tale full of twists and turns and, without giving away the entire plot, hope. The Miracle Letters of T. Rimberg, suicidal anti-hero, is a story about hope, told in a voice that is full of the funny, sad, often rude music of life. 
<br /><br />From this start Geoff has spread his creative wings through a musical called “Don’t Crush Our Heart” as well as several radio shows including &quot;The Electric Arc Radio Show&quot;, a literary tragi-comedy done in the radio style, which aired on Minnesota Public Radio, and his new radio venture “Tales from the Poor House&quot; that will be broadcast on KMSU out of Minnesota State, Mankato (where he teaches in the English Department). 
<br /><br />Several people who read The Miracle Letters of T. Rimberg, loved the style and wanted Goeff to write a YA novel in the same voice, this developed almost overnight into his debut YA novel “Stupid Fast” 
<br /><br />About Stupid Fast: 
<br /><br />Stupid Fast is the story of Felton Reinstein, a fifteen-turning-sixteen-year-old in a rural Wisconsin town whose sudden growth spurt turns him from a small, sad, jumpy, picked-on kid to a powerful athlete. 
<br /><br />In Felton’s voice, speaking from his bedroom in the middle of the night, we learn of his broken home, his mother’s intensifying depression, his little brother’s struggles, and the seeming root of all trouble – his father’s suicide ten years earlier, against the back-drop of his growing athletic success, his first love – a young African-American pianist named Aleah, and growing relationships with the same kids who tortured him through-out his childhood. 
<br /><br />As his home crumbles, literally and figuratively, Felton finds triumph on the field born of real kindness from new friends, from the support he’s given by Aleah and her father, from his once estranged grandmother’s rescue mission, and, most importantly, from his new understanding of his father, his self, and his potential for both destruction and magnificence. Stupid Fast asks us to know ourselves, to be compassionate, and to be unremittingly passionate about what we love 
<br /><br />As one author/reviewer put it… “Stupid Fast captures the rollicking ride of growing up in a broken home with a rare mix of raw honesty and hilarity. The pages race past, powered by a memorable voice, pulling you into the strange and thrilling journey of this Dork turned Jock. In other words: Stupid Fast is Stupid Good!” 
<br /><br />And so it is…stupid good… before it is even officially released the word as spread through the blogosphere that at last there is a book that both male and female will love within the YA realm. With his follow up under way (if he does lose anymore due to computer issues) the name of Geoff Herbach is one that will be on many peoples, schools and library book shelves. 
<br /><br />So listen to an interesting and hugely entertaining show as I spend sixty minutes sharing &quot;A Book and a Chat with today Geoff Herbach&quot;
