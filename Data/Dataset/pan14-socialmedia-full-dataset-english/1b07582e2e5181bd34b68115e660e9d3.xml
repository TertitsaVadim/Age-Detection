<br />About 6 years ago
<br />in Indiana,
<br /><br />Carmen Winstead
<br /><br />was pushed
<br /><br />down a sewer opening
<br /><br />by 5 girls in her school,
<br /><br />trying to
<br /><br />embarrass
<br /><br />her
<br /><br />in front of
<br /><br />her school
<br /><br />during a fire drill.
<br /><br />When she didn't submerge
<br /><br />the police were called.
<br /><br />They went down
<br /><br />and brought up
<br /><br />17 year old
<br /><br />Carmen Winstead's
<br /><br />body,
<br /><br />her neck broken from
<br /><br />hitting the ladder,
<br /><br />and then the
<br /><br />side concrete at the bottom.
<br /><br />The girls told everyone she fell...
<br /><br />They believed them.
<br /><br />FACT:
<br /><br />2 months ago,
<br /><br />16 year old
<br /><br />David Gregory
<br /><br />read this post and
<br /><br />didn't repost it.
<br /><br />When he went to
<br /><br />take a shower
<br /><br />he heard
<br /><br />laughter
<br /><br />from his shower,
<br /><br />he started freaking out
<br /><br />and ran to his computer
<br /><br />to repost it.
<br /><br />He said goodnight
<br /><br />to his mom
<br /><br />and went to sleep.
<br /><br />5 hours later
<br /><br />his mom woke up
<br /><br />in the middle of the night
<br /><br />cause of a loud noise.
<br /><br />David was gone.
<br /><br />That morning
<br /><br />a few hours later
<br /><br />the police found him
<br /><br />in the
<br /><br />sewer,
<br /><br />his neck broken
<br /><br />and his face skin
<br /><br />peeled off.
<br /><br />Even google her name- you'll find this to be true
<br /><br />If you don't repost this saying
<br /><br />&quot;They pushed her&quot;
<br /><br />Then Carmen will get you,
<br /><br />either from a sewer, the toilet, the shower,
<br /><br />or when you go to sleep you'll wake up in the sewer,
<br /><br />in the dark, then Carmen will come and kill you

<br />This is just wrong.. 
<br /><br />you are one sick person if you dont repost this i feel for you if 
<br />this doesnt touch you because this is just wrong. read this. its disgusting 
<br /><br />Walking in my nighty; rubbing my eyes 
<br />My fathers sitting on the sofa with his friend 
<br />He pats the seat in the middle; i sit 
<br />Shivering so cold; a quilt he lends 
<br /><br />&quot;Jessy you love me don't you&quot; a smile; his 
<br />Their breathe spirts weep 
<br />&quot;Daddy you know i do; what is it?&quot; 
<br />He smiles at his friend; his hand creeps 
<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes 
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands 
<br />I try to pull his hand away; 
<br />their grip is strong! 
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned 
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers 
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again 
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me 
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men? 
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away 
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why? 
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint 
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; 
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him 
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to 
<br />I try and scamper away, but im not fast 
<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot; 
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie 
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down 
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor 
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground 
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up 
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within 
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail 
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot; 
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free 
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg 
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot; 
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg 
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh? 
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans 
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out 
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans 
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to 
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well 
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again 
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside 
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air 
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep 
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use 
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed 
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me 
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he? 
<br />If he was still here; would he care 
<br />Would he actually even; see? 
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa 
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain 
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me 
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame 
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot; 
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away 
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek 
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot; 
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me 
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door 
<br />Ever since that night; His friend 
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more 
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot; 
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face 
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend 
<br />Fade into me like disgrace 
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up 
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door 
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain 
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more 
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far 
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot 
<br />They were worried they would get caught 
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot 
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back 
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot; 
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun 
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight 
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot; 
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot; 
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last 
<br />He said I love you so much 
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat 
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot; 
<br />I was dead 
<br />After only one swing.......................... 
<br /><br />**... Please if you care for all the children and women who have been raped

<br /><br />HUSBAND WANTED!
<br /><br />1)...MUST BE IN MY AGE GROUP (70's),
<br /><br />2)...MUST NOT BEAT ME,
<br /><br />3)...MUST NOT RUN AROUND ON ME AND
<br /><br />4)...MUST STILL BE GOOD IN BED!
<br /><br />5)...ALL APPLICANTS PLEASE APPLY IN PERSON.
<br /><br />On the second day she heard the doorbell. Much to her dismay, she opened the door to see a gray-haired gentleman sitting in a wheel chair. He had no arms or legs.
<br /><br />The old woman said, &quot;You are not really asking me to consider you, are you? Just look at you....you have no legs!&quot;
<br /><br />The old man smiled, &quot;Therefore I cannot run around on you!&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You don't have any hands either!&quot;
<br /><br />Again the old man smiled &quot;Nor can I beat you!&quot;
<br /><br />She raised an eyebrow and gazed intently. &quot;Are you still good in bed?&quot;
<br /><br />With that, the old gentleman beamed a big smile and said, &quot;I rang the doorbell didn't I?&quot;
