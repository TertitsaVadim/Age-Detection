<br /><br />Hannibal Helmurto, 30, cut the inside of his throat with a 4ft blade while on stage.
<br /><br />One member of the audience fainted while watching the show by the Circus of Horrors in Croydon, South London.
<br /><br />Hannibal - a former tax inspector - was not able to eat or drink for three weeks.
<br /><br />German-born Hannibal will return to the show later this week.
<br /><br />According to the Sun, he said: &quot;It was just one of those freak moments and it certainly hasn't put me off performing.&quot;

<br /><br />Three people were hospitalised and store windows and furniture damaged in the fighting in a shop in Cologne.
<br /><br />The video game enthusiasts were desperate to take advantage of a special offer to buy the World of Warcraft game.
<br /><br />The store said supply exceeded demand and fighting broke out for real after fans realised there were not enough copies of the game to go around.

<br /><br />The 3,560ft peak has seen its snow cover fall by a third in ten years as average spring temperatures rose by about 2.5C.
<br /><br />Dr Clive Walmsley, an expert for the Countryside Council for Wales, told the Daily Mail: &quot;The changes that we've monitored are speeding up.
<br /><br />&quot;For the last two years the snow cover on Snowdon has actually been half what we'd expect in a bad year. Based on current trends there is a strong possibility that there will be no snow on Snowdon all year round.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;It doesn't mean there will never be snow, but there will not be the semi-permanent winter coverage that we would see 15 years ago. In 15 years we anticipate there will be very few snow days. The amount of snow is going to fall drastically.&quot;
<br /><br />Meanwhile, global warming could wipe out two-thirds of Alpine ski resorts over the next 30 years.
<br /><br />A study by the respected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says that for every one degree C rise in temperature, 100 resorts will vanish.
<br /><br />Scientists have predicted that average temperatures in the region will rise two degrees within 30 years.
<br /><br />Already this year, a quarter of Europe's 666 major resorts are still closed due to lack of snow, wreaking havoc on the winter sports industry in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Germany.

<br />Men love their teddies
<br /><br />More men than women take teddy bears to bed when sleeping alone, according to a new study.
<br /><br />Some 20% of men admitted to cuddling a teddy, compared to 15% of women, reports Sky News.
<br /><br />Of the 2,000 people surveyed, 63% said they needed a bedtime cuddle to sleep.
<br /><br />The study was commissioned by hotel chain Travelodge which is piloting a 'Cuddillow' - a 2ft 6ins long pillow with two 'arms'.
<br /><br />It is being tried out at hotels in Newcastle, Durham, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham.
<br /><br />Eight per cent of women said they spray their pillow or nightclothes with their partner's aftershave when away from home on their own.
<br /><br />But only 3% of men resorted to using their partner's perfume to offset loneliness.
<br /><br />Nearly three in five people felt lonely sleeping without their partner, while 16% found it difficult to get to sleep and 9% felt scared.
<br /><br />The survey revealed Angelina Jolie was the person men would most like to cuddle up with. Women opted for Johnny Depp.

<br /><br />Prof Monty Mythen is taking his two boys and two girls walking in the Himalayas in a groundbreaking research project.
<br /><br />He hopes to take Patrick, 13, Charlotte, 11, Alice, eight, and Tom, six, as far as the base camp of the world's highest mountain to monitor how they cope with the low oxygen levels at altitude.
<br /><br />They and five other children will have their blood pressure, heart rate, lung function and sleep patterns recorded in research for the Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London.
<br /><br />The results could help in treatments for premature babies, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and congenital lung problems.
<br /><br />A similar study is being carried out on adults, reports the Mirror.
<br /><br />The expedition aims to reach Namche Bazaar at 3,500 metres. The older children may continue to Everest Base Camp, 1,900 metres higher.
<br /><br />Prof Mythen, of UCL, said: &quot;It's a tremendous opportunity.&quot;

<br /><br />One-year-old Desmond gobbled down Marjorie Johnson's dentures when she was in the loo, reports the Mirror.
<br /><br />The teeth showed up on X-rays and vets had to open up his stomach in a £1,200 three-hour op.
<br /><br />Gran Marjorie, 62, of South Shields, South Tyneside, said: &quot;He's eaten them for the fun of it. He's very mischievous.
<br /><br />&quot;When I got back he was looking all sheepish.&quot;

<br /><br />Julia 'Cleopatra' Meyer, 38, from Munich, wanted slimmer thighs and instead ended up with half her bum missing.
<br /><br />The court heard that during the liposuction the plastic surgeon, not named, from a private clinic, had removed fat from her right buttock instead of her thighs.
<br /><br />She said: &quot;I had been unhappy with my saddlebags, the fat stored in the outer thigh area. Because of the local anaesthesia I did not realise what he was doing.
<br /><br />&quot;When I saw afterwards that half of my bum was missing I almost fainted. It had been completely sucked away.&quot;
<br /><br />A consultant at the Berlin Charité hospital asked for an expert opinion said it was a &quot;grave error in treatment&quot;.
<br /><br />The court heard the woman can no longer perform. She does not even dare to go to a swimming pool because she is ashamed of the way she looks.
<br /><br />The surgeon has been ordered to pay her £12,000 - twice the £6,000 she had been seeking.

<br /><br />Organisers of the Kirklees Primary Music Festival changed the traditional tale to Three Little Puppies, reports the Telegraph.
<br /><br />But local councillors have now stepped in to reverse the decision which they said was well-intentioned but wrong.
<br /><br />Children from Honley Church of England Junior School in Huddersfield are to perform Roald Dahl's version of Little Red Riding Hood, which features the pigs, at the Town Hall.
<br /><br />Festival organisers were concerned the Three Little Pigs could offend Muslim children taking part, or their parents.
<br /><br />There had been no complaints about the festival, which will feature hundreds of children from 63 schools in Kirklees in June.
<br /><br />Jim Dodds, the council's Cabinet member for children's services, said the decision to change the wording was a &quot;mistake&quot;.
<br /><br />&quot;On this particular aspect of it - everyone knows the story of the Three Little Pigs, and other nursery stories as well.
<br /><br />&quot;We have all read them to our own children and grandchildren. I am sure that no-one is offended by any wording within any of those traditional stories.
<br /><br />Gill Goodswen, one of the organisers of the festival, had said: &quot;We have to be sensitive if we want to be multi-cultural. It was felt it would be more responsible not to use the three little pigs.&quot;

<br /><br />Tadeus Konopizc, 40, from Zakopane, slashed off his penis and testicles with a six inch kitchen knife after downing more than a bottle of vodka.
<br /><br />He managed to call doctors to tell them what he had done and they sent a special helicopter rescue team to fly him to the northern town of Bialystok where surgeons specialise in sewing back severed organs.
<br /><br />But heavy fog on the way delayed the helicopter and by the time they reached the hospital doctors said it was too late to reattach the man's private parts.
<br /><br />He is now expected to undergo months of surgery as doctors attempt to re-build his penis using skin from elsewhere on his body.

<br /><br />William Elich, 46, claims he was about to enter a restaurant in Portland, Oregon, when Greg Ely, 32, came by in a Hummer with a &quot;dashboard lined with snowballs&quot;.
<br /><br />One snowball hit Mr Elich in the head, breaking his glasses and bruising his left eyeball, reports the Oregonian.
<br /><br />Mr Elich said the loss of his bifocal glasses forced him to miss work as a private investigator for eight to 10 days while he waited for a new pair.
<br /><br />Mr Ely, a stone mason, claims he has the wrong man: &quot;I didn't throw a snowball at anyone,&quot; he insisted.
<br /><br />But Mr Elich is adamant. He says that, after he was struck with the snowball, he looked through his remaining good eye and noted the number plate of the Hummer.
<br /><br />He called called police, who visited Mr Ely but didn't pursue any charges. Officers said it was one man's word against another.
<br /><br />But Mr Elich would not let the matter drop and is pursuing the case in civil court.
<br /><br />&quot;I don't need the money,&quot; he said. &quot;He needs to learn a lesson... This is a 32-year-old man acting like a 16-year-old.&quot;

<br /><br />Henry got stuck in a 10cm wide and 1.2m deep pipe at a house in Tamworth, Staffordshire, reports the BBC.
<br /><br />After the RSPCA failed to reach him, help was sought from council wardens who tied a number of hamster ladders and Curly Wurly bars together.
<br /><br />Finally, a narrow attachment on the vacuum was used to retrieve him.
<br /><br />He was unharmed apart from worn down nails - the result of trying to scrabble to safety.
<br /><br />A statement from Tamworth Borough Council said the owner's son was terrified of Henry so the wardens found him a new home and also paid the vet's bill.
<br /><br />It continued: &quot;Henry is now safe and sound and has been given a good home by the council's customer services manager who has adopted him for her son.&quot;

<br /><br />The three Begal tigers reportedly enjoy their playtime with their piglet foster brothers and sisters.
<br /><br />A spokesman for Chimelong Xiangjiang Safari Park, in Guangzhou City, said the cubs were rejected by their mother.
<br /><br />&quot;We tried many ways, including bottle feeding, but the cubs rejected them,&quot; he told Information Times.
<br /><br />&quot;Then we thought, since this is the Chinese Year of the Pig, why don't we find a pig to nurse the hungry babies.&quot;
<br /><br />The zoo bought a sow who had just given birth and brought her to the zoo with her newborn piglets.
<br /><br />&quot;The tigers are tamely sucking the milk, and the sow accepts her three new sons,&quot; added the spokesman.
<br /><br />&quot;We are feeding them meat as well now, and hopefully with the meat supplement they'll grow stronger.&quot;

<br /><br />Jessica Sansom, 10, put two of the organic eggs in an incubator the family had used to hatch geese and hens on their farm.
<br /><br />A month later she watched the yellow chicks - which she named Splish and Splosh - appear, reports the Sun.
<br /><br />Jessica, of Ilfracombe, said: &quot;I wanted to see what would happen and mum said it might work - and it did. They are the cutest ducks ever.&quot;
<br /><br />Mum Elizabeth, 53, who paid £1.95 for the half-dozen eggs at Waitrose, said: &quot;We ate four but Jessica wanted to save the last two to see what would happen.

<br /><br />Disabled Air Force veteran Randy Gurchin, 51, edged onto the ice and pulled the pup from the freezing water.
<br /><br />Then he closed Lucy's mouth, put his mouth over her nose and started breathing into her lungs and pushing on her chest.
<br /><br />After about a minute, 10-month-old Lucy began breathing shallowly, he told the Omaha World-Herald.
<br /><br />&quot;Once you get a pet, it's truly part of your family. You just tend to do whatever it takes to save their life,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />Mr Gurchin, 51, said Lucy had fallen into the lake near the family home in Sarpy County after chasing ducks and geese.
<br /><br />The wintry water paralysed the puppy, he said. She had a blue face and paws by the time he pulled her out.
<br /><br />He rushed her to the Ralston Veterinary Clinic where doctors soaked the dog in warm water, gave her several injections and put her in an oxygen tent.
<br /><br />Wife Kelley and children Kerry, 15, and Ryan, 10, were &quot;obviously, relieved&quot; that he saved Lucy, but his wife later told him he was crazy to risk his own life.
<br /><br />&quot;I didn't really have much of a response to that,&quot; he said.

<br /><br />Producers planned to give the soft foam noses to contestants' friends and family during the live shows.
<br /><br />But officials at London's historic County Hall feared the noses may be a fire risk, reports the Daily Mirror.
<br /><br />A show insider said: &quot;It's a bit ridiculous to stop adults in the audience from wearing red noses.
<br /><br />&quot;It's a shame because the show is to raise money and it might have encouraged more people to go out and buy the noses if they saw them on telly.&quot;
<br /><br />A spokeswoman for show-makers Endemol said: &quot;It is true red noses are not allowed - but neither are newspapers, bottles, bags and all manner of other items.
<br /><br />&quot;We are filming in a Grade II listed building and anything that is a potential fire risk or can cause damage when dropped is not allowed. We are working with essential equipment only.&quot;
<br /><br />The Comic Relief Does Fame Academy final - hosted by Patrick Kielty and Claudia Winkleman - is on Friday, Red Nose Day.

<br /><br />Yves Rossy, 45, a former airforce fighter pilot, gave his carbon wings their first test flight in Spain.
<br /><br />He said: &quot;It is absolutely fantastic. Total freedom in three dimensions, so much speed and power, it was better than being a bird.
<br /><br />&quot;I have to jump from a moving plane as I can't really take off from an airfield like a real plane, I couldn't run that fast&quot;, he said laughing, and added: &quot;I don't have an undercarriage either.&quot;
<br /><br />To land he has to cut the engines and coast to the ground, using a conventional parachute at the last minute.
<br /><br />Mr Rossy spent five years developing his three metre carbon fibre wings for his flying man project, then added two kerosene-powered jet engines to his original wing design.
<br /><br />Handles are fixed onto the wings so that Yves can electronically manipulate the wingtips, giving him the freedom to decide when he wanted to either glide or dive.
<br /><br />He said: &quot;After I jumped my wings opened like a bird taking wing, I then glided down to 2500m, and ignited the kerosene engines.
<br /><br />&quot;There was a short period, 30 seconds, while I waited for them to stabilize and then I began to open the throttle.
<br /><br />&quot;I soon realised I was no longer losing height, and achieved horizontal flight for more than four minutes at 100 knots (115mph).&quot;

<br /><br />Two classic car collectors from the US state of Idaho found the wallet after it fell out of the back of a vintage car they were planning to restore.
<br /><br />After an internet search they found and contacted the owner, Glenn Goodlove.
<br /><br />Mr Goodlove said he probably lost the wallet in the back seat of his 1946 Hudson car while kissing a girl when he was home on leave from the US Navy.
<br /><br />&quot;If it was in my sailor-mentality years, I might have attempted to, as they said in those years, 'make out,&quot;' Mr Goodlove told the Idaho Twin Falls Times-News.
<br /><br />Vital clues
<br /><br />Jon Beck, 61, and Chuck Merrill, 72, bought the now-vintage vehicle in Idaho after placing an ad in a local newspaper to buy a classic car in need of restoration.
<br /><br />Since 1952, the car had travelled from Washington state, where Mr Goodlove's grandfather owned it, to finish up neglected in Idaho, changing hands several times en route.
<br /><br />Driving the car home after buying it, the collectors stopped at a restaurant and saw something had dislodged below the back seat.
<br /><br />&quot;Like a couple of kids, we thought we had a goldmine,&quot; Mr Beck said.
<br /><br />Instead, they found some small change - the leather wallet held a $10 bill, Mr Goodlove's military ID, his Social Security card, his driver's licence and several jewellery receipts from 1952. But they were all in the name of Glenn Putnam.
<br /><br />After searching online, Mr Beck discovered that Mr Putnam had since changed his name to Glenn Goodlove and moved to San Diego, California.
<br /><br />He called Mr Goodlove, asking to speak to a man who used to drive a '46 Hudson.
<br /><br />&quot;There was a silence for about 15 seconds,&quot; Mr Beck told the Twin Falls Times-News. &quot;Then he said, 'Who is this?&quot;'
<br /><br />Mr Goodlove, now 75, says he did not even remember losing the wallet, but the find has brought memories of his youth in Everett, Washington, flooding back.
<br /><br />&quot;I could see the house and the car and the town and all the good stuff from living there,&quot; he said. &quot;They've been flowing ever since he talked to me.&quot;
<br /><br />Mr Beck and Mr Merrill will post the wallet back to Mr Goodlove.

The killing highlights the lure of Britain's gun culture.
<br /><br />Every mother worries about their teenage sons, but when they grow up in Manchester's Moss Side district and associate with criminals the anxiety is on a different level.
<br /><br />So it was with Bridget Austin, who last saw her son Richard alive three days before he was shot dead as he attempted to carry out a gangland hit at a pub in Salford, Greater Manchester.
<br /><br />Inside a crowd of people were watching a Manchester United match live on television.
<br /><br />Austin and Alveranga, who were both masked, approached a table at which their target, David Totton, was sitting.
<br /><br />Austin opened fire, but Alveranga's 9mm handgun jammed and the pair were disarmed by some of the pub's customers and shot with their own weapons.
<br /><br />The scene inside the Brass Handles
<br />Dozens of people were in the pub at the time of the shooting
<br /><br />The pair fled outside but collapsed on the grass, where they died of their wounds. Mr Totton, despite being shot in the face and chest, miraculously escaped serious injury.
<br /><br />Detectives investigating the events of 12 March 2006 discovered CCTV from inside the Brass Handles had disappeared.
<br /><br />The pub was later closed down on the orders of Greater Manchester Police.
