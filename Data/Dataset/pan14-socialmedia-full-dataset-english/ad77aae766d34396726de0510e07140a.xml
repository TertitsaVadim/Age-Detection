Scheduled for release in June of 2007, the Apple iPhone will be able to play music like an iPod, surf and browse the internet, take photographs, showcase videos, send text messages and emails, and, possibly, make or take a telephone call or two.<br /><br />Large deal.<br /><br />For each and every new cell phone or cell phone business that introduces itself to the market, proclaiming that their particular model of cell phone can, say, play music, there are dozens of other names and brands, some well-known, some not, that can do exactly the same factor. What's the catch? What's the hook? Where's the innovative technological design that is supposed to make the public stand up and take notice?<br /><br />Now, the Apple iPhone does have complete virtual touch-screen. There are no raised buttons to press and push, and almost everything is operated with the sense of a finger. Now, that in fact is a cool feature, but, it may not be completely practical. Why? Just simply because when I look at my hands, I see chubby fingers that are not going to be in a position to accurately press any button on a tiny touch screen. Now, unless that screen is 6&quot; across, which, if that were the case, may defeat the entire mobility purpose of the telephone.<br /><br />Why does Apple really feel the need to create and develop their personal portable phone? Could it be that they truly want to revolutionize portable communication? Do they want to make the globe a much better place? Can they offer one thing that no one particular else can?<br /><br />Appear at it this way: why does Lindsay Lohan feel she could sing?<br /><br />Due to the fact it really is one more revenue stream to be mined, that's why? Now, there's no doubt that the iPhone is cool, and will uncover a common and receptive audience. But, like Lohan's singing attempts, it doesn't actually improve the planet and the world wouldn't notice it if it weren't about. It really is just there, and it will make money. Partially simply because of its features, partially since of curiosity seekers, and partially since of folks loyal to the brand name.<br /><br />No one particular is begrudging Apple for acquiring in on the portability craze. Following all, Apple might have taken that craze to extraordinary heights with the development and release of the iPod. So, it tends to make sense, then, to fuse the iPod with a cellular telephone. But, it's currently been accomplished before.<br /><br />Possibly the genuine concern is that if Apple released a telephone without web, e-mail, video player and other bells and whistles, that it merely wouldn't sell and just sit there on the shelves. If Lindsay Lohan had to sing on her own merits, she may possibly be joining that lonely phone. But, add some studio effects, produce some stylish videos and surround her with talented musicians, and she becomes passable and tolerable.<br /><br />In today's ultra-connected world, it appears that no one particular will buy a cell telephone for the expressed objective of having a telephone with you even though on the go. You want to have almost everything or your will appear to be nothing.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0dGVjaGluZm8uY29tL2lwaG9uZS01LWNvbmNlcHQtYXJ0LWJhc2VkLW9uLXBhc3QtcnVtb3JzLw__" target="_blank">iphone 5 rumors</a>
