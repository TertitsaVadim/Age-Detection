<br /><br />“I'm wearing my love dress,” responds the daughter-in-law, “We haven't made love in a long time.”
<br /><br />So the mother-in-law says, “Hm, maybe I should try that.”
<br /><br />She goes home to find her husband is not in, so she gets undressed. Two hours go by and finally she hears her husband's car. He walks in the front door and says, “What the fuck are you doing?”
<br /><br />“I'm wearing my love dress,” says the wife.
<br /><br />“Well,” responds the husband, “it needs to be ironed.”

One day the boy brought a girl over to diner. The mother was thrilled with her son's choice and couldn't wait for the wedding. However, the father was upset and, eventually, the boy asked, “Dad, why don't you seem happy with her. Mom likes her a lot.”
<br /><br />The father explained, “No son, there's nothing wrong with the girl. It's just that I cheated on your mother a long time ago, and the girl you've been dating is my daughter by that woman.”
<br /><br />So the boy dumped her and found himself another girl. Again, he brought her home to the mother's delight, but the father again told him this girl was actually his half-sister. The boy lost his temper and told his mother what his father had said.
<br /><br />Furious, the mother shouted, “Don't listen to him, sweetheart! He isn't even your father!”

He's slamming tequila left and right. He grabs one, drinks it, goes over to a window and jumps out. The guy who was sitting next to him couldn't believe that the guy had just done that. He was more surprised when, ten minutes later, the same guy, unscathed, comes walking back into the bar and sits back down next to him. The astonished guy asks &quot;How did you do that?  I just saw you jump out that window and we're hundreds of feet above the GROUND!&quot;. The jumper responds by slurring, &quot;Well, I don't get it either.  I slam a shot of tequila and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.&quot; He takes a shot, slams it down, goes to the window and jumps out. The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls until right before the ground, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the guy walks back into the bar. The other guy has to try it too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He drinks it and goes to the window and jumps.  As he reaches the bottom, he doesn't slow down at all...SPLAT! The first guy orders another shot of tequila and the bartender says to him, &quot;You're really an asshole when you're drunk, Superman.&quot;

All three find themselves in front of St. Peter at the Pearly Gates. They start begging him to give them another chance at life. St. Peter agrees but on one condition: they each have to give up something they truly enjoy.
<br /><br />Ru Paul says, &quot;I really love men, but I will give up screwing around with them.&quot;
<br /><br />Bill Gates says, &quot;I really love money, but I will give up all the money I have.&quot;
<br /><br />Ebert says.&quot; I really love food, but I'll give up pizza.&quot;
<br /><br />Soon, all three find themselves back on Earth. They start walking down street feeling very grateful. Suddenly, Ebert spots a pizzeria. He smells the aroma and can't help himself — he runs in there and eats a slice of pizza. POOF! He disappears.
<br /><br />Ru Paul and Bill Gates are astonished and agree that that won't happen to them. So they resume walking down the street when Bill Gates spots a shiny, new quarter. He thinks that if he picks it up, he can found a new company and become fabulously wealthy again. He bends down to pick up the quarter and POOF! Ru Paul disappears.

<br /><br />I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer.
<br /><br />Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.
<br /><br />Aren't you the guy from the Village People?
<br /><br />Hey, you must've been doing about 125 mph to keep up with me! Good Job!
<br /><br />I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a police officer.
<br /><br />I was going to be a cop, but I decided to finish high school instead.
<br /><br />Bad cop! No doughnut!
<br /><br />You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?
<br /><br />Gee, that gut sure doesn't inspire confidence.
<br /><br />Didn't I see you get your butt kicked on Cops?
<br /><br />Wow, you look just like the guy in the picture on my girlfriend's nightstand.
<br /><br />Is it true that people become cops because they are too dumb to work at McDonald's?
<br /><br />I pay your salary!
<br /><br />So, uh, you on the take or what?
<br /><br />Gee, Officer! That's terrific! The last officer only gave me a warning, too!
<br /><br />Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.
<br /><br />I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there is no other car around--that's how far ahead of me they are.
<br /><br />What do you mean, &quot;Have I been drinking?&quot; You're the trained specialist.
<br /><br />Well, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell off my lap and got lodged between the brake pedal and the gas pedal, forcing me to speed out of control.
<br /><br />Hey, is that a 9mm? That's nothing compared to this .44 magnum!
<br /><br />Hey, can you give me another one of those full body cavity searches?

<br />The Englishman says, ''I tell you, my wife is so stupid. Last week she went to the supermarket and bought $300 worth of meat because it was on sale, and we don't even have a fridge to keep it in.''
<br />The Scotsman agrees that she sounds pretty thick, but says his wife is thicker.
<br />''Just last week, she went out and spent $17,000 on a new car,'' he laments, ''and she doesn't even know how to drive!''
<br />The Irishman nods sagely, and agrees that these two woman sound like they both walked through the stupid forest and got hit by every branch.
<br />However, he still thinks his wife is dumber. ''Ah, it kills me everytime I think of it,'' he chuckles. ''My wife left to go on a trip to Greece. I watched her packing her bag, and she must have put about 100 condoms in there and she doesn't even have a penis!''

At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford, and tells him, ''Well, you've been such a good guy, and your invention ... the assembly line for the automobile changed the world. As a reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want.'' Ford thinks to himself about it, and says, ''I want to hang out with God Himself.''
<br /><br />The befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him to God. Ford then asks God, ''When you invented Woman, what were you thinking?'' God asks, ''What do you mean?'' ''Well,'' says Ford, ''You have some major design flaws in your invention:
<br /><br />1. There's too much front end protusion.
<br />2. It chatters way too much at high speeds.
<br />3. Maintenance is extremely high.
<br />4. It constantly need repainting, and refinishing.

<br /><br />&quot;Nice dress!&quot; = Nice cleavage!
<br /><br />&quot;You look tense, let me give you a massage.&quot; = I want to fondle you.
<br /><br />&quot;What's wrong?&quot; = What meaningless self-inflicted psychological trauma are you going through now?
<br /><br />&quot;What's wrong?&quot; = I guess sex tonight is out of the question.
<br /><br />&quot;I'm bored.&quot; = Do you want to have sex?
<br /><br />&quot;I love you.&quot; = Let's have sex now.
<br /><br />&quot;I love you, too.&quot; = Okay, I said it...we'd better have sex now!
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I like the way you cut your hair.&quot; = I liked it better before.
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I like the way you cut your hair.&quot; = $50 and it doesn't look that much different!
<br /><br />&quot;Let's talk.&quot; = I am trying to impress you by showing that I am a deep person and maybe then you'd like to have sex with me.
<br /><br />&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; = I want to make it illegal for you to have sex with other guys.
<br /><br />and FINALLY... (while shopping) &quot;I like that one better.&quot; = Just pick ANY dress and let's go home!
