<br /><br />1)  	Be sure to make all necessary reservations for movers for at least two weeks before you move out.
<br />2)  	Never mix stuff from different rooms in a single box.
<br />3)  	Use wardrobe boxes to make closets easier to pack. Clothes in drawers can be placed in suitcases.
<br />4)  	Get hold of wardrobe boxes for moving. These moving boxes make clothes in the closets easier to pack. Suitcases can be used for packing clothes in drawers.
<br />5)  	Books should only be packed in smaller <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">boxes for moving</a>, since they can get very heavy, fast.
<br />6)  	Always check on the user’s manual for large appliances if they have special instructions for moving.
<br />7)  	Fine china should never be wrapped with printed newsprints as these can cause unwanted stains.
<br />8)  	Dishes should be stacked upwards, when packed in boxes for moving.
<br />9)  	Important documents, such as: health records, passports, insurance information and photo albums, should be packed in a separate box.
<br />10)  As a rule of thumb: Never pack things beyond how much you can carry.
<br />11)  Never pack with boxes that you get from supermarkets or from food products. You’ll never know if those boxes are strong enough to hold up your possessions.
<br />12)  As much as possible, never use used boxes. You can never tell if those boxes are strong enough to hold up your possessions.
<br />13)  As the name goes, packing tape should be used for packing. Never use duct tape.
<br />14)  Put clear labels, including your name and new address, on all sides of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. New York or any large city, for instance, may have a lot of people that have the same name as you. Including complete details may make it easier for you to find your box in case it gets lost.
<br />15)  No matter how much convenience you can gain from doing so, never get rid of your children’s favorite things before you move out. Children tend to cling on certain things which would be very difficult for them to move on from.
<br />16)  In handling furniture that can be dismantled, be sure to tape all its peripherals to the main base.
<br />17)  Electronic equipment, such as printers, should be packed in their original boxes. Alternatively, you may use bubble wrap when packing these stuff.

<br />19)  As much as possible, leave out or dispose hazardous materials, such as explosives, bottled gases and ammunition, before moving. These materials can cause potential danger when cramped along with other objects. In addition, a moving company is not allowed by law to transport hazardous materials.
<br />20)  A separate box should be used for packing essential items that you’ll need right after the move. Aside from labeling the box, be sure that it would be the last thing added to the truck.
<br />21)  Utilize pads, foam, or bubble wrap, in packing fragile objects. In unpacking, make sure to do it over a padded surface.
<br />22)  Boxes should be taped. Never interlock the tops of the boxes.

<br /><br />Moving to a new place is one of the most stressful events in life. Plus, it can get pretty expensive, especially if you have to hire a moving truck. However, this task can be accomplished in many other means – which will depend on the number of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a> you’ve packed and the distance you have to travel. Most moving trucks are hired by the hour, but since not everyone can spare a buck in hiring one, you may want to consider other options. All you have to do is take a look at your present situation and have an open mind. There’s always a better way to accomplish daunting tasks.
<br /><br />Trailer – A trailer is as good as a moving truck in terms of space for storage. The first thing you should do is to locate a trailer you can use. Of course, you’ll always have the option of renting one, but ask around first and maybe you’ll find someone you know that owns a trailer that you can borrow. If you have a lot of things packed in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">boxes for moving</a>, buying a trailer can actually save you money since it can be used for extra storage even after you’ve moved to your new place. In addition, you can also rent it out after for extra income.
<br /><br />Pickup – Pickups are very easy to find. In fact, you may probably know someone who owns one or you own one yourself. Pickups are the most commonly utilized type of vehicle for moving stuff. Only thing you should remember is to fasten down securely all the boxes for moving or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a> before heading out on the highway.
<br /><br />Van – A van would be the next best thing, next to a trailer or a pickup. A van would be suitable for moving smaller furniture or appliances. Larger items such as a dining table may not fit in a van depending on its size.
<br /><br />Your Own Car – An average-sized car can surprisingly pack a lot of things. Though not as large as a trailer or a pickup, using your own car for moving stuff can be more practical. It may, however, take a few trips to move large furniture, but it can save you money from not hiring a moving truck.
<br /><br />Self Storage Units – There are portable storage units that you can pack yourself. This can be the way to go especially if you’re in a situation where you have to move out of your old place before you can move into a new one.
<br /><br />Shipping – If you’re just limited to smaller items and don’t have large furniture or appliances, you may just want to pack it in boxes for moving and ship it to your new address. Though this may be the most convenient option, be sure to always check and compare first the cost to any other alternatives.

<br /><br />Moving tips all over the internet or magazines usually seem too obvious. However, their aspects are often overlooked. As you read along the checklist, you’ll realize that transferring to a new address is more than just fitting your items in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">boxes for moving</a>. Here are some tips on how to achieve a stress-free move.
<br /><br />•	List down all necessary information. – These information should include your shipment registration number, your moving company’s contact details, and a list of the things you are moving. Also note what you are moving and the number of moving boxes. New York or the United States government in general, requires moving companies to report the items that they are moving. 
<br /><br />•	Designate a box for sheets and towels needed for the first night in your new home. – Especially for a long-distance move, it is very stressful to rummage through all the moving boxes. New York is such a busy place. It would take a while before you can move in line to purchase these essentials.
<br /><br />•	Your fridge should smell fresh naturally. -  After clearing and drying the inside of your refrigerator, utilize natural products, such as baking soda or charcoal, in a nylon stocking and place it inside during the move. This can keep the interior smelling fresh and clean.
<br /><br />•	 Don’t forget your phone book. – Keep your old phone book as you may need to make necessary calls to neighbors or businesses back in your old hometown.
<br /><br />•	 As a rule of thumb, heavy items should be packed in small boxes, while lighter items should go in larger moving boxes. New York is a tough place to move into. So it would be better if you’d be as independent as possible. Take note that you may have to carry the boxes from room to room. So you better make sure that you can lift them by yourself.
<br /><br />•	Have your calling card ready. – Before the moving truck leaves for your new home, give him your contact number where you can be easily reached. Be sure that the contact number that you’ll give to the truck foreman will work at all times. The moving truck has most of your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. NYC is a big place and it would be very easy for the moving truck to get lost.
<br /><br />•	 As much as possible, have items of high value conveniently near you. – Highly sentimental items are irreplaceable, so it would be best if you’d take them with you in the car. As an added caution, if you’re packing framed photos or art, cushion them with sheets or folded blankets in between for added support.
<br /><br />•	Plates should be stacked and placed above other moving boxes. – Aside from plates, record albums and other fragile items should be placed on the top end vertically.
<br /><br />•	Mark your moving boxes and items. – If you got these items from the bathroom, you should clearly mark “BATHROOM” on all sides of the moving box. This would avoid confusion, and save you the energy from looking for toilet paper, for instance.

<br /><br />In most cases, fragile items, such as fine china or antique paintings, require special packing and handling before being moved. But some of us may not know that there are other items that require extra care, as well. These items, which moving companies will not move if not properly prepared, should not be moved along with other <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>.
<br /><br />Here’s a checklist on what not to bring, or let moving companies move for you, on moving day.
<br /><br />*     Hazardous Materials – These items are flammable, corrosive, or explosive. Depending on what state you reside in or plan to move to, these hazardous materials are usually illegal to move and must be properly disposed beforehand. If you have any of these items on the list, you may call your local recycling pickup service. You may also ask for assistance from the fire station or the nearest EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) office on how you can safely dispose these items.
<br />o   	Acid
<br />o   	Sterno – hydrocarbon jelly packaged in a small can for use as a portable heat source for cooking
<br />o   	Gasoline
<br />o   	Charcoal
<br />o   	Pesticides
<br />o   	Motor Oil
<br />o   	Fertilizer
<br />o   	Lighter Fluid
<br />o   	Car Batteries
<br />o   	Liquid Bleach
<br />o   	Aerosols
<br />o   	Live ammunition
<br />o   	Kerosene
<br />o   	Chlorine
<br />o   	Used chemistry sets
<br />o   	Paint (Enamels and automotive paint) - Water based paint in cans is not flammable, but the aerosol that acts as a propellant can be.
<br />o   	Fireworks
<br />o   	Paint Strippers that contain methylene chloride
<br />o   	Armed Weapons
<br />o   	Herbicides
<br />o   	Lamp Oil
<br />o   	Cleaning Liquids
<br />o   	Ammonium
<br />o   	Propane
<br />o   	Perishables
<br /><br />If you’re moving locally, through the use of the right moving supplies and proper packing, it is possible to bring perishable goods with you. Just remember that spoilage can occur quickly even in cold temperatures. So be careful in handling dairy products, meat and eggs.
<br /><br />Moving longer distances may, however, obligate you to dispose perishables. In the process, look for a new home for your large plants that will not fit in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. Household or indoor plants may be brought with you if they are properly packed and stored.
<br /><br />ü      Highly-Valuable Items – These items don’t necessarily have a high price value. These items are rather highly sentimental and should not be shipped or moved via a moving company. As much as possible, have items of high value conveniently near you. No matter how far or how near you’re moving, it is very important to photocopy all important documents just in case. This includes identification, licenses, or insurance records. When packing, along with other important moving supplies, you should be certain if you really want a moving company to move these items for you.
<br />o   	Video tapes that contain personal footage
<br />o   	Home movies
<br />o   	Address Books
<br />o   	Personal Files – such as licenses, passports, birth certificates, insurance records
<br />o   	Flight Tickets
<br />o   	Photos or Photo Albums
<br />o   	Keys (Car, House, Safety Boxes, etc.)
<br />o   	Wills or Deeds
<br />o   	Tax Records
<br />o   	School Records
<br />o   	Jewelry
<br />o   	Personal Collections (Coins, Stamps, Trading Cards, etc.)
<br />o   	Letters
<br />o   	Computer Software
<br />o   	Computer Hard drives
<br />o   	Artwork
<br />o   	Medicine

<br /><br />Just like how Alicia Keys belts it, the streets in New York will make you feel brand new. New York City is such a tough place to live in, that if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
<br /><br />But before you can experience the glitz and glamour of New York, you have to move there of course. In this article, we’ll take a step by step approach on how to survive the concrete jungle. So get set, have <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a> and fill those moving boxes. New York is waiting.
<br /><br />Getting to New York: Things to Remember
<br /><br />* No matter how urbanized the city of New York is, there are still many buildings that don’t have elevators. Without an elevator, you may have to increase the effort and allocate more time if you’re moving into the building. Of course, you can’t force moving companies to scale up the long flight of stairs, to your fifth floor pad. Let’s say they will, you can’t prevent moving companies from charging you extra for their trouble. As a rule of thumb, heavy items should be packed in small boxes, while lighter items should go in larger moving boxes. New York is such a busy place. You can’t just expect anyone to help you carry your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>.
<br /><br />* The streets of New York are not designed for moving trucks. If you’re moving alone, just don’t drive the rental truck if you don’t feel comfortable on narrow streets. However, moving companies may need to use smaller trailer vans to get through the busy streets, where big trucks don’t fit. Unfortunately, this will mean extra costs for you.
<br /><br />* Traffic rules in New York are very explicit. If you’re the kind of person who carelessly reads signs, you most likely will get a ticket with just a minor misstep. Avoid parking on the wrong spots by scoping them out way ahead in advance.
<br /><br />* Most buildings impose move-in/ move-out times, as well as access times to the elevator. Before you move in, check with your building if they have such rules.
<br /><br />* There’s no such thing as a perfect move. Moving will always take longer than what you’ve hoped for. Expect the unexpected. There may be times when the sun already has set and you’re still dealing with your moving boxes. New York, though, never sleeps. So, you don’t have to worry.
<br /><br />During Moving Day: For a Smooth Move
<br /><br />* Get hold of all necessary New York State documents, such as a driver’s license or those needed for health insurance. Always remember to keep them somewhere safe.
<br /><br />* If you’re hiring a mover, be sure to understand insurance options even before choosing one. You can always ask moving companies about your options.
<br /><br />* You have to contact your mover if you need to file a damage claim. They are bound by law to respond to a written claim within 30 days and resolve it within 120 days, in writing.

<br /><br />Moving companies are hired to transport all our possessions to a new home. However, due to the countless numbers of companies that offer these types of services in New York, knowing which one to trust and hire may be tricky. In this article, we’ll guide you step by step on how to find a reliable moving company.
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />Determine which kind of mover you need to hire. There are moving companies that offer relocation services, interstate moving services, local moving services, pack and stack services, household shipping or trucking services. You should already have an idea on who to hire, even before you pack your moving boxes. NYC has local directories that you can browse for contact information of moving companies. 
<br /><br />2
<br />Ask your friends, neighbors, or co-workers for advice, personal recommendations and warnings. 
<br /><br />3
<br />Get in touch with several of the recommended companies. Make inquiries on how long these companies have been in the business. If they’ve been in the business long enough, that would probably mean they offer exceptional service. In addition, don’t forget to ask how much experience their packers and drivers have. If they offer storage, or interstate transport, be sure to ask if they are licensed.
<br /><br />4
<br />To narrow your choices, only hire movers that are licensed and regulated. You can inquire and verify with state agencies that regulate transportation services. You may also flip through the pages of your local phone book under a Public Utility Commission (PUC) or Department of Transportation (DOT).
<br /><br />5
<br />Hiring a moving company that is a member of a trade organization, such as the American Movers Conference, may work to your advantage especially if you have to resolve a dispute.
<br /><br />6
<br />To ensure that the moving company you are about to hire can be trusted, check with your local Better Business Bureau and check whether any complaints have been filed against the company.
<br /><br />7
<br />As your choices continue to narrow, call each company and ask for estimates. 
<br /><br />8
<br />Pick a moving company.
<br /><br />Things to Keep in Mind
<br /><br />*Estimates can either be binding or nonbinding. Binding estimates mean that you can’t be obliged to pay more than the amount of the estimate while nonbinding estimates may cost you more than what was estimated. Either way, it would be better if you prepare an additional ten percent of the cost, just in case. A written contract is always given to you before they start handling your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. NYC is a good city to move in to. Start packing.
<br /><br />*Usually, movers offer more than one service to customers. You may divide needed services among various companies that offer the best prices. You may also have one company to do it all.
<br /><br />*Be assertive and go directly to the point when asking questions. Don’t settle for rude or unfriendly company representatives. They’re not the only ones that can handle your moving boxes. New York has a lot of accredited movers. You don’t have to worry.
<br /><br />*Watch out for hidden costs, packing fees are sometimes charged to clients who don’t utilize <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">boxes for moving</a>.

<br /><br />When you have to move from one place to another, the valuable possessions you own may get damaged along the way. Old tricks, like interlocking the flops on your moving boxes, are simply not strong enough. Properly taping the seams of the moving boxes with high quality packing tape lessens the chances of anything falling out of the bottom. Moving supplies of every shape, quality and size are available. Always go for heavy duty boxes, if you’re packing heavier items. Search online for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. New York has a lot of local online shops that sell cheap moving boxes. Whether you’re planning to buy new or used moving boxes, NYC has the largest selection of cheap moving supplies to protect your belongings. Here are some tips on how to properly tape your moving boxes.
<br /><br />The things you’ll need:
<br />*Moving Boxes – Choosing the right materials can make the difference in ensuring that the valuable possessions you own safely arrive at their destination.
<br />*Packing Tape – can be clear or opaque, and used for closing packages for shipment.
<br />*Tape Dispenser (optional) – Designed for easy handling of packing tape.
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />Assemble your box into shape, and enclose all of the flaps. Lay the box on a flat surface, with the bottom of the box facing up.
<br /><br />2
<br />Run the tape dispenser (if in use) along the center, between the two opening flaps. The tape should extend about halfway along either side of the box. To make it easier for you, just start on one side of the box, and extend the tape over the center opening and down the other side.
<br /><br />3
<br />Tape should be applied along the two edges of the box aligned with the center flaps. Apply tape straight down the middle of the edge, evenly securing both sides.
<br /><br />4
<br />Properly secure the box by making sure you run your fingers firmly along all of the tape. Air bubbles should be prevented, as these can lessen the strength of the tape.
<br /><br />5
<br />Once done, flip the box onto its bottom and start packing.
<br /><br />6

<br /><br />Moving is not only stressful, but may also be costly. However, you can significantly cut costs by shopping around for moving boxes. New York moving and rental companies sell boxes of every shape and size available, but you might be surprised when you see their steep price tags. With a little research and planning, you can get hold of high quality boxes for a fraction of the cost, some even free of charge. Whether you’re planning to buy new or used <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>, NYC has the largest selection of cheap moving supplies to protect your belongings.
<br /><br />Before you start, here are the things you’ll need:
<br />Written estimates from moving and truck rental companies
<br />A checklist of the household items you need to move
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />Estimate the number of boxes you’ll need by using a moving calculator. Moving calculators are available all over the Internet, free of charge.
<br /><br />2
<br />Get estimates from three, or more, moving companies, if you’re planning to hire one. The estimates should be detailed, with a breakdown on services. You’ll easily make a distinction between the cost of the boxes separately from the things like transportation and packing. Always remember that you are not obliged to buy moving boxes from the company that does the moving for you.
<br /><br />3
<br />If you’re planning to rent a truck and move your things on your own, get the latest prices on moving boxes from the rental company. In most cases, their prices are significantly lower than those of a moving company.
<br /><br />4
<br />Search online for moving boxes. NYC has a lot of local online shops that sell cheap moving supplies. Most companies will usually ship boxes directly to your home at prices much lower than those of hardware stores or moving companies. Moving kits, which includes boxes, tape, bubble wrap, and markers, can also be purchased online.
<br /><br />5
<br />Browse the “used box” section of online companies, and check the prices. Some of these boxes are technically new, as they are equivalent to “factory overruns”. Other boxes in these sections have only been used once. Before you make a purchase, be sure that the company guarantees you that the boxes are in perfect condition.
<br /><br />6
<br />You may also check for freebies in classified ads on your local newspaper, Craigslist.com or other similar websites. Some boxes are given away free of charge by many people who have recently moved.
<br /><br />7
<br />Save and properly store your boxes when you’ve arrived at your destination. Don't leave valuable cardboard boxes lying around just anywhere. Properly stored <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a> can still be used next time you have to move.
<br /><br />Tips &amp; Warnings
<br />*Research on what boxes you’ll need for your belongings. Wardrobe boxes can be used to hang clothing, while special boxes are used to protect glassware and dishes.
<br /><br />*As much as possible, avoid using free boxes from a supermarket. Some of these boxes are not so sturdy and could contain bugs.

<br /><br />Moving to New York, which has its own pros and cons, is one of the biggest steps one has to take in life. No matter what the reason behind it, one thing’s for sure, moving to New York is ranked among the most stressful of activities. But with tips, you’ll learn how to manage the challenges of making the transition from one home to another. These tips can be done by anyone, at anytime. Maximize space, save time, and safely transport your belongings by expertly packing them with the right <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>. Here’s how:
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />As early as possible, start collecting all your newspapers, packaging materials, and moving boxes. New York real estate can be very expensive. Collecting or recycling these materials as far in advance of your move as possible can ultimately save you money. When storing them, be sure to keep them in a dry, well insulated space, rather than somewhere unprotected from dust and bugs.
<br /><br />Go search online for cheap moving boxes. New York is a very busy place. No matter where you go, there are at least ten people who want to do the same thing as you. Unless you want to wait in line to buy boxes, go purchase them online. Plus, you can easily research what types of boxes you will need.
<br /><br />Buying packaging supply stores should be your last resort.
<br /><br />2
<br />Pick a room where you want to store moving boxes that have already been packed. By doing so, you can prevent boxes from stacking up all over your house. You can just let yourself forget that you’re in the process of having to pack for a move, if the moving boxes are stored in one place – preferably the guest room.
<br /><br />3
<br />To stabilize your boxes, tightly tape the bottoms before you start using them. Once the boxes are fully packed, tape its top shut and boldly mark all four sides to indicate the items inside. The boxes could be named either for its contents or for the room in which it’s intended for, such as “Plates” or “Kitchen.” If the contents of a box are breakable, be sure to mark it with “Fragile” on all sides, including the top.
<br /><br />4
<br />Items that you can do without until well after your move should be packed first. These items include, extra linens, utensils rarely used and fine china reserved for special occasions.
<br /><br />5
<br />Use your collected newspapers and packaging materials to wrap all fragile items. To keep them secure, line your fragile items with folded sheets when packing them in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. New York City traffic is really bad throughout the day. Expect your trip to be a bumpy one.
<br /><br />6
<br />As a rule of thumb, lighter items, such as linens, should go into big boxes while heavier items, such as books and dishes, should go into small ones.
<br /><br />7
<br />Set aside a small box for packing all the things you’ll need within the first couple of days after your move, such as dishes, clothes, and personal care items.

<br /><br />5
<br />Tightly seal all the openings of the moving boxes with packing tape. Slowly tape the inner edges of the two flaps to secure them. Two pieces of tape should also be applied on the ends of the flaps to hold them down solidly. On the side of the box, using the permanent marker, boldly write the room where the box is from and a short description of the objects inside. Don’t forget to write FRAGILE on all the sides of the fragile boxes.
<br /><br />Tips &amp; Warnings
<br />As much as possible, never pack or cramp a lot of heavy items on large boxes. The box can easily break from its heavy load.

<br /><br />There’s no perfect way of unpacking your boxes after a big move. Everyone’s different. Some may love packing and hate unpacking and others may feel the other way around. So you will not get lost in among all those boxes, unpacking needs a bit of planning and strategizing. Some movers suggest unpacking one room at a time, while others may find unpacking the essentials first more effective. Unpacking takes a lot of time and effort. Here’s how:
<br /><br />1
<br />Get the necessary items unpacked first then work on the things that aren’t as crucial to your day to day activities.
<br /><br />2
<br />Make sure you have a list of all the things that you’re moving, either the one that the movers provided or the one that you created yourself as part of your home inventory. Unpack the essentials box first. This box should most probably be the first boxes off the truck or something you’ve taken with you in the car. The essentials box should contain everything you may need for a couple of nights after your move.
<br /><br />3
<br />Unpack the kitchen. If you’ve labeled the boxes accordingly, you’ll easily locate what you need. If you have spare time, it is highly suggested to line the cupboards first. Unpack only what you need, such as pots and pans, until everything is out of the boxes. Get the essential appliances hooked up and any small appliances that will make life a little more pleasant, such as the coffee pot and toaster.
<br /><br />4
<br />Arrange the beds on their respective rooms and unpack the linens for each room. If you want the beds ready for your first night easily, pack the set of linens that usually accompany each bed in separate see through <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>.
<br /><br />5
<br />Now unpack the bathroom. Like what you did on previous boxes, unpack the things that are most important, such as the shower curtain and towels.
<br /><br />6
<br />If you were lucky enough to get hold of plans to your new home before the big move, then arranging furniture in the living room, patio, and bedrooms should be reasonably simple. If you need to rearrange furniture, make a plan beforehand so you only have to do it once. Large furniture should only be pieced back together once you know where they’ll be placed.
<br /><br />7
<br />Always ask for help from other family members in unpacking moving supplies for each bedroom. Likewise, furniture placement or closet arrangement should be done first before unpacking moving supplies.
<br /><br />8
<br />One of the final rooms to unpack is the garage. Since most garage items are not as essential as those from the kitchen or bathroom, try to organize the space before you start to unpack. Get the right set of tools to keep the space dynamic. This should include extra shelving or storage boxes.
<br /><br />9
<br />Unpack the patio items at your own leisure. If you’re moving in the summer, fire up the barbecue first, just so you won’t need pots or pans. It’s a great way to ease up the burden when there are so many other things to do.
<br /><br />10
<br />Take some time to enjoy your new space once you have the main essentials completely unpacked from your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>.

Here are the best ways to save money from buying the right <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>.
<br /><br />One of the aspects of moving is purchasing packing and moving supplies. If you are planning to move, having the right <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">boxes for moving</a> is essential to ensure you that your belongings don’t end up damaged in transit. Additionally, having everything you need will make a stressful task much simpler. Though buying moving supplies may cost a little money, it will be well worth it when all your belongings make it to your new home in one piece. Here are the best ways to save money from buying the right moving supplies:
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />It’s very important to choose the right moving boxes. Check local or online stores, and moving supply companies to find the best deals. Whenever possible, purchase boxes that are the same shape and size. It is much easier to load boxes of the same size and shape on moving trucks. Though it’s very tempting to get hold of used boxes for free at supermarkets, you can’t be assured that these are clean and of decent quality.
<br /><br />2
<br />Purchase plenty of high-quality packing tape and a tape dispenser. Without a dispenser, the daunting task of getting the tape onto all of your boxes will become much worse. Purchase a commercial quality dispenser, since cheap ones will easily break. Try buying different colors of packing tape. Consider using a different color for each room. This will make it easier as you unpack your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>.

<br />To protect your valuables, get hold of bubble wrap. You can get bubble wrap at discount stores or local moving stores. Look for bubble wrap that has perforations on every foot or so. Perforated bubble wrap can be easily ripped into pieces as you pack.

<br />If you have lots of old blankets and towels lying around your home, you may use these to cover large furniture that you don’t want to get damaged, such as the dining table.
<br /><br />5
<br />Purchase a couple of black permanent markers to label all of your moving boxes. You’ll be using these markers to write the contents of each box, if it’s fragile and its designated room when it arrives in your new home.
<br /><br />6
<br />Get a few rolls of newsprint packing paper. This can be used to wrap items and will also come in handy when you want to load empty space in a moving box.
<br /><br />7
<br />Create a moving notebook. A moving notebook keeps track of everything that needs to be done, including all the things you should be moving.
<br /><br />8
<br />Prepare lots of garbage bags as you pack. You’ll surely find plenty of things that you don’t need any longer. If you keep large contractors bags close by, you can simply get rid of things as you pack.
<br /><br />10
<br />Though you won’t need a box cutter when you’re packing, this will come in handy when you get to your new home since you’ll need it to get in all of your boxes as you unpack.

<br /><br />Moving plans ease the stress of moving and help ensure you do not forget anything. Planning step by step what needs to be fulfilled will help keep your family well organized and guarantee everything is done in time for the movers to arrive. Set your moving plan in an accessible spot where everyone in the family can see it and refer to it when necessary. Here’s how to plan out for a move:
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />Get hold and create a moving notebook. A moving notebook keeps track of everything that needs to be done, including all the things you should be moving. In this notebook, draw a map of your home and list down in detail what needs to be done in each room before moving.
<br /><br />2
<br />Make a time line. Boldly write your moving date in your notebook and count down how many days are left until the movers arrive. List down times when you can start packing and organizing your moving boxes and determine deadlines for each item to be carried out.
<br /><br />3
<br />Make a list of everything to be packed in moving boxes. Segregate the items in the house based on its importance and frequency of use. For instance, things you use day to day, such as dishes, clothes and bathroom toiletries, will be of greater importance and packed in moving boxes last. Items, such as picture frames, paintings and books are less important and will be the first items that should go in moving boxes and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>. NYC has online shops, such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbQ__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.boxesaz.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.boxesaz.com</a></a>, that sell affordable, high-quality boxes.
<br /><br />4
<br />Assign a place to store packed moving boxes. New York though has a lot of storage facilities where you can store your boxes. Look for a room in your home that is not used everyday, such as a guest room or office. Let everyone know that when they are done packing a moving box, it should be stored in the designated room.
<br /><br />5
<br />Make all necessary changes of addresses. Inform everyone or every business entity of your change of address, which includes the post office, doctors and banks. Get in touch with the utility and cable companies to arrange for new service to be installed and your existing service to be disconnected.
<br /><br />6
<br />Clear up your yard for loading the moving truck. Lift your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a> out of the house and arrange your front yard by room. As much as possible, load the boxes and furniture by rooms to make unloading the truck much easier.
<br /><br />7
<br />As what you did for your current home, draw a map of your new home. Make a map of your new home where you can write down what needs to be accomplished before loading the moving truck. List down what needs to be done and what furniture and boxes will be placed in those rooms when the truck arrives.

But with these packing tips, your move will commence as smooth as possible.
<br /><br />Moving can never be fun. In fact, it is ranked among the most stressful of activities. Packing for a move from one home to another will definitely take some time and effort. So learn how to make the transition as stress free as possible. Save time, secure your belongings and maximize space by packing your valuables with the right <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3Zpbmctc3VwcGxpZXM_" target="_blank">moving supplies</a>. Here’s how:
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />As soon as you know you’re moving to a new home, start saving boxes, newspapers and packaging materials. Since these materials are prone to wear and tear from dust and bugs, store them in a dry, well insulated space, preferably inside an unused room in your current house.
<br /><br />If you need more moving boxes, you may always check with your local supermarkets. Most will have some used boxes that you can get for free. However, keep in mind that these boxes are not of high-quality and may be infested with bugs or may be smeared with food residue.
<br /><br />As much as possible, purchase moving boxes from a trusted moving supplies store. You may surf online or look through the yellow pages of your local phone directory for the best deals out in the market.
<br /><br />2
<br />Designate a room where you can store moving boxes as you pack them. This way you can prevent boxes from piling up all over the house even if you start packing several weeks in advance. If they’re stored in one room, such as the guest room, you can simply forget that you’re in the process of having to pack for a move, just by closing the door.
<br /><br />3
<br />Securely tape all the bottoms of each and every box before you start packing them. Once full, tape the top tight and label all boxes on all sides with a black marker to indicate its contents. You may name it either for the room in which it’s intended for or the items in the box, such as “Pots and Pans” or “Kitchen.” Make sure to label all boxes with breakable items as “Fragile” on all sides.
<br /><br />4
<br />Pack first anything that is less important or those that you can do well without a couple of days after the move, such as extra towels, appliances you rarely use and picture frames.
<br /><br />5
<br />Using the newspapers you saved, wrap all fragile items for added protection. Line your fragile boxes with sheets or light blankets. You may also want to layer towels on the inner sides of your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a>. NYC based packaging supply stores may also sell newsprint wrapping paper for this purpose.
<br /><br />6
<br />Pack large boxes with lighter items, such as blankets and bulky kitchen appliances. Pack small boxes with heavier items, such as books and vases.
<br /><br />7
<br />Have a box ready for packing items you’ll need within the first couple of days of your move. Mark it accordingly and load it last on the moving truck.

<br /><br />Who says moving is fun? The task of packing is somehow as complicated as dealing with all the paperwork involved. But no matter how stressful the situation may get, it’s not hard to survive a move to another state. These tips will help you stay organized, pack efficiently and unpack without ripping through all your moving boxes looking for things.
<br /><br />Steps
<br />1
<br />Leave all things you haven’t used in the past two years. If you haven’t used it in the last 2 years, chances are you never will in your new home. Instead of packing it and transporting it with you, get rid of it pronto.
<br /><br />2
<br />Start packing the minute you know you are moving. Waiting until the last minute to get started will surely cause a lot of delays. As soon as your move is official, go through your home and start packing all things you know you won’t need until the move is over. You may start at the basement and attic before moving to a different room.
<br /><br />3
<br />Clearly label all moving boxes with the new room name and details of the contents. Almost all <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ib3hlc2F6LmNvbS9tb3ZpbmctYm94ZXM_" target="_blank">moving boxes</a> (New York) have small sections pre-printed where you can check off the appropriate room the box is intended for. Be sure to label the boxes on all sides, since lifting boxes to see where the box underneath belongs is time consuming and, of course, frustrating.
<br /><br />4
<br />Assign each and every box a number and keep a notebook listing each box number and details of its contents. When you need to find your favorite coffee mug, it’s much easier to look it up on your notebook instead of ripping through your moving boxes labeled “Kitchen”. If it’s in box #6, then locate box #6.
<br /><br />5
<br />For those important items you know you’ll need as soon as you get to your new home, mark the boxes with a huge symbol like a heart, a star or asterisk. Once you get at the new house, pick a designated area for these items and inform the movers that all boxes with your symbol are to go in that area. This way, rather than looking through a garage pile for your toothbrush; you’ll be able to easily find it in the designated area for important moving boxes. NYC based moving companies will gladly offer you assistance every step of the way.
<br /><br />6
<br />If you are moving with small children, have the movers load the kid’s rooms into the moving truck last. By doing so, these rooms are unloaded first. While the movers are busy unloading the rest of your belongings, you may start arranging the kid’s rooms and they will be ready to settle in their new room the very first night.
<br /><br />7
<br />As you move, take all things you know you need right away, like your medication, with you. Move these items in your car so they don’t get lost or mixed up with any of your other belongings.
