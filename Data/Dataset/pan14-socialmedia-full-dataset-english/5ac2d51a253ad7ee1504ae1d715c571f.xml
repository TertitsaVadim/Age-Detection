Well her youngest son wanted to be a professional wrestler, and we could not decide how to make this costume. without any warning her son comes running into the living room wearing only one of her thongs the straps pulled up over his shoulders. I could not help but to laugh as my friends face turn bright red. To make matters worst the preacher of her church was sitting in the living room with us.

<br /><br />One evening an old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes
<br />on inside people. 
<br /><br />He said, &quot;My son, the battle is between two 'wolves' inside us all.
<br /><br />One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed,
<br />arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false
<br />pride, superiority and ego.
<br /><br />The other is Good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility,
<br />kindness, benevolence, empathy, generousity, truth, compassion and
<br />faith.&quot;
<br /><br />The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his
<br />grandfather, &quot;Which wolf wins?&quot;
<br /><br />The old Cherokee simply replied, &quot;The one you feed.&quot;

<br /><br />Long ago an Indian boy was born to a maiden Indian girl of about 17 years of age. Her parents feared that he would be looked upon as a bad omen because he had no actual human father to be found. So they put him in a great fire to kill him, but when they returned home there he was safe and sound. Then they put him in a great river to drown, but once again he was well and fine when they arrived back home. After this they thought it to be best not to try to interfere with the boys well being. He grew up to be a very wise young man teaching great medicine to all the people. He was especially good to the young children and old people. This he said was the way every one should follow because it was honorable in the eyes of the great spirit whom he called Father. He also taught much about ceremonies and how to keep and follow them. Then one day he went down to the great water (sea ) and began to carve out a giant canoe from one big solid piece of stone. After the canoe was finished he took one of the chips of left over stone and carved out a small cross. He told to them to keep this stone cross to remember him and all his teachings he had given to them. He told his mother not to worry about him, because he had more work to do with other people across the great water. He then climbed into the stone canoe and floated out to sea until he was so far he vanished out of sight. Once he reached the other side the people again tried to persecute and kill him. This they could not  fully do, because he was the Great Spirits own son. He told the Indian people that one day he would return to them as his own family. 
<br /><br />The Native Americans closely keep his teachings in the Indian communities.
<br /><br />AH-HO IN HIS NAME
<br />                                                                                                 AMEN

The paths we all must walk in this life, is very sacre d to the American Indian people.  Each direction is marked with a color, and each is assigned spirit helper by the Creator.  ( East - yellow, South - red, West - black, North - white. )   Each has also been given a different gift by the Creator to help the people, and they are honored because they too are sacred
<br /><br />I have passed it onto my children so they may keep the tribal stories going. I am passing them on to all who would like to read. Please Enjoy.
<br /><br />The East is where the sun rises. It brings new light, new beginnings, and understanding. It is also the direction of Spring, birth, and Babies. The Herb associated with this direction is Sweetgrass, which brings the Creator's blessing.
<br /><br />The South is where the sun is at its highest and warmest. The gifts are summer, growth, the young and our Women. The Plant associated with this direction is Cedar, which heals, brings God's blessings and calls his attention to our prayers.
<br /><br />The West is where the sun sets and the day comes to fulfillment. It is associated with Autumn, fulfillment, and the Adults. It is also the direction from which comes the Thunders who bring us water, which gives us life. The Herb associated with this direction is Sage, which purifies and sends evil away.
<br /><br />The North is where the cold harsh winds of Winter come from. It is associated with hardship, cleansing, the Elder and purification. If you can face this direction
<br />and stand firm you will learn patience and endurance. The Plant associated with this direction is Tobacco, which is an offering used to carry our prayers to the Creator. It is usually placed on Mother Earth after you are through praying or placed in a fire.

<br /><br />The other night I was invited out for the night with  &quot;the girls.&quot; I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, &quot; I promise ! &quot; Well, the hours passed and the margaritas went down way too easy, Around 3 am, ( a bit loaded ) I arrived home. Just as I got into the door, the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times. Quickly realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. Really proud of myself for coming up with a quick-witted solution ( even when totally smashed ), in order to escape a prolong conflict with him.
<br />The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, and I told him midnight. He did not seem pissed off at all. Whew ! Got away with that one ! Then he said, &quot;We need a new cuckoo clock.&quot; When I asked him why, he said. &quot; Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said &quot;OH SHIT.&quot; cuckooed 4 more times, cleared it's throat, cuckooed 3 more times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, tripped over the coffee table and then farted.&quot;

Time pass her innocents continue the only worries she has is what cartoons to watch and which toy to play with. First day of school begins. She is excited and happy, I am doing my best to be strong as she walks into the school. My heart sobs as I watch her disappear into the school. My little girl is growing up so fast. Graduation from 6th grade what a happy day for all of us.  First day of Jr High, so scare she walks through the doors. Once inside she finds her friends and many new people to become friends with. The only cares are, how do I look, does he think I am cute. Age 13 1/2  they get the bad news. Your daughter has scoliosis, and no type of brace will work to fix the curvature of her spine. The only option you have is surgery. I look at my husband in total disbelief. How can this be ? How did it happen?  Why did it happen?  Our daughter looks at us What about Basketball? What about volleyball?  My eyes tear up as I listen to her worries. How do you tell a 13 1/2 yr old that the life she knows will no longer be the life she lives.  Over 3/4 of her spine will have rods and screws on each side of it to hold it in a straight position for the rest of her life.  So young so innocent  so many worries. WHY !!!!!!!!

Her surgery is scheduled for March 24, 2008. We found out there is a 1 in 2,000 chance that she could be partially or fully paralyzed. We also found out she will need a blood transfusion as well. She will stay 5 days in the hospital and 6 weeks recovery time at home if all goes well . I am trying to be strong for everyone right now. I wish I could say that I am strong when I am alone but I cant. It has taken its toll on me mentally and medically.
<br /><br />I will keep everyone updated as I receive more info.  Thank You for all the prayers.

<br />Sitting here I ponder 
<br />do I make a difference in time
<br />does what I do have a purpose
<br />will my medicine be viewed as kind
<br /><br />Standing here I wonder
<br />will the next call be for me
<br />do I have the skill and knowledge
<br />or even the vision to see
<br /><br />Kneeling here I'm thankful
<br />you've not been made to feel
<br />the agony that surrounds me
<br />or the blood that I've seen spilled
<br /><br />Running here I know
<br />few would take on this task
<br />so stop for a moment 
<br />and please do what I ask
<br /><br />Don't ponder your support
<br />or wonder if I will
<br />just thank God that I am
<br />but know for certain I feel

<br />I've seen life pass before my eyes
<br />not my own but others
<br />through unforgiving demise
<br /><br />This work I've done has changed me so
<br />how much deep
<br />I'm not sure I know
<br /><br />But there is one certainty
<br />of which I pray you will find
<br />it's that you capture each moment
<br />and not be frivolous with time
<br /><br />Nothing here last forever
<br />least of all this fragile life
<br />so while you're here make the most
<br />open your heart, choose right
<br /><br />You see, I've heard what they wanted
<br />those that now do not say
<br />it was to love for one more moment
<br />to fully live one last day
<br /><br />So take these words as they are
<br />and hold them close to your heart
<br />because a patient told me when it matters most
<br />it will be to late to start

<br /><br />RAGING WHISPER
<br /><br />I still hear the raging whisper
<br />of calls I no longer run
<br />streets that now rest quiet
<br />corners to which I have come
<br /><br />I pass silently enough
<br />marking them only with my stare
<br />but they speak to me so very loudly
<br />as if I didn't care
<br /><br />Peaceful as I am now
<br />my fight still lingers on 
<br />a battle between all that was right 
<br />my thoughts of what went wrong
<br /><br />I don't wonder if I'm going
<br />just concerned about what I've brought
<br />I'm still standing here with compassion 
<br />but I know what I have thought
<br /><br />There never is much comfort
<br />in what's left in the end to hold
<br />but the streets have no doubt spoken
<br /> to those who were once so bold

Everything looks great with the rods, her back is 90% straighten. About 3 days into her recovery we discovered Annie's Bowel was pinched ( one of the risk with the surgery ) and she had to have 2 tubes put down her nose. One is for suction which goes into her stomach to suction out the gastric juices out of stomach ( so she is not throwing up 24/7) . The pinched bowel prevents her from being able to eat . The second tube is her feeding tube which goes into her intestines passed the pinched area. This tube provides food to the intestines /body.  So we will be in the hospital for a while. I will keep everyone informed of her condition. 
<br /><br />Thank you for the prays

She is now on a clear liquid diet as well as being fed by the picc line and NJ tube ( feeding ). She is still unable to have a bowel movement which is very concerning. Her spirits are a lot better today she is joking and telling us she is hungry.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />   We still dont not know when she will be coming home yet, hoping it is soon.

After 5-6 weeks of worrying and praying my daughter is finally home. The surgery went well her back is 98% straight, and she grew 1 3/4 inches do to the surgery.  There was a major complication after the surgery which had us very scared and feared that she was not going to make it.  About a 5-6 days after surgery the Doctors discovered that my daughter had a pinched bowel.  The pinched area ( blockage ) was where her stomach and Intestines meet.  Because of this problem she was unable to eat and all her gastric juices that her stomach was producing had no where to go except upwards. Because of this my daughter was vomiting non stop. She became very weak and her Blood Pressure was very low to the point that we did not think she was not going to make it.   My daughter had so many tubes and IVs going into her poor body during this very difficult time. At one point she had a NG tube ( suction tube ) a NJ tube (feeding tube ) one in each part of her nose ...... as well as a Picc line ( which is a tiny tube that is put in a vein in the upper arm and it runs to the heart so the meds  and any other major fluids she needs gets into her system quicker ) This Picc line was also used to draw any blood that was needed for testing. ( They could not find any veins after the first week )  She also had a drainage tube coming out of her back, 2 IVs one in each hand ( which ended up going bad ) and a foley cath .   
<br /><br />During this very difficult and emotional time I come to realize how much stuff we take for granted. I now live each day as it is my last and or another person(s) last day on this earth. I am grateful for everything I have. This includes everyone on here who have been there for me and those who have prayed for my daughters recovery.  I will post some pictures in the future of my daughter's stay in the hospital. 
<br /><br />THANKS AGAIN TO ALL OF YOU

I have been going through a lot of serious medical problems. In fact Christmas Night I ended up in ER  throwing up blood. I spent the next morning having several test on me. All I know right now is I my blood count is very low as well as my iron level. There is not active bleeds right now but my throat looks like chopped hamburger. I was also told my white count is at high levels, and they told me I have some kind of infection but not sure what or where it is coming from. Then the big kicker  I might have colon cancer.  talk about a crappy Christmas.  So I have decided one thing  I am going to live life one day at a time and spend most of my time with family and friends.  Life is too short even if you are healthy.  Well I need to go time for now  I hope every ones holidays are happy ones.

She received a clean bill of health. Doctor Polly along with a few other doctors around the USA  are now doing a study on what might increase the risk factor for pinched bowel. ( which is what we almost lost Annie too )  They are hoping to decrease the risk of it happening to another person. They are also doing a study with Annie on the improvement different people have before and after the surgery.  So far Annie is the most improved patient in 1 year.

It only became worst as time passed. In Nov. Annie could not eat any type of food without throwing up and getting severe cramping. We took her to the Hospital down in the cities and they ran several test and discovered there is a partial blockage in her Intestines.  If you can remember back when Annie had the surgery done, there is a full blockage in her intestine which almost killed her. We are waiting on the results of the last test done on Thursday , once we here I will let everyone know.

Our family farm was hit by the June 17th tornados. Alot of damage but no one hurt, the lord was looking over the farm.
<br />I was on the Ambulance coming home from a call when one of the tornados hit our ambulance. Let me tell you that is one thing I NEVER want to experience again. It picked up the back on the Ambulance moved us around almost flipped us several times. I dont know what kept us from being picked up all the away and flipped. We were so lucky !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We are still cleaning up rebuilding and recovering from that unforgiving day. 
<br /><br />As for my daughter we have had several up and down moments. the most recent one was yesterday. We have been sent to yet another specialist. She is not getting any better. We know she has had a HX of SMA which you all knew about, as well as a partially paralized stomach. She is still only digesting 20% of the food she eats so her weight stays 100lbs and lower. She is so skinny. I am hoping this next specialist can help us. The other ones have done everything they can do. I hate not knowing what is happening and what is or is not going to happen next.  
<br /><br />Well I have to help my son with his Minnesota book for school. Will try to keep everyone one posted on her as we know.   Here are a few pics on the tornado and damages.
