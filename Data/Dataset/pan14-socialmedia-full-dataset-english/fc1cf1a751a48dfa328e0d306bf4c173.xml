<br />The bartender pours another. The man downs it and says &quot;Another&quot;.
<br /><br />As the bartender pours the third glass he says, &quot;Mister you drink like you have a problem. Want to talk about it?&quot;
<br /><br />The man says, &quot;Ten years, ten years I've been married to my wife, and today I go home a little early to surprise her, and I find my best friend, MY BEST FRIEND, in bed having sex with her.&quot;
<br /><br />The bartender says &quot;Geez, what did you say.&quot;
<br /><br />The man says &quot; I told him, BAD DOG! BAD DOG!&quot;
<br /><br />A lady approaches her priest and tells him &quot;Father, I have a problem. I have two female talking parrots, but they only know how to say one thing.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;What do they say?&quot; the priest inquired.
<br /><br />&quot;They only know how to say, 'Hi, we're prostitutes. Want to have some fun?'&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;That's terrible!&quot; the priest exclaimed, &quot;but I have a solution to your problem. Bring your two female parrots over to my house and I will put them with my two male talking parrots whom I taught to pray and read the bible. My parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase and your female parrots will learn the joys of praise and worship.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Thank you!&quot; the woman responded.
<br /><br />The next day the woman brings her female parrots to the priest's house. His two male parrots are holding the rosary beads and praying in their cage. The lady puts her two female parrots in with the male parrots and the female parrots say &quot;Hi we're prostitutes, want to have some fun?&quot;
<br /><br />One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims, &quot;Put the beads away, brother. Our prayers have been answered!&quot;

<br />&quot;Hello, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;Do you like movies?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he responded, then returned to his book.
<br />Goldie persisted. &quot;Do you like gardening?&quot;
<br />The man again looked up from his book. &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; he said politely before returning to his reading.
<br />Undaunted, Goldie asked. &quot;Do you like pussycats?&quot; With that, the man dropped his book and pounced on Goldie, ravaging her as she'd never been ravaged before.
<br />As the cloud of sand began to settle, Goldie dragged herself to a sitting position and panted, &quot;How did you know that was what I wanted?&quot;
<br />The man thought for a moment and replied, &quot;How did you know my name was Katz?&quot;
<br /><br />There was once an old man and a parrot living all alone together for like 40 years.
<br />One day, the parrot came to the old man and said, &quot;you know, I've never had a woman in my life.&quot;
<br />So the old man, as a favour to his best friend, went to the pet store and talked the owner into letting him use a female parrot for one night for the fee of 40 dollars.
<br />He took the female home, put it into the cage with his parrot, covered the cage and went to bed. He was awoken in the middle of the night to the female parrot screaming she was being killed.
<br />He ran out and pulled the cover off the cage. There he saw his male parrot ripping all the feathers off of the female. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; the old man screamed.
<br />The parrot replied, &quot;Are you kidding, for 40 dollars, I at least want the bitch naked.
<br /><br />A woman answers the door to a market researcher. &quot;Good morning madam, I'm doing some research for Vaseline. Do you use it at all in your household?&quot;
<br />&quot;Oh yes, all the time. It's very good for cuts, grazes and burns.&quot;
<br />&quot;Do you use it for anything else?&quot;
<br />&quot;Like what?&quot;
<br />&quot;Ahem.. err.. well.. during.. ahem.. sex.&quot;
<br />&quot;Oh, of course. Yes, I smear it on the bedroom doorknob to keep my husband out during sex.
<br /><br />This couple had been dating for about six months, but the guy had been afraid to make any sexual advances because of his tiny organ.
<br />Finally one night, he gets up his courage, and takes her to a secluded spot in his car.
<br />While they are kissing, he opens his zipper and guides her hand onto his penis.
<br />&quot;No thanks,&quot; the girl says. &quot;You know I don't smoke.&quot;
<br /><br />A teenager comes home from school and asks her mother &quot;Is it true what Rita just told me? Babies come out of the same place where boys put their dicks?&quot;
<br />&quot;Yes, dear&quot; replies her mother, pleased that the subject had finally come up and she wouldn't have to explain it to her daughter.
<br />&quot;But then when I have a baby,&quot; responded the teenager &quot;won't it knock my teeth out?&quot;

<br /><br />3 When people say &quot;Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too!&quot; Hello! What good is cake if you can't eat it? Who doesn't want to have their cake and eat it? What else am I going to do with my cake? 
<br /><br />4 When people say &quot;it's always the last place you look&quot;. Of course it is. Why would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who are they? Where are they? And Why?? 
<br /><br />5 When people say while watching a film &quot;Did you see that??&quot; No, I paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the floor. Then I miss the next scene for answering the doofus' question! 
<br /><br />6 People who ask &quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot;.... Didn't really give me a choice there, did ya? 
<br /><br />7. When something is 'New and Improved!' Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it, so it couldn't be new. 
<br /><br />8 When people say &quot;Life is short&quot;. What?? Life is the longest thing anyone ever does!! What can you do that's longer? 
<br /><br />9 When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks &quot;Has the bus come yet?&quot; If the bus came would I be standing here? Yeah the bus came but I decided to wait for you!

<br /><br />Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slow down in overall system performance --particularly in the flower and jewellery applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. 
<br /><br />In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5. 
<br /><br />Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. 
<br /><br />What can I do? 
<br /><br />Signed, Desperate 
<br /><br />.................................................................... 
<br /><br />Dear Desperate: 
<br /><br />First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an Operating System. 
<br /><br />Try downloading Tears 6.2 and don't forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewellery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5., at least intermittantly. 
<br /><br />But remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5,Happy Hour 7.0 or Beer 6.1 . 
<br /><br />Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the Snoring Loudly Beta. 
<br /><br />Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 (it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources). 
<br /><br />Also, do not attempt to reinstall the Boyfriend 5.0 program. These are unsupported applications and will crash Husband 1.0. 
<br /><br />In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. 
<br /><br />We recommend Food 3.0 and Hot Lingerie 7.7. 
<br /><br />Best wishes, 
<br /><br />Tech Support

<br /><br />The next day, there's a knock on the door and there stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed in nothing but a pair of  Nike running shoes and a sign around her neck.
<br /><br />She introduces herself as a representative of the weight loss company.
<br />The sign reads, &quot;If you can catch me, you can have me.&quot;
<br /><br />Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles later huffing and puffing, he finally gives up. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is delighted to find he has lost 10 lbs. as promised.
<br /><br />He calls the company and orders their 5-day/20 pound program.
<br /><br />The next day there's a knock at the door and there stands the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his life.
<br />She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign around her neck that reads, &quot;If you catch me you can have me&quot;.
<br /><br />Well, he's out the door after her like a shot. This girl is in excellent shape and he does his best, but no such luck. So for the next four days, the same routine happens with him gradually getting in better and better shape.
<br /><br />Much to his delight on the fifth day when he weighs himself, he discovers that he has lost another 20 lbs. as promised. He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the 7-day/50 pound program.
<br /><br />&quot;Are you sure?&quot; asks the representative on the phone. &quot;This is our most rigorous program.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Absolutely,&quot; he replies, &quot;I haven't felt this good in years.&quot;
<br />The next day there's a knock at the door; and when he opens it he finds a huge muscular guy standing there wearing nothing but pink running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads, &quot;If I catch you, your ass is mine.&quot;
<br /><br />He lost another 65 pounds that week!

<br /><br />It seems that a young couple had just gotten married and spent their first wedding night with the young man's parents. In the morning, his mother got up and prepared a lovely breakfast including freshly cut flowers from her garden and gourmet food. 
<br /><br />She went to the bottom the stairs and called everyone to come down to breakfast. Everyone came down, except the newlyweds. After a long wait, the family ate without them. 
<br /><br />The mother said, &quot;I wonder why they never came down to eat?&quot; 
<br /><br />The groom's young brother said, &quot;Mommy, I think...&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, shut up. I don't want to hear what you think!&quot; said the mother, not wanting to hear any inappropriate comments from the eight-year-old. 
<br /><br />At lunch time, the mother again prepared a wonderful spread and again called the young couple to eat. Five minutes went by and she called again. After another long wait, the family proceeded to eat. 
<br /><br />As she was cleaning the table, mother once again said, &quot;I wonder why they never came down to eat? Once again, the younger brother started to speak, but mother immediately shut him up. 
<br /><br />At dinner the same thing happened. After the meal, mother once again questioned why they had not come down to eat all day. The young lad once again said, &quot;Mommy I think...&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, what is it that you think?&quot; asked the mother rather testily. 
<br /><br />&quot;I think that when my big brother came down to get the Vaseline last night, he got my model airplane glue instead.

<br />Incredibly drunk and walking home they suddenly realized they both needed to pee. They were very near a graveyard and one of them suggested they do their business behind a headstone or something. 
<br />The first woman had nothing to wipe with so she took off her panties, used them and threw them away.
<br />Her friend however was wearing an expensive underwear set and didn't want to ruin hers, but was lucky enough to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. After finishing, they made their way home.
<br />The next day the first woman's husband phones the other husband and said, &quot;These damn girls nights out have got to stop.
<br />My wife came home last night without her panties.&quot; &quot;That's nothing,&quot; said the other. 
<br />&quot;Mine came back with a sympathy card stuck between the cheeks of her butt that said, 'From all of us at the Fire Station, Well never forget you!'

<br /><br />&quot;So, how is everything going?&quot; inquired God. 
<br /><br />&quot;It's all so beautiful&quot; she replied. &quot;Everything is wonderful, but I have just one problem. It's these breasts you've given me. The middle one pushes the other two out and I'm constantly knocking them with my arms.&quot; 
<br /><br />She went on to tell Him that since many other parts of her body came 
<br />in pairs, such as her limbs, eyes, ears, etc.......she felt that having only two breasts might leave her body more &quot;symmetrically balanced,&quot; as she put it. 
<br /><br />&quot;That is a fair point, but it was my first shot at this, you know. I gave the animals six breasts, so I figured that you needed only half of those, but I see that you are right. I will fix it up right away.&quot; 
<br /><br />And He reached down, removed the middle breast and tossed it into the bushes. 
<br /><br />Three weeks passed and God once again visited Eve in the Garden of Eden. 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, Eve, how is my favourite creation?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Just fantastic,&quot; she replied, &quot;But for one oversight on your part. 
<br />You see, all the animals are paired off. The ewe has a ram and the cow has her bull. All the animals have a mate except me. I feel so alone.&quot; 
<br /><br />God thought for a moment and said, &quot;You know, Eve, you are right. How could I have overlooked this? You do need a mate and I will immediately create a man from a part of you. Now let's see............where did I put that useless tit? 
<br /><br />Now doesn't THAT make more sense than that stuff about the rib?

What animal has horns like this?&quot; Still no one guesses. &quot;Let me give you another hint, it's something your
<br />mother calls your father.&quot;
<br /><br />Little Johnny shouts out, &quot;IS IT A HORNY BASTARD?&quot;

<br /><br />These quotes were found in the July 26, 1977 issue of the Toronto News. They are actual statements from insurance forms where car drivers tried to summarize accident details in as few words as possible. Such instances of faulty writing serve to confirm that incompetence can be highly entertaining.
<br /><br />1. Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I don't have.
<br /><br />2. The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intent.
<br /><br />3. I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.
<br /><br />4. In my attempt to kill a fly, I drove into a telephone pole.
<br /><br />5. I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I reached an intersection, a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision and I did not see the other car.
<br /><br />6. I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
<br /><br />7. I was on my way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal joint gave way causing me to have an accident.
<br /><br />8. My car was legally parked as it backed into the other vehicle.
<br /><br />9. As I approached the intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a place where no sign had ever appeared before, making me unable to avoid the accident.
<br /><br />10.I told the police I was not injured, but upon removing my hat, I found that I had a fractured skull.
<br /><br />11.I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the road when I struck him.
<br /><br />12.I saw a slow-moving, sad-faced old gentleman as he bounced off the hood of my car.
<br /><br />13.The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with a big mouth.
<br /><br />14.I was thrown from my car as it left the road, and was later found in a ditch by some stray cows.
<br /><br />15.A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.
<br /><br />16.I thought my window was down, but I found out it was up when I put my head through it.
<br /><br />17.To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front, I struck the pedestrian.
<br /><br />18.The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.
<br /><br />19.The pedestrian had no idea which way to run, so I ran over him.
<br /><br />20.An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.
<br /><br />21.A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.
<br /><br />22.I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law, and headed over the embankment.

<br /><br />Here are some examples:
<br /><br />FREEZER BAGS: They are male, because they hold everything in, but you can see right through them.
<br /><br />PHOTOCOPIERS: These are female, because once turned off, it takes a while to warm them up again.
<br /><br />They are an effective reproductive device if the right buttons are pushed, but can also wreak havoc if you push the wrongbuttons.
<br /><br />TYRES: Tyres are male, because they go bald easily and are often over inflated.
<br /><br />HOT AIR BALLOONS: Also a male object, because to get them to goanywhere, you have to light a fire under their arse.
<br /><br />SPONGES: These are female, because they are soft, squeezable and retain water.
<br /><br />WEB PAGES:Female, because they're constantly being looked at and frequently getting hit on.
<br /><br />TRAINS: Definitely male, because they always use the same old lines for picking up people.
<br /><br />EGG TIMERS: Egg timers are female because, over time, all the weight shifts to the bottom.
<br /><br />HAMMERS: Male, because in the last 5000 years, they've hardly changed at all, and are occasionally handy to have around.
<br /><br />THE REMOTE CONTROL: Female. Ha! You probably thought it wouldbe male, but consider this: It easily gives a man pleasure, he'd be lost without it, and while he doesn't always know which buttons to push, he just keeps trying

Since she had to go to work the next day, she told the repairman, &quot;I'll leave the key under the mat. Fix the dishwasher, leave the bill on the counter, and I'll mail you a cheque.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, by the way don't worry about my bulldog Spike. He won't bother you. But, whatever you do, do NOT, under ANY circumstances, talk to my parrot!&quot; &quot;I REPEAT, DO NOT TALK TO MY PARROT!!!&quot;
<br /><br />When the repairman arrived at Wanda's apartment the following day, he discovered the biggest, meanest looking bulldog he has ever seen. But, just as she had said, the dog just lay there on the carpet watching the repairman go about his work.
<br /><br />The parrot, however, drove him nuts the whole time with his incessant yelling, cursing and name calling. Finally the repairman couldn't contain himself any longer and yelled,
<br /><br />&quot;Shut up, you stupid, ugly bird!&quot;
<br /><br />To which the parrot replied, &quot;Get him, Spike!&quot;
<br /><br />Men just don't listen!

<br /><br />A priest was being honored at his retirement dinner after 25 years in the Parish. A leading Senator and member of the congregation was chosen to make the presentation and give a little speech at the dinner. He was delayed, so the priest decided to say his own few words while they waited.
<br /><br />&quot;I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents, embezzled from his employer, had and affair with his boss's wife; taken illegal drugs, and gave VD to his sister.
<br /><br />I was appalled. But as the days went on I knew that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.&quot;.....
<br /><br />Just as the priest finished his talk, the republican senator arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk. &quot;I'll never forget the first day our parish priest arrived,&quot; said the politician. &quot;In fact, I had the honor of being the first person to go to him for confession.&quot;
<br /><br />Moral: NEVER, NEVER, NEVER BE LATE!
