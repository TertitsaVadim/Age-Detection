<br /><br />Here's how it works:
<br />Statistically speaking, unless you are a total hermit, social retard, or ugly as a bag of spoiled ass...
<br />There's at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you or sleep with you. So..... lets play &quot;friends with benefits&quot;
<br /><br />The rules are simple... if you want to date the person who posted this, send them a msg saying &quot;I'M YOURS&quot;
<br /><br />If you just want to sleep with them and stay friends, send them a message that says &quot;I'D HIT IT&quot;
<br /><br />THE TWIST IS YOU HAVE TO REPOST THIS, EVEN IF YOU'RE TAKEN
<br />&amp; see who replies. There is at least 1 person on your facebox that wants to date you, and maybe more that want to sleep with you.
<br /><br />SO... re-post this as &quot;friends with benefits, anyone?&quot;

<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls &gt;OR TEXTS&lt; you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait
<br />till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/
<br />cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open. Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />let us pay for you!
<br /><br />dont &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and
<br /><br />say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br /><br />Kiss us when no
<br /><br />one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough: if you aren't being treated right by a guy, dont wait for him to change. ditch his sorry, disgrace to the male population ass and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your
<br />lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they're doing just to look you in the eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ..and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repost this
<br /><br />*Holdin Hands
<br />Girls :If you want to hold his hand, gently bump into it a couple of
<br />times.
<br />Guys : Grab it if it happens more than once.
<br /><br />*Cuddling
<br />Girls : When you want to cuddle with him, tell him you're cold 
<br />Guys : Automatically move closer to her.
<br /><br />*Movies
<br />Girls : During a movie, if he puts his arm around you, tilt your head on his shoulder
<br />Guys : Lift her chin up and kiss her.
<br /><br />*Loving each other
<br />Guys : When she tells you she loves you, look deep into her eyes, give her a peck on the lips, and tell her you love her
<br />too... And mean it.
<br /><br />*Laying below the stars
<br />Girls : When you're both laying under the stars, put your head on his chest and close your eyes as you listen to his steady heart beat
<br />Guys : Whisper in her ear and link your hands with hers.
<br /><br />By 12 am tonight your one true love will realize how much they want you.

<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands
<br />I try to pull his hand away;
<br />their grip is strong!
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men?
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why?
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him

<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail

<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he?
<br />If he was still here; would he care
<br />Would he actually even; see?
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot;
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot;
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door
<br />Ever since that night; His friend
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot;
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend
<br />Fade into me like disgrace
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot
<br />They were worried they would get caught
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot;
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot;
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot;
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last
<br />He said I love you so much
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;
<br />I was dead
<br />After only one swing..........................
