<br />and you promised you could walk any distance. 
<br />If it made me smile you said you'd play the fool,
<br />be my ideal lady and always keep your cool.
<br />I lived for you and wanted to always be your friend
<br />How could something so special just end?
<br />Like a soldier my love you've gone AWOL.
<br />All the merry times I shared with you are M.I.A.
<br />Can't you hear me crying out SOS
<br />My love to you was like money and I needed an IOU.
<br />How could you be so unreasonable and unkind?
<br />Can't you see I can't get you out of my mind?
<br />How could I be so love-blind as not to see
<br />that you would sting painfully as a bee.
<br />Don't you have a conscience that pricks at all?
<br />You said you wouldn't dare watch me fall.
<br />I wasn't Samson for your sake so could be my Delilah
<br />You said we would be lovers forever
<br />and I can't seem to believe the fact that it's over.
<br />Come back into my waiting arms my disappearing act
<br />for it's with only you that I ever had a pact.
<br />I don't care how long you've been gone, just come home.

<br />me
<br />A special bond one cannot
<br />see
<br />It wraps us up in its cocoon
<br />And holds us fiercely in its
<br />womb.
<br />Its fingers spread like fine
<br />spun gold
<br />Gently nestling us to the
<br />fold
<br />Like silken thread it holds
<br />us fast
<br />Bonds like this are meant
<br />to last.
<br />And though at times a
<br />thread may break
<br />A new one...... forms in its
<br />wake
<br />To bind us closer and keep
<br />us strong
<br />In a special world, where
<br />we belong.

<br />The living proof that females are the most

<br />and asks, &quot;What is politics?&quot;
<br />Dad says, &quot;Well son, let me try
<br />to explain it this way: I'm the
<br />breadwinner of the family, so
<br />let's call me capitalism. Your
<br />Mom, she's the administrator
<br />of the money, so we'll call her
<br />the Government. We're here
<br />to take care of your needs, so
<br />we'll call you the people. The
<br />nanny, we'll consider her the
<br />Working Class. And your baby
<br />brother, we'll call him the
<br />Future. Now, think about that
<br />and see if that makes sense,&quot;
<br />So the little boy goes off to
<br />bed thinking about what dad
<br />had said. Later that night, he
<br />hears his baby brother crying,
<br />so he gets up to check on him.
<br />He finds that the baby has
<br />severely soiled his diaper. So
<br />the little boy goes to his
<br />parents' room and finds his
<br />mother sound asleep. Not
<br />wanting to wake her, he goes
<br />to the nanny's room. Finding
<br />the door locked, he peeks in
<br />the keyhole and sees his
<br />father in bed with the nanny.
<br />He gives up and goes back to
<br />bed. The next morning, the
<br />little boy says to his father,
<br />&quot;Dad, I think I Understand the
<br />concept of politics now.&quot; The
<br />father says, &quot;Good son, tell me
<br />in your own words what you
<br />think politics is all about.&quot; The
<br />little boy replies, &quot;Well, while
<br />Capitalism is screwing the
<br />Working Class, the
<br />Government is sound asleep,
<br />the People are being ignored
<br />and the Future is in deep
<br />shit.&quot;

<br /><br />They are like the ten
<br />commandments to follow in life
<br /><br />1] Prayer is not a &amp;quot;spare
<br />wheel&amp;quot; that you pull out
<br />when in trouble, but it is a &amp;quot;steering wheel&amp;quot; that directs the right path throughout the journey.
<br />2] So why is a Car's
<br />WINDSHIELD so large &amp;amp; the Rear View Mirror so small?
<br />Because our PAST is not as
<br />important as our FUTURE.
<br />So, Look
<br />Ahead and Move on.
<br />3] Friendship is like a BOOK. It takes a few minutes to burn, but it takes years to write.
<br />4] All things in life are
<br />temporary. If going well, enjoy it, they will not last forever. If going wrong, don't worry, they can't last
<br />long either.
<br />5] Old Friends are Gold!
<br />New Friends are Diamond! If you get a Diamond, don't forget the Gold! Because to
<br />hold a Diamond, you
<br />always need a Base of Gold!
<br />6] Often when we lose hope and think this is the end, GOD smiles from above and says, &amp;quot;Relax, sweetheart,
<br />it's just a bend, not the
<br />end!
<br />7] When GOD solves your problems, you have faith in HIS abilities; when GOD
<br />doesn't solve your problems HE has faith
<br />in your abilities.
<br />8] A blind person asked St. Anthony: &amp;quot;Can there be anything worse than losing eye sight?&amp;quot; He replied: &amp;quot;Yes, losing your vision!&amp;quot;
<br />9] When you pray for
<br />others, God listens to you and blesses them, and sometimes, when you are safe and happy, remember that
<br />someone has prayed for you.
<br />10] WORRYING does not
<br />take away tomorrow's
<br />TROUBLES, it takes away today's PEACE.
<br /><br />If you really enjoyed this,
<br />pass on to others. It may
<br />just brighten someone's day...
<br /><br />Live simply. Love
<br />generously. Care deeply.
<br />Speak kindly. Leave the
<br />rest to God..
