<br />It is barely yet dawn
<br />The road outside is still
<br />No busy traffic with cars yet on it to fill
<br />Soon that not be the case
<br />As many cars there will be going on it at a fast pace
<br />People heading out to their jobs
<br />Weaving in and out of traffic as they bob
<br />Until finally they arrive at their workplace
<br />And all the work there they must face
<br />Ah but for now I will just lay back and enjoy the peace
<br />Compared to later when all the traffic will increase
<br />Even the house seems almost so still and quiet
<br />Such a tranquil feeling I feel yes I like it
<br />Sadly I know this will not long be the norm
<br />As I must face the days challenges like a coming rain storm
<br />But for now I will take this time all in
<br />And let its peacefulness enfold me within
<br />Yes I will relish this as long as I can
<br />See for me this is just the right way to begin
<br />For all what this day has in store for me and then
<br />To be able to go forth and tackle everything there in

<br />with the realization that the next day had come
<br />and we had not yet overcome this uneasy rhythm.
<br />A small voice whispered&quot;perhaps we never would&quot;.
<br />I hushed it and said&quot;not before 10 am and coffee&quot;,
<br />nothing this empty please,but the damage had been done.
<br /><br />I found no rest from the wicked whisper, and the day
<br />just kept growing lighter as i drifted in and out of dreams.
<br />Your face, someone else's voice, reassuring me that at
<br />that same moment, you were dreaming of my face,
<br />and smiling in your sleep.
<br /><br />In this dream i took you,ran my big strong hands
<br />up and down your body,lingering on places you adored,
<br />just because they were yours.
<br /><br />My hand, your thigh.
<br />My mouth, your lower back.
<br />My breath, your belly.
<br />We made love forever.
<br />I know, there is no such thing as forever,
<br />because i woke up, sweaty and wet.
<br /><br />You, i knew, were still under covers asleep.
<br />I wondered if you were dreaming of me,craving me.
<br />It was all i wanted, i thought.
<br />Love me, love me like you have never loved before,
<br />until it burns your skin, makes your mouth water,
<br />until it keeps you up, fills your dreams.
<br /><br />I have woven a poem or two to this effect.
<br />Whispered wanting words to the darkness,
<br />broken by flickering flame.
<br />My voice, your name.
<br />But you seem to have built a labyrinth of walls
<br />at least as strong as i.
<br /><br />My hands bleed from the slow demolition as i climb,
<br />and pull one brick down at a time.
<br />If you are hearing this right now you are thinking,
<br />&quot;Jesus Dave, what more do you want?&quot;
<br />You should know the answer to that.
<br /><br />I only want everything.
<br />I want my cake,and i want you to eat it.
<br />I want the kind of love that makes us hungry.
<br />I want to stay up all night with you, until we're 92,
<br />laughing as we greet another sunrise,
<br />because we can't stop staring into each others eyes.
<br />When we die, i want thereto be enough mystery left
<br />between us that we seek each other out in the afterlife.
<br />I want to believe in the afterlife,
<br />and sometimes the truth is painful.
<br /><br />Maybe there is no God, maybe we aren't meant to be,
<br />but i want you to believe in me.
<br />I want you to give in, i want us to be free.
<br />That, by the way, was the reason i could not call you,
<br />because i too am scared.
<br />Scared that you could walkaway at any moment,
<br />or that i will, if only to beat you to it.
<br />Then we will never know, but we will always wonder.
<br />I know we both have trouble making promises,
<br />but how about just one?
<br /><br /><em>Promise me you wont give up on us,
<br />unless a time comes that we must,
<br />when there is nothing left to dream about.?</em></strong>

<br /><br />Meanwhile, life keeps moving forward. The truth is, there’s no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when?
<br /><br />Your life will always be filled with challenges. It’s best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.
<br /><br />A wise man said, “<em>For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin – real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be got through first, some unfinished invention, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.</em>”</strong>

<br /><br />Proving yourself is a dangerous trap. It takes an enormous amount of energy to be continually pointing out your accomplishments, bragging, or trying to convince others of your worth as a human being. Pride and arrogance actually dilutes the positive feelings you receive from an accomplishment or something you are proud of. To make matters worse, the more you try to prove yourself, the more others will avoid you, talk behind your back about your insecure need to boast, and perhaps even dislike you.
<br /><br />Ironically, however, the less you care about seeking approval, the more approval you seem to get. People are drawn to those with a quiet, inner confidence, people who don’t need to make themselves look good, be “right” all the time, or steal the glory.
<br /><br /><em>Most people love a person who doesn’t need to show-off, a person who shares from his or her heart and not from his or her ego. </em>

This young artist decided to assess his skills. He decided to give his best strokes on the canvass. He took 3 days and painted beautiful scenery.
<br />He wanted people's opinion about his caliber and painting skills.
<br /><br />He put his creation at a busy street-crossing. And just down below a board which read-&quot;Gentlemen, I have painted this piece. Since I'm new to this profession I might have committed some mistakes in my strokes etc. Please put a cross wherever you see a mistake.&quot;
<br /><br />While he came back in the evening to collect his painting he was completely shattered to see that whole canvass was filled with Xs (crosses) and some people had even written their comments on the painting.
<br /><br />Disheartened and broken completely he ran to his master's place and burst into tears. Sobbing and crying he told his master about what happened and showed the pathetic state of his creation which was filled with crosses and correction remarks.
<br /><br />This young artist was breathing heavily and master heard him saying &quot;I'm useless and if this is what I have learnt to paint I'm not worth becoming a painter. People have rejected me completely. I feel like dying&quot;
<br /><br />Master smiled and suggested &quot;My Son, I will prove that you are a great artist and have learnt a flawless painting.&quot; Young disciple couldn't believe it and said &quot;I have lost faith in me and I don't think I am good enough. Don't make false hopes..
<br /><br />&quot;Do as I say without questioning it. It WILL work.&quot; Master interrupted him.
<br /><br />Young artist reluctantly agreed and two days later early morning he presented a replica of his earlier painting to his master. Master took that gracefully and smiled.
<br /><br />&quot;Come with me.&quot; master said.
<br /><br />They reached the same street-square early morning and displayed the same painting exactly at the same place. Now master took out another board which read -&quot;Gentlemen, I have painted this piece. Since I'm new to this profession I might have committed some mistakes in my strokes etc. I have put a box with colors and brushes just below. Please do a favor. If you see a mistake, kindly pick up the brush and correct it.&quot; Master and disciple walked back home.
<br /><br />They both visited the place same evening. Young painter was surprised to see that actually there was not a single correction done so far. Next day again they visited and found painting remained untouched. They say the painting was kept there for a month for no correction came in!
<br /><br />It is easier to criticize, but difficult to improve. If you want to help people improve their behavior it is worth investing your effort in learning how to help people change their behaviors, attitudes and skills. Also, always remember not to get carried away or judge yourself by someone else’s criticism and feel depressed. Take criticism in your stride; consider that which are genuine and implement those which you think is the best to improve you as a person!!

<br /><br />&quot;Oh, what is this Atlantic Ocean?&quot; asked the frog in the well.
<br /><br />&quot;It is a vast body of water,&quot; his friend replied.
<br /><br />&quot;How vast? Is it double the size of this well?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, no, much larger,&quot; his friend replied.
<br /><br />&quot;How much larger? Ten times the size?&quot;
<br /><br />In this way the frog went on calculating. But what was the possibility of his ever understanding the depths and far reaches of the great ocean?
<br /><br />Our faculties, experience, and powers of speculation are always limited. The frog was always thinking in terms relative to his well. He had no power to think otherwise.
<br /><br />Similarly, the scientists are estimating the Absolute Truth, the cause of all causes, with their imperfect senses and minds, and thus they are bound to be bewildered. The essential fault of the so-called scientists is that they have adopted the inductive process to arrive at their conclusions. For example, if a scientist wants to determine whether or not man is mortal by the inductive process, he must study every man to try to discover if some or one of them may be immortal. The scientist says, &quot;I cannot accept the proposition that all men are mortal. There may be some men who are immortal. I have not yet seen every man. Therefore how can I accept that man is mortal?&quot; This is called the inductive process. He may study thousand, two thousand, five thousand, but he cannot study all the men. Therefore his conclusion remains always defective.
<br /><br />And the deductive process means you take the idea from superior person that man is mortal. Your father, your teacher, or your guru says that man is mortal, and you accept it.
<br /><br />If you accept, then your knowledge is perfect.
<br /><br />Therefore inductive process is not always perfect. The deductive process, from the authority, the knowledge received, is always perfect.

If we have no one to serve, sometimes we keep a pet cat or dog and render service to it. All these factors prove that we are constitutionally meant to render service, yet in spite of serving to the best of our ability, we are not satisfied. Nor is the person to whom we are rendering that service satisfied. On the material platform, everyone is frustrated.
<br /><br />The reason for this is that the service being rendered is not properly directed. For example, if we want to render service to a tree, we must water the root. If we pour water on the leaves, branches and twigs, there is little benefit. Similarly if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is served, all other parts and parcels will be automatically satisfied. Consequently all welfare activities as well as service to society, family, and nation are realized by serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br /><br />It is the duty of every human being to understand his constitutional position with God and to act accordingly. If this is possible, then our lives become successful. Sometimes, however, we feel challenging and say, &quot;There is no God,&quot; or &quot;I am God,&quot; or even, &quot;I don't care for God.&quot; But in actuality this challenging spirit will not save us. God is there, and we can see Him at every moment. If we refuse to see God in our life, then He will be present before us as cruel death. If we do not choose to see Him in one feature, we will see Him in another. There are different features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is the original root of the entire cosmic manifestation. In one sense, it is not possible for us to escape Him. </strong>

In fact, the happiest people all have their fair share of low moods, problems, and disappointments. Often the difference between a person who is happy and someone who is unhappy isn’t how often they get low, or even how low they drop, but instead, it’s what they do with their low moods. How do they relate to their feelings?
<br /><br />Most people have it backward. When they are feeling down, they roll up their sleeves and get to work. They take their low moods very seriously and try to figure out and analyze what’s wrong. They try to force themselves out of their low state, which tends to compound the problem rather than solve it.
<br /><br />When you observe peaceful, relaxed people, you find that when they are feeling good, they are very grateful. They understand that both positive and negative feelings come and go, and that there will come a time when they won’t be feeling so good. To happy people, this is okay; it’s the way of things. They accept the inevitability of passing feelings. So, when they are feeling depressed, angry, or stressed out, they relate to these feelings with the same openness and wisdom. Rather than fight their feelings and panic simply because they are feeling bad, they accept their feelings, knowing that this too shall pass.
<br /><br />Rather than stumbling and fighting against their negative feelings, they are graceful in their acceptance of them. This allows them to come gently and gracefully out of negative feeling states into more positive states of mind.
<br /><br />The next time you’re feeling bad, instead of panicking, you can be graceful and calm. Know that if you don’t fight your negative feelings, if you are graceful, they will pass away. </strong>

Similarly, anyone who comes into this material world has to take a material body. This is the law. Unless you have this material body, how can you feel pleasure in material sense enjoyment? It is just like performing on stage: if you are going to play a certain part, you have to dress accordingly. Therefore, this material body is compared to a dress. For example, every lady and gentleman; every one of us; has a different dress.
<br /><br />But our dress is superficial. As human beings we are one. Similarly, each one of us has a different bodily dress, but spiritually we are one. And this is true of all living entities: they are in different bodily dresses only.
<br /><br />The dresses are calculated to total 8,400,000 different forms. In the water there are 900,000 different dresses, and there are 2,000,000 different types of trees and plants. There are 1,100,000 species of insects, 1,000,000 types of birds, 3,000,000 types of beasts, and 400,000 forms of human beings. In this way, the living entity is passing through different dresses.
<br /><br />And the best dress is this human form, because in this dress you can understand what God is, what you are, and what your relationship with God is. Then you can act in that relationship and go back home, back to Godhead. In this human form of dress you have developed consciousness.
<br /><br />But if you miss this opportunity to understand God, then again you will be put into the cycle of the evolutionary process. We should not, therefore, misuse this human form. We should utilize it properly to understand the unlimited God and our relationship with Him, and to act on this knowledge. That is the perfection of life.

This is very unfortunate for many reasons. First, and most obviously, no one really wants to be around someone who is arrogant or self-absorbed. It’s boring, and it’s annoying! Arrogance implies a lack of gratitude. The assumption is, “I did this all by myself; it’s all about me.” 
<br /><br />Factors such as our good karma, Lord’s blessings and so on are forgotten or disregarded.
<br /><br />In addition, when you allow success to go to your head, your stress levels skyrocket and your quality of life gradually disappears. People will stop liking you, and eventually, you’ll stop liking yourself.
<br /><br />Friendships slip away; obsessive busyness and a lack of time take over. Someone who was happy and relatively easy to please is now impossible to satisfy.
<br /><br />There are many celebrities, athletes, and business people who have done really well – their talent, timing, hard work, luck, and all the rest of it kicked in at just the right time. Yet, rather than being grateful and keeping a sense of perspective, they act as if they are somehow better or more important than others simply because they’re good at something and have enjoyed some success.

<br /><br /><strong>One of the most severely limiting beliefs that many of us have is that the person we were yesterday is the person we have to be today. This belief keeps us tied to our past mistakes, habits, and limitations.
<br /><br />We somehow buy into the notion that if we weren’t successful yesterday, we certainly can’t be successful today or tomorrow.
<br /><br />If you can see how ridiculous and self-defeating this belief is, you can make an instant shift toward success. What prevents us from tapping into this potential is our own mental ties to the past. Letting go of your past is like taking a set of heavy chains from around your neck.
<br /><br />Our past has no power other than the power we give it. One of the most dynamic and significant changes you can make in your life is to make the commitment to drop all negative references to your past, to begin living now. The positive energy you create may shock you. New doors and opportunities will open.
<br /><br />As your past habits creep into your consciousness, simply acknowledge them and let them go. Focus on what you can do today, right now in this moment.</strong>

<br /><br /><strong>Name-Changers</strong>
<br /><em>You’re searching for a friend, but they’ve mysteriously disappeared. Were they fed up with you and decided to decontaminate their friend list from your infectious presence? Nope, still there, but for some reason they’ve switched their name from Sarah L to “Ess Smileyface Sillycakes Ell.” These are usually the same people who wonder why they haven’t received a friend request in the past six months. Um, probably because no one can find you! No one got the memo that you switched identities”</em>

<br /><br /><strong>BFFs on Facebook, Strangers in Real Life</strong>
<br /><em>This is just weird – people who talk to you incessantly on Facebook, but either ignore you or are too shy to approach you in real life. They offer their deepest sympathies when you mention that your pet lizard died on FB, but they won’t even look at you when you pass them on the street. Has human communication completely deteriorated?</em>

<br /><br /><strong>Incessant Notifications</strong>
<br /><em>A friend just posted a hilarious picture of themselves that made you giggle. You hit “like” and 20 minutes later, you are bombarded with way too many notifications because people have decided to spark the most interesting conversation about chemistry homework in the photo comments. It becomes extremely annoying as those red flags at the top of your screen pop up like there’s no tomorrow. Keep your comments in the appropriate place, people!</em>

<br /><br /><strong>Chronic Relationships Status Changers</strong>
<br /><em>(Insert name here) is now single. Thirty minutes later, they are in a relationship. Forty-five minutes, “it’s complicated”. Two hours later, they are single again. Really, people who change their relationship status as often as they change their underwear should either pick a status and commit to it or seek medical advice as to why they need to change your underwear so often. After a while, no one takes you seriously. It’s like the boy who cried wolf. If your relationship is really that complicated, how about taking the time to go out and establish a steady one rather than spending your time explaining why “it’s complicated” on Facebook to 564 of your closest friends.</em>

I’m not sure what that means (it’s all so vague) but whatever it is, you have it. I don’t need to explain anything to you or worry if you’ll get the joke. You already got it and are on your way to making the next one. 
<br /><br />We’re best friends because you love me even when I’m terrible. It’s easy to love someone when they’re doing well, it’s easy when there’s nothing but happiness and good vibes. The real challenge comes when everything is crap. You’re not a fun person to be around, people are screening your number and you’re a damn social pariah. But you don’t care.
<br /><br />We’re best friends because I can take you anywhere and you’ll adapt. Whether it’s the chicest party or some insufferable family gathering, you’ll deal with it like a champ. I don’t have to worry about leaving you alone or keeping you entertained. You go do your thing. I do mine. Let’s meet back at the bar in an hour.
<br /><br />We’re best friends because you never make me uncomfortable. I think about most of my friends and realize that they’ve made me feel weird at some point in our friendship. Whether it’s from an awkward silence or an off-color remark, I’ve felt unsure about them. Not you though. I always know that you make sense and that this makes sense.
<br /><br />We’re best friends because we can go for long stretches of time without talking and it won’t damage the relationship. We always pick up where we left off. Surfaces changes mean nothing to us. You could become a vegan who goes by Moonshadow and attends Burning Man, and I would still feel closer to you than anyone else. We don’t need common interests in order to connect. We don’t need a mutual love of music or sports or whatever to keep us together.
<br /><br />We’re best friends because you don’t get resentful or jealous if I get into a relationship or land an amazing job. I mean, maybe you are and that’s fine. The important thing is that you keep it to yourself like a best friend should.
<br /><br />You’re my best friend because you’re not afraid to call me out on my crap or disagree with me. I can’t get away with anything when I’m with you. You’ll tell me things that I need to hear but everyone else is too afraid to tell me. Your honesty is so damn refreshing albeit a bitter pill to swallow sometimes.
<br /><br />We’re best friends because you make feel less alone in this psycho, flaky world. It’s amazing how often you can feel disconnected from people. It’s amazing how many people can betray you, or fail to understand the words that are coming out of your mouth. When I see you, it’s a burst of reassurance that I’m not the only who looks at the world this way. There’s someone else. And that someone is you.</strong>

Almost everyone feels that one of their most valued commodities is their time. This being the case, one of the ultimate slaps and most sure way to annoy someone is to keep them waiting. While most people are somewhat forgiving, keeping them waiting is a sign of disrespect. The subtle message is, “My time is more important than yours.”
<br /><br />Deep down, we all know that no one likes to be kept waiting. Therefore, it’s highly stressful to keep other people waiting because you know you are disappointing someone. In the back of your mind, you know well the person is looking at his watch, wondering why you are late. You may be keeping him from personal or professional commitments and that could make him angry. 
<br /><br />There are obviously exceptions to the rule – times when factors beyond your control prevent you from being on time. Things happen to all of us, and no one has a perfect record. Truthfully, however, a vast majority of the time, being late is preventable by planning ahead, allowing a little extra time, or making allowances for unexpected problems. 
<br /><br />Many times we compound the problem by making excuse like “traffic was horrible,” when, in reality, traffic is virtually always horrible. The problem wasn’t traffic – but the fact that we didn’t factor enough time in our schedule for the traffic. It’s likely the case that, even if traffic was horrible, or you got off to a late start, or whatever the excuse, the other person isn’t going to be interested or impressed. 
<br /><br />I wouldn’t underestimate the negative impact of making someone wait. It drives some people crazy. And, even if they don’t express their frustration to you directly, it can show up in other ways – not taking you seriously, avoiding you when possible, being disrespectful, choosing to spend their time with others instead of you, showing up late to your future appointments, etc.

<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off ......
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there
<br />We don't care if a guy calls or texts you
<br />but at 2 in the morning we do get a ... little ... ... concerned.
<br /><br />Nothing is that important at 2 am
<br />That it can't wait till the morning.
<br /><br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/beautiful/gorgeous/
<br />cute/stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you
<br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br /><br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open
<br />Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />Let us pay for you!
<br />don’t &quot;feel bad&quot;
<br />We enjoy doing it.
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and say &quot;thank you”.
<br /><br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know somebody's
<br />looking, we'll be more impressed.
<br /><br />You don't have to get dressed up for us
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to
<br />wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own. We like you for who you are and not what you are.
<br /><br />It seems that we make mistakes...
<br />I guess that was an attempt at not looking shallow.
<br /><br />Haha... yeah we make mistakes.
<br /><br />Honestly think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's.
<br />or my t-shirt and boxers, not all dolled up.
<br /><br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br /><br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />Don't talk about how hot Chris Brown,
<br />Brad Pitt,or Jesse McCartney is in front of us or any other guy is
<br />It's boring, and we don't care.You have girlfriends for that.
<br /><br />and it pisses us off
<br /><br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br />i'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me
<br />with &quot;Hey handsome!&quot;instead of &quot;Hey baby/stud/cutie/sexy&quot;or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />On the other hand im not sayin i woulndnt like it ether ; )
<br /><br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough:if you aren't being treated right by a guy, dont wait for him to change!!!!!
<br />Ditch his sorry ass, disgrace to the male population
<br />and find someone who will treat you with utter respect
<br />Someone who will honor your morals
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what they're doing just to look you in the eyes.... and say &quot;i love you&quot;, and actually mean it.
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance.
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this. so we hope that all the girls that read this will think on it.

How is his mind so keen, and yet his nature so humble? I wish i knew what brand of ice-cream he ate. If only I could become a little like him.... well, your prayers have been answered. There's this stupid game called tag, which I'm sure originated from the nerd-gang of my electrical class in college. What they do is, they give you this set of questions, which you are supposed to answer (they &quot;tag&quot; you). For example, I was &quot;tagged&quot; by Meera. (I wonder how the nerd-gang got their hands on such a sweet little girl. Meera stay away from them. They can ruin your self-confidence i tell you...). Anyway, enough bullshit. Now for some more bullshit:
<br /><br />1)LAST MOVIE YOU SAW IN A THEATER: Chronicles of Narnia: Prince-Supergay. LOTR for bed-wetters and little girls.
<br /><br />2)WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING?: Functional Specification Document for Geneva Exchange Layer for Forex and Options, Version 1.1.1.5, by my Project manager, one of the greatest writers in the genre of Fixed Income and Treasury. Well actually just finished 3 Mistakes of my life by Chetan Bhagat. No great literary value (The document by my Project manager has more literary value, i tell you), but it was more fun than a barrel full of drunk monkeys.
<br /><br />3)FAVORITE BOARD GAME? : Ludo. I like it because the game is based purely on luck,and hence no one calls you a dumbass after you lose.
<br /><br />4. FAVORITE MAGAZINE? : I've stopped reading them. they only make me fell like a Guy, cos i prefer to be called Duke. Yeah, u get it right, its NOT Dude.
<br /><br />5. FAVORITE SMELLS? : The smell of my girlfriend's (ex-girlfriend :'(, I still miss her) hair right after she's taken a bath. Drives me crazy every time.
<br /><br />6. FAVORITE SOUND? : The sound of the clock striking 6 o'clock on weekdays.
<br /><br />7. WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD? : Well, this Sunday, I was taking a mock CAT, and i forgot the value of Cos30 degrees. I always knew that I was a dumbass, but i didn't know i had reached such heights.
<br /><br />8. WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU WAKE UP?: &quot;Wtf, why didn't the alarm go off?&quot; Well, it always goes off, and it keeps beeping till all my roommates wake up and one of them shuts the alarm, kicks me five times to wake me up, curses my mother and then gives up.
<br /><br />9. FAVORITE FAST FOOD PLACE? :Sudhir Chainis Restorent, just below my office.Their speciality is South Indian.
<br /><br />10. FUTURE CHILD'S NAME? : Well I'll have 3 kids. A boy, and two girls. The boy will grow up to be a rockstar, so I'll give him a name which can be easily anglicized, like Sameer-&gt;Sam,Devraj-&gt;Dave, Omkara Zalaaluddin Zubin Yahudi -&gt;Ozzy. The second girl will be a model, so her name has to sound sexy. Something like Saloni ( have you ever met a girl whose name was Saloni and she wasn't hot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />. The third girl will do all the chores in the house, so I'll name her Bimla.
<br /><br />11. FINISH THIS STATEMENT. &quot;IF I HAD A LOT OF MONEY I’D...? : be 75 years old.
<br /><br />12. DO YOU DRIVE FAST? : I have to. I wake up at 9:20 am, and office starts at 10:00. No choice there.
<br /><br />13. DO YOU SLEEP WITH A STUFFED ANIMAL? : Well, sometimes when my roommate is really drunk, he crashes on my bed and its impossible to move him. So yeah, sometimes i do end up sleeping with stuffed animals.
<br /><br />14. STORMS-COOL OR SCARY? : Storms are always cool. What happens to the roads of Delhi two hours after the storm isn't.
