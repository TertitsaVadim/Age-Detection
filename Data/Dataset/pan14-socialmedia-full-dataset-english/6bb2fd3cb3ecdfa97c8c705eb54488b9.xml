<br />No one knows what it's like 
<br />To be the bad man 
<br />To be the sad man 
<br />Behind blue eyes 
<br /><br />No one knows what it's like 
<br />To be hated 
<br />To be fated 
<br />To telling only lies 
<br /><br />But my dreams 
<br />They aren't as empty 
<br />As my conscience seems to be 
<br /><br />I have hours, only lonely 
<br />My love is vengeance 
<br />That's never free 
<br /><br />No one knows what it's like 
<br />To feel these feelings 
<br />Like I do 
<br />And I blame you 
<br /><br />No one bites back as hard 
<br />On their anger 
<br />None of my pain and woe 
<br />Can show through 
<br /><br />But my dreams 
<br />They aren't as empty 
<br />As my conscience seems to be 
<br /><br />I have hours, only lonely 
<br />My love is vengeance 
<br />That's never free 
<br /><br />When my fist clenches, crack it open 
<br />Before I use it and lose my cool 
<br />When I smile, tell me some bad news 
<br />Before I laugh and act like a fool 
<br /><br />If I swallow anything evil 
<br />Put your finger down my throat 
<br />If I shiver, please give me a blanket 
<br />Keep me warm, let me wear your coat 
<br /><br />No one knows what it's like 
<br />To be the bad man 
<br />To be the sad man 
<br />Behind blue eyes

<br />I’m starring at a broken door 
<br />there’s nothin left here anymore 
<br />my room is cold 
<br />it’s makin me insane 
<br />i’ve been waitin here so long 
<br />but now the moment seems to‘ve come 
<br />i see the dark clouds comin up again 
<br /><br />runnin through the monsoon 
<br />beyond the world 
<br />to the end of time 
<br />where the rain won’t hurt 
<br />fighting the storm 
<br />into the blue 
<br />and when i lose myself 
<br />i’ll think of you 
<br />together we’ll be running somewhere new 
<br />through the monsoon 
<br />just me and you 
<br /><br />a half moon’s fading from my sight 
<br />i see your vision in it’s light 
<br />but now it’s gone and left me so alone 
<br />i know i have to find you now 
<br />can hear your name 
<br />i don’t know how 
<br />why can’t we make this darkness feel like home 
<br /><br />running through the monsoon 
<br />beyond the world 
<br />to the end of time 
<br />where the rain won’t hurt 
<br />fighting the storm 
<br />into the blue 
<br />and when i lose myself 
<br />i’ll think of you 
<br />together we’ll be running somewhere new 
<br />and nothing can hold me back from you 
<br />through the monsoon 
<br /><br />hey! - hey! 
<br />i’m fightin all it’s power 
<br />comin’ in my way 
<br />let it take me straight to you 
<br />i’ll be running night and day 
<br />i’ll be with you soon, just me and you, 
<br />we’ll be there soon, so soon… 
<br /><br />running through the monsoon 
<br />beyond the world 
<br />to the end of time 
<br />where the rain won’t hurt 
<br />fighting the storm 
<br />into the blue 
<br />and when i lose myself 
<br />i’ll think of you 
<br />together we’ll be running somewhere new 
<br />and nothing can hold me back from you 
<br />through the monsoon 
<br />through the monsoon 
<br />just me and you 
<br />through the monsoon 
<br />just me and you

<br />I hold your letter 
<br />In my frozen hand 
<br />The last line was long 
<br />As long as it burns 
<br />My look carries on 
<br /><br />With every word 
<br />Another feeling dies 
<br />I'm left here in the dark 
<br />No memories of you 
<br />I close my eyes 
<br /><br />It's killing me 
<br />We die when love is dead 
<br />It's killing me 
<br />We lost a dream 
<br />We never had 
<br />The world in silence 
<br />Should forever feel alone 
<br />'Cause we are gone 
<br />And we will never overcome 
<br />It's over now 
<br /><br />Vultures are waiting 
<br />For what's left of us 
<br />What can we take 
<br />It all has no worth 
<br />If we lose our trust 
<br /><br />They're coming closer 
<br />Want you and me 
<br />I can feel their claws 
<br />Let me go now 
<br />Try to break free 
<br /><br />It's killing me 
<br />We die when love is dead 
<br />It's killing me 
<br />We lost a dream 
<br />We never had 
<br />The world in silence 
<br />Should forever feel alone 
<br />'Cause we are gone 
<br />And we will never overcome 
<br /><br />It's over now now now 
<br />It's over now now now 
<br />It's over now 
<br />It's over now 
<br /><br />Vultures are waiting 
<br />For what's left of us 
<br />Taking the last of you 
<br />And the last of me 
<br /><br />It's killing me 
<br />We die when love is dead 
<br />It's killing me 
<br />We lost a dream 
<br />We never had 
<br />The world in silence 
<br />Should forever feel alone 
<br />'Cause we are gone 
<br />And we will never overcome 
<br /><br />It's over now now now 
<br />It's over now now now 
<br />It's over now 
<br />It's over now

<br /><br />I, I'm driving black on black 
<br />Just got my license back
<br />I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out 
<br />I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
<br />Your mom don't know that you were missing
<br />She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing Screamin'
<br /><br />[CHORUS]
<br />No, we're never gonna quit
<br />Ain't nothing wrong with it
<br />Just acting like we're animals
<br />No, no matter where we go
<br />'Cause everybody knows
<br />We're just a couple of animals
<br /><br />So come on baby, get in
<br />Get in, just get in
<br />Check out the trouble we're in
<br /><br />You're beside me on the seat
<br />Got your hand between my knees
<br />And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears By now, no doubt that we were heading south I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth 'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch I'm screamin'
<br /><br />[CHORUS]
<br /><br />So come on baby, get in
<br />Get in, just get in
<br />Look at the trouble we're in
<br /><br />We were parked out by the tracks
<br />We're sitting in the back
<br />And we just started getting busy 
<br />When she whispered &quot;what was that?&quot;
<br />The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
<br />And that was when she started screamin' 
<br />&quot;That's my dad outside the car!&quot;
<br />Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
<br />Must have wound up on the floor while 
<br />we were switching our positions
<br />I guess they knew that she was missing
<br />As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing Screamin'
<br /><br />[CHORUS]
<br /><br />So come on baby, get in
<br />We're just a couple of animals
<br />Get in, just get in
<br />Ain't nothing wrong with it
<br />Check out the trouble we're in
<br />Get in, just get in

<br />[Gers / Harris] 
<br /><br />Have you ever felt the future is the past, but you don't know how...? 
<br />A reflected dream of a captured time, is it really now, is it really happening? 
<br /><br />Don't know why I feel this way, have I dreamt this time, this place? 
<br />Something vivid comes again into my mind 
<br />And I think I've seen your face, seen this room, been in this place 
<br />Something vivid comes again into my mind 
<br /><br />All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation 
<br />Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more 
<br /><br />The dream is true, the dream is true 
<br />The dream is true, the dream is true 
<br /><br />Think I've heard your voice before, think I've said these words before 
<br />Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind 
<br />Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality 
<br />Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind 
<br /><br />All my hopes and expectations, looking for an explanation 
<br />Coming to the realization that I can't see for sure 
<br /><br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, please save me from myself 
<br /><br />The dream is true, the dream is true 
<br />The dream is true, the dream is true 
<br /><br />I get up put on the light, dreading the oncoming night 
<br />Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again 
<br />Nothing that I contemplate, nothing that I can compare 
<br />To letting loose the demons deep inside my head 
<br /><br />Dread to think what might be stirring, that my dream is reoccurring 
<br />Got to keep away from drifting, saving me from myself 
<br /><br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br /><br />Lost in a dream of mirrors, lost in a paradox 
<br />Lost and time is spinning, lost a nightmare I retrace 
<br />Lost a hell that I revisit, lost another time and place 
<br />Lost a parallel existence, lost a nightmare I retrace 
<br /><br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br /><br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br />I only dream in black and white, I only dream cause I'm alive 
<br />I only dream in black and white, to save me from myself 
<br /><br />The dream is true, the dream is true 
<br />The dream is true, the dream is true

<br />Grab her ass, actin' tough. Mess with her, she'll fuck you up.
<br />No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned,
<br />but she's comin' back to my place tonight!
<br /><br />She likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
<br />She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
<br />I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
<br />You know what she is, no doubt about it
<br />She's a bad, bad girlfriend!
<br /><br />Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along.
<br />Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home.
<br />No one really knows if she's drunk or is she's stoned
<br />But she's coming back to my place tonight.
<br />I say no one really knows just how far she's gonna go,
<br />But I'm gonna find out later tonight.
<br /><br />She likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
<br />She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
<br />I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
<br />You know what she is, no doubt about it
<br />She's a bad, bad girlfriend!
<br /><br />Doesn't take her long to make things right.
<br />But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
<br />The time of her life...
<br />My girlfriend's a dick magnet.
<br />My girlfriend's gotta have it.
<br /><br />She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger.
<br />Future's finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
<br />I look around and all I see is, no good, bad and ugly.
<br />Man she's hot and fixed to be the future ex-miss Connolly!
<br /><br />She likes to shake her ass she grinds it to the beat
<br />She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
<br />I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end

<br /><br />Honey, why you calling me so late? 
<br />It's kinda hard to talk right now 
<br />Honey why're you crying? Is everything okay? 
<br />I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud 
<br /><br />Well, my girl's in the next room 
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you 
<br />I guess we never really moved on 
<br /><br />It's really good to hear your voice
<br />Saying my name it sounds so sweet 
<br />Coming from the lips of an angel 
<br />Hearing those words, it makes me weak 
<br /><br />And I never wanna say goodbye, 
<br />But girl you make it hard to be faithful 
<br />With the lips of an angel
<br /><br />It's funny that you're calling me tonight 
<br />And yes I've dreamt of you too 
<br />Does she know you're talking to me? Will it start a fight? 
<br />No I don't think she has a clue
<br /><br />Well, my girl's in the next room 
<br />Sometimes I wish she was you

<br /><br />If I had to
<br />I would put myself right beside you
<br />So let me ask
<br />Would you like that? Would you like that?
<br /><br />And I don't mind
<br />If you say this love is the last time
<br />So now I'll ask
<br />Do you like that? Do you like that?
<br /><br />NO!!!
<br /><br />Something's getting in the way
<br />Something's just about to break
<br />I will try to find my place
<br />In the Diary of Jane
<br />So tell me how it should be
<br /><br />Try to find out
<br />What makes you tick
<br />As I lie down
<br />Sore and sick
<br />Do you like that? Do you like that?
<br /><br />There's a fine line
<br />between love and hate and I don't mind
<br />Just let me say that
<br />I like that, I like that
<br /><br />Something's getting in the way
<br />Something's just about to break
<br />I will try to find my place
<br />In the Diary of Jane
<br /><br />As I burn another page
<br />As I look the other way
<br /><br />I still try to find my place
<br />In the Diary of Jane
<br />So tell me how it should be
<br /><br />Desperate, I will crawl
<br />Waiting for so long
<br />No love, there's no love
<br />Die for anyone
<br />What have I become?
<br /><br />Something's getting in the way
<br />Something's just about to break
<br />I will try to find my place
<br />In the Diary of Jane
<br /><br />As I burn another page
<br />As I look the other way
<br /><br />I still try to find my place
<br />In the Diary of Jane
