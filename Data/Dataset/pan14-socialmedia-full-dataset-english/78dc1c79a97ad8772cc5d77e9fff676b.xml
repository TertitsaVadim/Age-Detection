<br />The tropical, cochineal insects were dried and then processed into a coloring product to give that rosy hue to the Frappuchinos, as well as strawberry banana smoothies, raspberry swirl cakes, birthday cake pops, mini doughnuts with pink icing and red velvet whoopee pie.
<br />The insects, often found in a woolly-looking mass that covers prickly pear cactuses in Latin America, are also commonly used to color fabrics and cosmetics. But the pigment they produce is not vegan. It's not kosher. It's also just kind of gross, according to the more than 6,500 Starbucks customers who decided they weren't adventurous enough to stomach the ingredient and signed a Change.org petition decrying the practice.
<br />By the end of June, so-called carmine dye, which experts say can require as many as 70,000 bugs per pound, will be no more at Starbucks. The Seattle company will replace it with a tomato extract called lycopene.
<br />The beetle juice blowup began last month, when an anonymous vegan Starbucks barista emailed the This Dish Is Vegetarian website to disclose that the strawberry sauce used for certain soy drinks contained the bug extract.

<br />The Charlotte, N.C., bank has slashed staff, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>combined business units and dialed back its massive mortgage business. These steps helped the bank post $3.6 billion in operating profit during the first three months of the year — a 40% surge — even as revenue fell 2.5%.
<br />The rebound has delivered a 60% jump in the company's battered stock price this year. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told Wall Street on Tuesday that the bank has squeezed out more profit under a plan to divest businesses, cut costs and clean up its mortgage business.
<br />&quot;We still have work to do, but we're pleased with our progress,&quot; he told analysts during a conference call after reporting first-quarter results.
<br />Moynihan has tried to reinvent the bank as a leaner but more profitable company under a program he calls Project New BAC. The current phase aims to eliminate 30,000 jobs by the end of 2014 and remodel some business lines.
<br />The bank felt the effect of the program during the first quarter — much of it within BofA's mortgage business, which has struggled since its acquisition of Countrywide Financial.
<br />Bank of America's total loan portfolio continued to decline during the quarter. And at its consumer and small-business unit, revenue fell 12% to $7.4 billion while profit dropped 29% to $1.5 billion.
<br />Moynihan has shut down arms of the business that bought loans from smaller mortgage bankers. BofA's volume of originations has dropped from $87 billion in the final quarter of 2010 to $16 billion in its latest quarter, of which 84% were refinancings.
<br />Such a nose dive at a major mortgage lender &quot;has never happened before,&quot; said Paul Muolo, editor of National Mortgage News. &quot;Unless the institution in question failed or was taken over&quot; by the U.S.
<br />After running up tens of billions of dollars in losses, the mortgage business is still running deeply in the red. It lost $1.1 billion in the first quarter this year, down from $2.4 billion a year earlier as the delinquency rate on legacy Countrywide loans eased somewhat.
<br />Also during the quarter, the bank reported improvements in several key areas, including increased capital to guard against future financial shocks and 800,000 new credit card accounts opened during the quarter. Its provision for credit losses fell, its investment banking and trading operations were strong, and its book of loans to larger businesses grew for a fifth straight quarter.
<br />BofA's wealth management business reported a profit of $547 million, its second-best quarter since it acquired Merrill Lynch as the financial crisis erupted in late 2008. The bank added about 200 financial advisors during the quarter, bringing the total to 17,500.
<br />Moynihan also said Thursday that he is pressing ahead with plans to prune BofA's massive branch network by 750 locations. The company, which has the nation's largest branch network, would look to unload locations in less populated parts of the country.
<br />Once the largest U.S. bank, with a dominating presence in the consumer market, Bank of America has slipped to the No. 2 position behind JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
<br />Bank of America is focusing the consumer bank in urban areas, historically an area of strength compared with retail archrival Wells Fargo. BofA said its branch count dipped to 5,651 in the first quarter, down 51. That compares with 5,541 at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and 5,474 at Wells Fargo.
<br />&quot;We're fine-tuning our delivery network&quot; to focus on more affluent customers, Moynihan said.
<br />Critics such as analyst Paul Mayo, author of &quot;Exile on Wall Street,&quot; wonders whether BofA can make such deep cuts to its retail business and workforce without damaging the franchise.
<br />Mayo is also concerned about how it can increase revenue in what remains one of the toughest banking environments since the Great Depression.
<br /> Mayo, a bank analyst at broker Credit Agricola Securities, calls Moynihan's management ineffective. He cites the promise of a dividend increase that the Federal Reserve denied, the bank's still-unresolved liability to claims by mortgage investors, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>and last year's retreat from a woefully received proposal to charge customers $5 a month to make debit-card purchases.
<br />&quot;We have not changed our negative rating on the company,&quot; he said after Thursday's earnings presentation.

But it's not another man — it's another woman. And she's probably your own daughter.
<br />While men tend to maintain a woman<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>as their closest confidant throughout their adult lives, women's focus shifts from their spouse to their adult daughter as they age, according to an analysis of nearly 2 billion cellphone calls and almost half a billion text messages.
<br />The findings, released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports, suggest that women's urge to ensure the survival of their genesmay be connected with the nature of, and shift in, these intimate relationships.
<br />Identifying the most important people in someone's life is a tricky task for researchers, said Ruth Mace, an evolutionary anthropologist at University College London who was not involved in the study.
<br />&quot;It's not politically correct to talk about some of these things,&quot; Mace said. &quot;If I said, 'Were you equally close to your son or your daughter?' you wouldn't want to answer that question.
<br />&quot;But if you're looking at phone calls,&quot; she added, &quot;you're getting a statistical picture that is quite unbiased.&quot;
<br />That's why an international group of researchers obtained electronic communication records from 3.2 million customers of a mobile phone carrier in an unnamed European country. They looked for patterns among 1.95 billion calls and 489 million text messages over a seven-month period, noting the age and gender of the participants. The two contacts each person called and texted most often were deemed to be their first and second &quot;best friends.&quot;
<br />&quot;No. 1 is very easy to distinguish,&quot; said physicist Vasyl Palchykov of the Aalto University School of Science in Finland.
<br />Palchykov and his colleagues from Oxford University in England and Northeastern University in Boston found that in early adulthood, men and women tended to focus most of their attention on a member of the opposite sex — presumably their romantic partner.
<br />Women seemed to focus on their significant others at the age of 18, about four years earlier than men. The intensity of the relationship peaked earlier too — at age 27, as opposed to age 32 for men — and lasted for about 14 years, twice as long as for men, the wireless records indicated.
<br />&quot;Females invest more heavily in opposite-sex relationships,&quot; Palchykov said.
<br />But then, a twist: In their 40s, women's most important relationship began to shift away from the same-aged male to a female about 25 years or so younger — presumably, her adult daughter. The strength of this relationship grew over the next 15 years or so — possibly reflecting the gradual onset of grandchildren — and peaked about age 60.
<br />At the same time, women's second-best-friend slot became increasingly male — probably indicating that the husband had been relegated to second-place status, the researchers said.
<br />Men, on the other hand, appeared to be more stable in their mobile communications, the scientists found. They tended to stick with a female &quot;best friend&quot; — their spouse, presumably — for the duration. And when it came to second-best friends, they were remarkably gender-neutral and didn't appear to have a strong preference for either their sons or daughters.
<br />Though the data were very 21st century, the conclusions are nothing new from an evolutionary standpoint, Mace said. &quot;We also know from traditional populations that men don't get involved in child care so much, so they're not so involved in helping with the grandchild,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't think we've changed that much.&quot;
<br />Mace worked on a study of families in rural Gambia that found that maternal grandmothers — mothers' mothers — played a key role in the survival of their grandchildren. &quot;Grandmothers were materially helping daughters raise grandchildren and actually helping keep them alive,&quot; she said. On the other hand, whether &quot;your grandfather was dead or not didn't make much difference.&quot;
<br />But this doesn't necessarily mean that men's communication lacks a reproductive strategy, she added.
<br /> &quot;Men are capable of reproducing much later in life than females, so you might predict they'd still be more interested in talking to females that they were romantically involved with,&quot; she pointed out. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>

Because the juicy crab and pork buns at Wang Xing Ji — smoking-hot dumplings the size of water balloons, sneakily full of boiling juice — could probably be weaponized.
<br />You could deploy them as grenades, I'm pretty sure, lobbing the heavy spheroids over battlements. Or you could employ them as sub-lethal projectiles, splatting them into the enemy at will, although the sticky broth is undoubtedly prohibited in an obscure codicil of the Geneva Conventions. If you were on the other end of<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a> such an attack you would die happy, with sweet crab and pork juices trickling down your cheek — but you would still die. Does battlefield protocol in such cases include the administering of vinegar and fresh ginger to the fallen along with last rites? I would hope so.
<br />In happier circumstances, you would encounter the juicy crab and pork buns in their natural habitat, the new San Gabriel dumpling house Wang Xing Ji. A single specimen fills out an entire small steamer and must be approached cautiously, as if an undefused bomb.
<br />The first time you run across one of these things, which is a mutantly large xiao long bao, you may try to lift it with a soup spoon, the way you would an ordinary soup dumpling, and it will tear itself apart with its own floppy weight. Or you could preëmptively attack it from above, but you will also fail, and the broth will seep through the steamer's perforations into the saucer strategically positioned below.
<br />If you try to lift it from the top, like LBJ picking up his beagle by the ears, the dumpling will collapse. If you try to work in from the side, the dumpling will collapse. But it is OK to pick up the saucer and lap at the juice like a cat. When it comes to dumplings, shame is an unaffordable luxury.
<br />Wang Xing Ji is the first American branch of a popular dumpling house in Wuxi, a lakeside city about 45 minutes out of Shanghai. Actually, Wang Xing Ji is the dumpling house in Wuxi, almost a century old, the one restaurant every guidebook seems to mention. Wuxi cooking is sometimes considered one of the 14 essential styles of Chinese cooking, although it seems mostly by people from Wuxi.
<br />The dishes are famous for their sweetness — on the menu at the San Gabriel Wang Xing Ji, it is the unsweetened dumplings, of which there are not many, that are marked with cautionary stars. In addition to dumplings, there is wonton, a giveaway bouillon astonishing in its clarity and scallion-tinged purity of flavor, and a really good version of Wuxi spareribs.
<br />To order, you tick off items on a kind of checklist as you might at a fancy dim sum restaurant or the dumpling specialist Din Tai Fung. The menu is a fairly straightforward document, although the way it is structured may lead you to order far more than you can eat: cold slivered pressed tofu and sweet soup with rice balls; complexly smoky cold fish and crab wonton soup; pork belly fried rice and blistery string beans cooked with chiles in a screaming-hot wok.
<br />Specialties are marked with thumbs-up signs. Spicy dishes are marked with chiles. It is interesting to order the regular-size pork dumplings, xiao long bao, in both the unsweetened and sugared versions — the XLB may not be as precisely machined as the ones at Din Tai Fung, but the thicker wrappers are soulful somehow, engineered to absorb just enough black vinegar. The idea of sweet pork may be vaguely repellent, but the traditional XLB wins every time. The sweetness brings out the slight wild flavors of the pork and oniony seasonings; the unsweetened ones seem colorless and bland.
<br />Hand-tossed crispy scallion pancake? You're going to want one (it is crisp as advertised), as well as at least one order of the Salt &amp;amp; Pepper Crispy Cake, which is a pingpong-ball-sized baked dumpling with a pleasantly glutinous filling. The slightly cloddish noodle soups? Maybe not. A smoky glass of plum juice, just the regular kind you can buy in any Chinese supermarket but somehow intensified into a Scotch-like presence by the sweet food, is what you want to drink.
<br />Eventually you will notice the gaily colored boba straw served alongside the monster crab and pork bun, sharpened at the bottom to facilitate puncture, and at once, its purpose will be clear. You will feel slightly foolish, slightly vampiric, but you will sip hot crab juice through a straw, as if it were a milkshake and you were a teenager at Pop's Chocklit Shop. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>It is the only way.

It'll either catapult a combined company to the top of the airline heap or further complicate American's already-messy bankruptcy reorganization.
<br />US Airways made an end run around its larger rival and secured the support of American's three labor unions in its bid to force<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>a merger.
<br />The unions were angry with American over its plan to cut jobs and squeeze labor costs while under bankruptcy court protection. They think they can get kinder treatment from US Airways.
<br />Executives at American's parent, AMR Corp., still control the bankruptcy process. But AMR's grip on its own future just got a little weaker.
<br />All sides have their reasons for what they did Friday:
<br />— The unions want leverage to fight back against American's plan to break their labor contracts. A hearing on the issue starts Monday.
<br />— US Airways, which has been overlooked in other airline mergers, desperately wants to find a partner that will make it much bigger and more competitive.
<br />— AMR wants to avoid outside interference as it tries to use the bankruptcy process to reduce debt and cut labor costs.
<br />US Airways' gambit could take months to play out, and the nation's fifth-biggest airline has not yet made a formal bid for AMR.
<br />But the timing raised eyebrows. The unions announced their support for the US Airways bid just three days before American was scheduled to begin making its case in court that its viability depends on breaking labor contracts with nearly 55,000 pilots, flight attendants and ground workers.
<br />AMR filed for bankruptcy protection in November and has been negotiating for concessions from the unions since February but made little progress.
<br />The outcome of this high-stakes fight could reshape the U.S. airline industry. A merger would produce an airline roughly equal to United Continental Holdings Inc. in revenue and passenger traffic, and slightly bigger than No. 2 Delta Air Lines Inc.
<br />&amp;quot;We have a much smaller market presence than United or Delta, and because of that we're losing a great deal of business travel,&amp;quot; said Scott Shankland, a leader of the Allied Pilots Association at American, in explaining why his group supports US Airways' bid for American. He fears that, left on its own, American will keep shrinking and need fewer pilots.
<br />US Airways didn't detail terms of its agreements with American's unions. But it promised to save about 6,200 AMR jobs headed for elimination and to call the combined company American Airlines and base it in AMR's hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.
<br />Consumers could be left with one less choice in travel. They've already seen familiar names disappear — Continental, Northwest, TWA, soon AirTran. That consolidation has helped the industry return to profitability, but it also has led to higher fares as airlines limit the number of flights.
<br />Jamie Baker, an airline analyst for J.P. Morgan, estimated that combining US Airways and American would leave the four largest airlines, including Southwest, in control of close to 90 percent of the U.S. air travel market. In 2005, the top three plus Southwest controlled roughly half the market, he said.
<br />Each of the players in Friday's drama<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> has different goals and different levers to achieve what it wants:

<br />This dramatic reversal of fortune is why Argentina, already a global financial rogue after its historic debt default, is willing to risk becoming even more of a pariah by seizing control of its leading oil company from Spanish hands, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>analysts say.
<br />President Cristina Fernandez infuriated Spain, its largest foreign investor, but elated many Argentines by expropriating Repsol YPF SA's majority stake in Argentina's formerly state-owned YPF energy company.
<br />Only two months earlier, Repsol YPF had upped its estimate for the shale oil and gas it found in Argentina to nearly 23 billion barrels, enough to double the country's output in a decade. But the Spanish company said it would cost $25 billion a year to develop, and warned that Argentina would need to overhaul its energy policy to attract the necessary investment.
<br />Instead, Fernandez simply seized the company, giving her government access to billions of dollars' worth of cash, enough energy to answer domestic demand in the short term, and potentially even solving Argentina's chronic money woes in the future.
<br />She accused Repsol of draining YPF since gaining control in the 1990s, underinvesting in its oil and gas fields and failing to keep pace with the needs of Argentina's growing economy even as it paid huge dividends to shareholders.
<br />Repsol blames Argentina's ever-changing mix of subsidies, price caps and export taxes for depressing production as the country's demand for energy soared since 2003, when her husband, President Nestor Kirchner, came to power.
<br />Both are partly right, says Eduardo Fernandez, an independent consultant and former fuels director in Argentina's energy ministry.
<br />The problem was a government approved practice of allowing Repsol to use profits to pay shareholder dividends rather than invest that money in the company's future. &quot;That led to a lack of reinvestment in utilities, little exploration and dwindling reserves, as oil fields dried up and productivity fell,&quot; Fernandez said.
<br />Argentine oil production plunged 22 percent from 2000 to 2010, even as demand surged more than 40 percent, according to data from the Argentine Oil and Gas Institute and the Energy Ministry compiled by a former energy secretary, Emilio Apud.
<br />Argentina's production has fallen so<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> low that the government now spends billions of dollars a year on expensive imported fuels that it provides at a loss to companies and consumers.

<br /><br />“Oh, the weather? It is going to be <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>perfect today. Just the way I like it.” Mulla said with great confidence.
<br /><br />The neighbor, somewhat surprised at the response, said, “How can you be so sure?”
<br /><br />“Well, it is very simple. I have learned to love whatever type of weather I get for I have no control over it,” Mulla added, “but staying positive helps me feel motivated all day.”
<br /><br />Motivation — often, many struggle to stay motivated right till the end. It can be the difference between winning and losing, between victory and defeat, between success and failure. Motivation is an attitude, it is a habit. It can be cultivated, nurtured, boosted and instilled like all other habits. Here is how:
<br /><br />1. Be Positive: If you are positive you will stay motivated naturally. Everyone has their own unique way of staying positive. You need to have a little bit of self-dialogue, self-reflection to see how you can stay positive. A good way to do so is to look at the benefits of achieving your goal, to find a way to enjoy your journey. Imagine being stuck in the traffic on a highway, it is beyond your control. At that moment, you have the choice to be positive and listen to some nice music or call your friends and family (with the hands free kit on) and so forth. Or, you can be crossed and fried with all the commuters, with the roads and traffic department, with the lanes that appear to be moving faster than your own, with those who are cutting in and on and on. Being positive, however hard it may sound, is a matter of choice, a question of habit. If you decide to stay positive no one can stop you.
<br /><br />2. Be Disciplined: Being disciplined is, in a way, even more important than being positive. If you are disciplined, you will get the results. And as you see results, you will automatically feel more motivated. When you decide to do something, just get on with it. It is not always about liking or disliking. Let us say, you are trying to lose weight. Whether you have decided to shed five pounds or fifty is immaterial. If you follow the discipline in your diet, in your exercise, results will show through. Day in, day out, if you eat right, hit the tread mill, burn calories, tone yourself up, you will achieve your goal of losing weight. But it is not going to happen overnight. And, that leads to my final third point.
<br /><br />3. Be Patient: Motivation gets killed when we lose patience. If you stay course, steadily working towards your goals, you will certainly see the results. Let me go back to the example of losing weight. Let us assume you are thirty years old. It has taken you thirty years to gain this weight. And, do you expect to lose it in three days, or three weeks or even three months? Surely, you will start to see results in a matter of weeks but if you want to lose weight the healthy way, the natural way, it is going to take a little longer. When you have to do something because you have decided it, do not let your heart dictate, let your mind lead. Do not think about the whole one hour you have to spend at the gym, just take it a minute at a time.
<br /><br />Whenever you feel restless, remind yourself to be patient. Whenever you feel like skipping, remind yourself to be disciplined. Whenever you feel low, remind yourself that it is not about feeling good or bad, low or high that you just <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>have to do it. Actions bring results.
<br /><br />As they say, if you want to be happy, be positive and be motivated, do what you love or start loving what you have to do.

<br />For those who still think the Artest formerly known as Ron delivered an elbow unintentionally to the head of Oklahoma City’s James Harden, go back to the video from Sunday’s <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>game against the Lakers, then to the dozen or so previous incidents that made MWP the most suspended player in the NBA during the past 15 years. To those who say he’s reformed, remember it was only a matter of weeks last season between the time he picked up the pro basketball writers’ citizenship award and laid out J.J. Barea in the playoffs with a clothes-line hit.
<br />There’s no reforming the guy, because unlike Dennis Rodman, whose number he wore for a while in tribute, MWP isn’t playing a character. After years of counseling, he still has precious little impulse control and even less of an idea when his demons are about to grab the upper hand. Teammates love MWP when he arrives, sincere, funny and bursting with energy — until one day he’s not. Then he shows up for practice in a bathrobe, or gets into shouting matches or fights with teammates, rivals or opposing coaches. Then the guys who play alongside him have to pretend it wasn’t Artest’s fault, all the while muttering under their breath how lucky they were to be somewhere else on the court when he went off.
<br />Unless, of course, you’re Andrew Bynum, who’s already thrown the occasional Artest-like tantrum and would no doubt scribble a touching tribute to his running pal on the side of his sneakers for as long as MWP is suspended.
<br />If I’m commissioner David Stern, the deliberations would have been over long before now. The point is not simply to send a message, it’s about protecting the other players. Besides, trying to teach MWP a lesson didn’t work the first dozen times, and anything less than a suspension through the playoffs — into next season, if need be — is to invite the same kind of stupid risk-taking the NHL encouraged early in its postseason. However, it appears hockey has effectively tamped down by suspending serial cheap-shot artist Raffi Torres of the Coyotes for 25 games following a hit to the head of Chicago’s Marian Hossa.
<br />Like MWP’s blow to Harden’s head, that hit had nothing to do with the run of play. It wasn’t designed to accomplish anything but injure an opponent. Before NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan levied the punishment, his responses to a wide range of infractions left players not just scratching their heads, but wondering what they could get away with. There was no clear logic to the nearly dozen penalties handed out — whether the discipline was matched to the seriousness of the intent or the resulting injury — but every player understood that 25 games meant Torres won’t be back this year unless Phoenix plays 7 games in every series through the end of the Stanley Cup. Suddenly, everybody on the ice was a lot more mellow, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a>or at the very least a lot less reckless.

We know people often overlook the eyes when thinking of health and fitness but some simple measures <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a>could prevent major visual disorders. This could be as simple as eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and avoiding certain risk factors (like smoking). In other words, this is not rocket science, it's the same mantra for overall health that has been with us for decades.
<br />For US citizens over the age of 40 disorders to the eyes such as cataract, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), dry eye-syndrome (DES), and<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhZ2xhc3Nlc3N0b3JlLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carreraglassesstore.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.carreraglassesstore.com</a></a> glaucoma—cost approximately $36 billion annually. ARMD is the leading cause of blindness in people 55 and older and as many as 20% of the population suffer from DES. As always, Can-C.biz are as keen as ever to express our mantra -prevention is better than cure and couple with protection it is possible to preserve vision for a lifetime.
<br />The eyes are directly attached to the brain and as you would hope from the organ responsible for vision, they are hardy. As with other organs in the body, protection against the ravages of free radicals is imperative for good eye health. This is also the case for supporting healthy blood vessels and circulation. The eyes are in the front line for direct damage caused by every day <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>factors such as pollution, radiation, sun exposure and smoking along with factors such as being obese, drinking too much alcohol and a poor nutrient intake. This group of factors all cause free radical damage throughout the entire body including the eyes. Free radicals can contribute to the onset of vision problems such as cataracts, glaucoma and ARMD. Free radical damage to the delicate, vulnerable retinal tissue is permanent and cumulative over a lifetime.
<br />Can-C eye drops contain a super anti-oxidant <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>&gt;which is delivered directly into the part of the eye that has been subjected to free radical abuse. They mop up free radicals and work on the 'trash' left behind in order to give the eye the best environment for optimal health. Once the trash is out the way, the eye begins to heal itself. Can-C eye drops ideally would be used to prevent the onset of aging eye disorders along with more obvious preventive measures like wearing sunglasses, avoiding cigarette smoke and pollution, staying fit and reducing weight if you are obese, limiting alcohol intake and eating a healthy diet.
<br />Eating a healthy diet packed full of antioxidants and essential fatty acids is a great way to look after your eyes. There has been much research into the benefits of both and it is evident a diet rich in antioxidants and fish oils is important for eye health. Those who do not eat these foods on a daily basis should <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>consider supplementation. Taking vitamin C, vitamin E, lipoic acid, N-acetyl cysteine and other antioxidants can protect cells from free radical damage. DHA from fish oil accounts for approximately 30 to 35% of the total fatty acids found within the eye. DHA is vital for the development, function and maintenance of the ocular cells.
<br />Important note: Supplementing with lutein and zeaxanthin can help protect the retina from damaging exposure from sunlight BUT if using Can-C eye drops it is not advisable to because they could negate the important effect of the drops. Ingesting natural sources of lutein and zeaxanthin is absolutely fine. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww..michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www..michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

<br />The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government shelling of the central city of Hama killed at least 12 people on Wednesday. Activists say Syrian troops also shelled the Damascus suburb of Douma, while suspected government snipers in the district killed two people. Elsewhere, the Observatory says Syrian<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>rebels killed three government soldiers in a battle in the southern province of Daraa. 
<br />Casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. 
<br />Four more observers joined the unarmed U.N. team trying to monitor the shaky cease-fire in Syria's year-long conflict, expanding it to 15 personnel. Activists say several of them visited Douma on Wednesday, while two remained in Hama and two others kept a base in the nearby city of Homs. All three areas have been centers of the 13-month uprising against autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the U.N.-backed truce that took effect on April 12 has been &quot;seriously compromised&quot; by recent violence. He called on the United Nations to significantly expand the observer team in Syria in the next 15 days to the full contingent of 300 personnel authorized by the Security Council. 
<br />Juppe also said international envoy Kofi Annan's next report on cease-fire compliance to be presented to the Security Council on May 5 will be a &quot;moment of truth.&quot; Speaking after meeting Syrian opposition figures in Paris, Juppe said that if the Syrian government keeps defying the truce, France will seek to punishDamascus by drafting a &quot;Chapter Seven&quot; Security Council resolution that could be enforced militarily. 
<br />Russia and China have twice vetoed Western and Arab-backed Security Council resolutions calling for punitive action against Mr. Assad's government for violently suppressing the revolt. 
<br />The Syrian government says it is committed to the cease-fire and other elements of Mr. Annan's peace plan, but reserves the right to defend itself against &quot;armed terrorists&quot; whom it accuses of driving the unrest. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww..michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www..michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

		<document id="e54e8f8285a04fb28efd0b463f56dc2" url=""><![CDATA[Finding My Happiness<br/><br/>The past decade has been about transforming my life.  In my late twenties I finally decided to quit smoking.  I replaced cigarettes initially with<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> carrera sunglasses </a> things like Starbursts and Now ‘n Laters, any kind of hard candy I could throw in my mouth and pretend I didn’t want to smoke.  Finally I weaned myself off of most of the candy (the cigarettes were stopped immediately) but I never said no to food.  At home I tried to make good food, not necessarily food that was good for you.  I ate out at restaurants a lot and there were many nights of take out, mostly bad choices from the menu.  Suddenly before I knew it, I had gained a ton of weight.  Even though my size kept going up I didn’t realize it.  I was just walking through my life and not paying any attention.
<br /><br />It did hit me when I could no longer fit into regular sized clothes and had to shop at a plus size store.  I was so humiliated having to shop there that my face would turn red when I approached the storefront.  Also at this time I started having pain in my feet and went to a podiatrist.  He determined that the pain was the result of the weight and while there were things I could do to ease it on a daily basis, I really just had to reduce my weight to feel better.  My body had become so big that my feet couldn’t handle the weight anymore.
<br /><br />I spent years trying to get the weight off.  I joined Weight Watchers and the Y.  I later signed up for an early morning boot camp.  I would head out in the dark to an elementary school parking lot where a trainer would lead us through an hour of cardio, weight training, and stretching.  I got some of the weight off and even toned up a little.  But I still had a long way to go to get back to a healthy weight.  My life was out of balance and I was unhappy.
<br /><br />I decided to make a big change and left New England, a high paying job, and my family to work at a guest ranch in Jackson, WY.  This was the best decision of my life.  It was in the west that my life became in balance and my health began to improve.   I was happy living on the ranch, being outdoors and around horses, and away from the stressful life I was living.  I came to terms with the idea that not everyone is meant to work in corporate America and live in suburbia.  That living a lifestyle that made you happy was more important than living a lifestyle that brought you money.  In my second season at the ranch I fell in love, something I hadn’t experienced for a long time.  Once my life started to become in balance I was open to more things and I was happier and this allowed me to be able to fall in love.
<br /><br />The following winter I moved to Telluride, Colorado and started living an incredibly active lifestyle. I learned to snowboard, ski, and mountain bike when I moved to Telluride.  I overcame the plateau I was stuck on and lost about twenty more pounds and went down two dress sizes (about 80 pounds over the course of this journey).  Every day is an opportunity to get outside and be active, even in the snow!
<br /><br />I have always felt a calling to help people in my life.  I have spent many years volunteering for various organizations and that helped me fill that need.  But I always knew I was meant to do more.  One night while watching The Biggest Loser I decided that I wanted to help people transform their health.  I knew I didn’t want to be a trainer but I didn’t know what to pursue.  I immediately emailed my old trainer in CT and she<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJyZXJhLWdsYXNzZXMuY29t" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carrera-glasses.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.carrera-glasses.com</a></a>suggested I look into Health Coaching and the Institute for Integrative Nutrition.  After perusing their website and attending an information session I knew this was the right school for me.

		<document id="608328c21a9c2ab8a2598a7f8468eadf" url=""><![CDATA[The 8 Steps to Becoming Successful<br/><br/>Success is an interesting concept, one I have studied for many years while working with some very successful people.
<br /><br />While watching these people I have seen that their success always followed the same, general, path. I have broken that path down into 8<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>simple steps that you can follow and make your success a reality.
<br /><br />1. Goal Setting
<br />If you have read my blog or the articles I have written here on pick the brain you can see that I discuss goal setting a lot. It is because I don’t think you can succeed if you haven’t decided what you consider success, first.
<br /><br />You need to have a target to aim for, you need to know why you are working.
<br /><br />2. Planning
<br />Without a roadmap success is impossible. Many studies have been made to why some entrepreneurs succeed while others don’t. In most cases, it all comes down to planning.
<br /><br />Successful entrepreneurs have made complete<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> plans for how they are going to succeed and what they plan on doing. Often they end up doing something completely different, but the act of planning moves you to a long term mindset and it gives you a frame of reference when you evaluate opportunities and something to update when it is time to change.
<br /><br />3. Acting
<br />A perfect plan cannot do anything until acted on. All the successful people I have worked with have developed the habit of acting. When they get an idea they take action at once.
<br /><br />When they see an opportunity they don’t wait until tomorrow, they act. Once you have completed your plan, act on it.
<br /><br />4. Fail/learn
<br />Every successful person I have met have failed at least once, by failed I don’t mean you have to go bankrupt, but at least once their plans didn’t go as they thought. They didn’t know everything before they started. There were things they needed to learn. 
<br /><br />When you start towards your<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>success you will hit at least one bump on the road, learn from it, learn how to avoid it and then get back on the horse.
<br /><br />5. Planning
<br />With the new lesson you have learned you will need to update your plan, it might not be any major changes but you will need to do something. You will need to make some adjustments so that you take the quickest way towards your goals.
<br /><br />6. Acting
<br />Strangely this is the most common part people miss. They try once, they fail, they make new plans and then they stop. They don’t have the courage to try again.
<br /><br />It feels almost ridiculous when you see the steps one after another, taking action on the plan you just made should be obvious, but everyone doesn’t do it.
<br /><br />Your chances of success are infinitely higher now that you have failed once, use the knowledge you have paid for and succeed. If you do you will be one of the chosen few who live their dreams.
<br /><br />7. Learning
<br />After going through the first crushing setback you learn a lot, but as you continue and get nearer and nearer your success you will see that you constantly need to learn more. Successful people seek out knowledge and never believe that they know everything. They continue improving themselves all the time.
<br /><br />8. Succeeding
<br />After your struggles are complete and you have learned enough you will succeed. This step is mostly about recognizing it. Once you have succeeded make sure to take pleasure in it, don’t blindly continue working and toiling. Live your dream life,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3d21pY2hhZWxrb3JzaGFuZGJhZ3NvdXRsZXR3ZWIuY29t" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>the one you have deserved.
<br /><br />I hope you liked this article and found it useful.

<br />A previously unknown mutation discovered in a common roundworm holds the promise of new treatments for obesity <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>in humans, McGill University researchers say. Their study was published Dec. 3 in the journal Nature, and was funded by the Canadian Cancer Society and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
<br />In lean times, a normal Caenorhabditis elegans worm goes into a form of suspended animation called &quot;dauer&quot; that slows its metabolism and allows it to survive for extended periods without food.
<br />&quot;When they go into dauer, these worms radically alter their metabolism,&quot; said Dr. Richard Roy, a cancer researcher at McGill's Department of Biology specializing in the control of cell division. &quot;They <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>shut down everything energy-consuming, which includes foraging, cell division and reproduction.&quot;
<br />Unlike other &quot;hibernating&quot; organisms, C. elegans maintains a degree of mobility during dauer by stocking up on energy in the form of fats – or lipids – which they store in special cells or reserves.
<br />&quot;This allows them to live up to six months without eating, instead of the two weeks they would otherwise have,&quot; Roy explained. A worm with the newly discovered mutation, however, will usually die within a week of going into dauer
<br />&quot;These mutants somehow cannot shut down the process of cell division, which is why we noticed them in the first place,&quot; Roy said. &quot;However, that's not what kills them. They cannot adjust their metabolism correctly. They store up their six-month lipid reserves, but as soon as they <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>shift into dauer they use them up within a few days. This is because they lack an enzyme that blocks the activity of a very important triglyceride lipase. Without this regulation the lipase burns up all the fat it encounters and destroys the worm's energy reserves.&quot;
<br />This discovery was a near-accidental by-product of Roy's regular line of research, searching for cells that abnormally disobey cellular signals in a cancer context, and he gives graduate student and study first author Patrick Narbonne much of the credit.
<br />&quot;Patrick was absolutely brilliant. He was so observant that he noticed these animals were dying way too early, and he also realized that they were not dying because of the cell-division issue.&quot;
<br />Roy and Narbonne believe this discovery, which will require considerable additional research, may have significant long-term implications for human health.
<br />&quot;I think we should start looking at the enzymes involved in this cascade, particularly in obese individuals. They are likewise accumulating lipids, but in a reverse situation to C. elegans, this enzyme isn't recognizing it, or something is blocking its function. We're making the case that we can uncouple this enzyme from its normal regulation. If we could develop drugs to do that selectively in fatty tissue, we'd be able to chew up all the fat.&quot;
<br />&quot;This study fascinates me,&quot; said Dr. Robert Sladek, one of Canada's most prominent diabetes researchers, affiliated to the McGill Department of Human Genetics and the McGill and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. &quot;It will be exciting to see whether this pathway that controls energy storage and lifespan in worms plays a similar role in humans. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>The implications for patients with obesity and diabetes might be quite far-reaching.&quot;

<br />New research, published in the journal Cell Metabolism, suggests the fat responsible for producing the pear shape flaunted by <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce may be active in protecting women from diseases by releasing certain hormones. 
<br />Buttock and hip fat may protect women against type 2 diabetes, from which more than 1.7 million Australians now suffer, researchers from the Harvard Medical School  found. 
<br />When buttocks and hip fat from mice was injected into other mice, their bodies easily used the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin and lost weight.
<br />They were also able to make better use <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>of insulin, the main hormone linked to diabetes.
<br />It has long been known by scientists that types of fat can affect a person's health.
<br />People with the apple shape, where fat is stored around the tummy, can be more prone to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Those with pear-shaped bodies, where fat is collected in the buttocks, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>are less likely to have these disorders. 
<br />Researcher Dr Ronald Kahn insisted that not all fat was bad for health.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;The surprising thing was that it wasn't where the fat was located, it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable,&amp;amp;quot; he said.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;Even more surprising, it wasn't that abdominal fat was exerting negative effects but that subcutaneous fat was producing a good effect.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;I think it's an important result because not only does it say that not all fat is bad, but I think it points to a special aspect of fat where we need to do more research.&amp;amp;quot;
<br />Scientists also monitored the health of the mice given the fat transplants. When it was inserted into the tummy area, the mice lost weight and their fat cells shrank. The researchers will now try to identify the hormones.
<br />&amp;amp;quot;If we can capture those (substances) we might have an opportunity to convert them into drugs or use them as guides to<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>help develop drugs,&amp;amp;quot; Dr Kahn said.
<br />By 2031 it is estimated that 3.3 million Australians will have type 2 diabetes. At least seven million are overweight or obese, costing the health system $8 billion a year.

Considering the huge price associated with these pills, would it make sense to do so? And for whom?
<br />The drug tenofovir-emtricitabine (sold as Truvada) costs $26 a day to take, which adds up mighty quickly, but if taken correctly, it can mean a 73% drop in risk of acquiring HIV. And according to a new study out of Stanford, forking out almost $10,000 a year for this prescription could make sense — but only for a very specific sub-section of the population: high-risk gay men.
<br />According to the study, men who have sex with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>men are still at the highest risk of HIV infection, and account for more than half of the 56,000 new cases that arrive annually. Getting the entire American population of gay/bi sexually-active men on the pill would cost a truly stupefying amount, $495 billion over 20 years. However, with a few caveats in play, the researchers think there's a way to have this make financial sense.
<br />For one, they suggest that only at-risk men engage in pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP — those who have five or more sexual partners a year. If 20% of those people took the pill, that would lead to a drop of 41,000 cases<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>for a cost of $16.6 billion. That's a bill of $1,185,714.29 per case, which seems still rather a lot of money, but apparently amounts to &quot;$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained (a measure of how long people live and their quality of life)&quot;
<br />But this doesn't really seem to answer a great many of questions that have been raised. PrEP has been studied extensively, and previous economic analyses have given it a higher pricetag — which this study avoided by limiting it to 20 years of pill taking. It also doesn't answer who would pay for this, since $10,000 a year is a huge financial burden for something prophylactic — and I'd be curious if an insurance company would crunch those numbers in the same way and consider it financially feasible.
<br />You also have to wonder if there aren't other population groups who might also be interested in this. Sex workers, perhaps? Doctors who work in clinics with at risk populations, who are constantly terrified of being accidentally stuck with a surgical needle? And how does it compare to post-exposure prophylaxis?
<br />But by far the biggest elephant in the room is that you're asking a significant body of people to use a drug with potent side effects for a major part of their adult lives, one which causes kidney problems and a laundry list of other issues. Not to mention the places where these drugs would really be needed — sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia — are the same that would have the most trouble in paying that amount.
<br />With the announcement of the report, the drug's maker Gilead Sciences Inc., has already filed a supplemental new drug application<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>to market it for prevention purposes

<br />The idea is that improvements in public health would decrease obesity-related health and economic costs (estimated at $100 billion per year) and would position Americans to become more economically competitive, say the authors of the paper, Dr. David Ludwig, of Children's Hospital Boston, and Harold Pollack, of the University of Chicago's Center for Health Administration Studies. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>In the absence of such action, they say, obesity and public health are likely to worsen.
<br /> &quot;The economic downturn can be expected to reduce nutrition quality and physical activity, worsening obesity prevalence when society is least able to bear the escalating financial burden,&quot; they wrote.
<br />In times of economic stress, consumers tend to eat less costly, high-calorie products, they say. Membership in gyms, fitness classes and sports leagues declines. Some schools may even cut physical education time. The economic stimulus plan, however, could create jobs and invest in the nation's health through such projects as building school kitchens to cook nutritious food; building <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>sidewalks, bike paths, parks, sports facilities and community health centers; and changing government policies to revitalize farming.
<br />Today's Los Angeles Times story on the stimulus plan debate notes that Senate Republicans object to a $75-million measure in the package that would help people quit smoking. That doesn't bode well for other public-health enhancements to the bill. But you can't blame health experts for trying. Here's how Ludwig and Pollack put it:
<br />    &quot;Does U.S. society wish to produce vast amounts of low-quality food, neglect the social infrastructure to support physical activity, and sustain the inevitable economic and social harms of obesity-related diseases? Or will this opportunity to align economic and social policies with the interests of public health be seized by implementing a comprehensive, national obesity strategy? Failure to act now <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>could ultimately cost society much more than even the sub-prime mortgage crisis.&quot;

If you find water too plain for drinking, herbal tea is a good substitute. Be sure to drink at least five cups everyday to enjoy all the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>health benefits. There are many health benefits for drinking herbal tea but here are top seven reasons why you should drink them:
<br />1. To Lose Weight
<br /><br />Losing weight through herbal teas is a very popular topic. The reason why teas can help weight loss is mainly because they can increase your body metabolism and thus improve your cardiovascular system, blood circulation and ultimately lower your cholesterol level. In green tea there is something called antioxidant catechins and studies have shown that they help to burn fat.
<br />2. Prevent Cancer
<br /><br />Did you know that the Japanese people who drink teas are less prone to lung cancer? Believe it or not, herbal tea can cure heart ailments, stroke and even prevent certain cancers!
<br /><br />3. Cure Stomach Disorder
<br /><br />If you're suffering from stomach disorder, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a> try drinking a cup of herbal tea after you finished eating your meal. Herbal tea can help your stomach digest the food easily by reducing the acids.
<br />4. Better Immune System.
<br />Herbal teas can strengthen your body immune system so that you don't catch flu or other lung illnesses. With stronger body cells, your body will be able to regenerate and repair the damage cells faster.
<br />5. To Reduce Stress
<br />If your lifestyle and work is stressful, why not get a cup of herbal tea? It's very relaxing and definitely effective at reducing stress.
<br />6. Better Sleep At Night
<br />Herbal teas can help induce sleep. If you are having trouble sleeping at night, try drinking some herbal teas 30 minutes before you <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> go to bed.
<br />7. Healthier Than Coffee
<br />Herbals teas contain less caffeine and they are definitely a good alternative to those who are health conscious enough to want to prevent tooth decays. Did you know that teas contain some a small amount of fluoride and some certain antibiotic that can help prevent gum diseases and the formation of plaque?
<br />Drinking herbal tea alone won't cause you to lose weight. If you're serious about losing weight, you will have to set aside some time everyday doing some exercises lose weight and include more healthy food in your diet. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

<br />Ann-Christine Andersson Arntén is a psychology doctoral student from the University of Gothenburg. She conducted a five-year-long study on the effects of partner relations on work stress. Andersson Arntén said <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>that people’s home lives can either help alleviate stress at work or push people over the edge.
<br />“Either you come home to something that gives you a possibility to rewind and recover or you have a relationship that makes you more troubled,” she told The Local.
<br />“If that’s the case than you cannot recover, and your whole system physically and mentally will become unbalanced. It will start to become more and more unhealthy and could end up in depression, anxiety, or sleeping problems.”
<br />About 900 male and female participants completed surveys in which they were asked to categorize their relationship in one of three categories: good, average, and bad.
<br />They were then asked to rate whether their relationship had a positive or negative effect on their work life. The results for women<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>were as expected. Women in good relationships had less stress at work, and ones in bad relationships had more work stress. However, the surprise finding was in the men’s group.
<br />“With men we found the average group experienced the most stress-related problems at work,” Andersson Arntén explained.
<br />“When we talked to the men, they said that when it’s in-between, you have to put more effort into it. You keep doing that until the relationship either becomes better or hopeless. When you get to that point, it doesn’t really affect your health anymore.”
<br />The study also found that men were often more interested in the frequency of sex than women, who were more inclined to value the quality of sexual relations.
<br />Andersson Arntén said the survey <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>results also dismiss the myth that men completely separate work life and private life. She said that men are not the only ones who can benefit from the results of the study.
<br />“People should look at the whole picture,” she said. “For employees, there is an interaction between work and family. If the family life is bad, you pay the consequences. You cannot separate the two.”
<br />She also had a few words of advice for people who are struggling in their relationships.
<br />“Sometimes you need a nutmeg of passion, an extra thing to spice things up in the relationship.”
<br />Andersson Arntén will present her dissertation about this study on Friday at the University of Gothenburg. She will also conduct another study in late August to get a better picture of why this study had the unexpected<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>results.

<br />At least one man has since found he has the virus, The Times reports.
<br />Benaissa, 26, a mother of one, became a celebrity overnight when she and four other young women won the first German series of the talent television show Popstars in 2000.
<br />They formed No Angels, who were said to have been modelled on the Spice Girls, and went on to have a string of No 1 hits. Their popularity was such that in 2002, Ms Benaissa spoke publicly of her worries that the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>group may have become too famous. “If you see No Angels in every newspaper, on every television station and hear them on every radio station, the people will at some point get sick and tired of No Angels,” she said.
<br />The group split in December 2003 before four of the original five members, including Benaissa, reformed in 2007. They were selected to represent Germany at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest with their single Disappear but finished last.
<br />Benaissa, who was born in Germany and has a Moroccan father, was arrested in Frankfurt on Saturday evening shortly before she was due to give a solo performance. She was remanded in custody after <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>a judge ruled that there was a danger she might repeat her alleged offence.
<br />The public prosecutor's office in the western town of Darmstadt said that the singer was being held because of the “urgent suspicion that the accused had unprotected sexual intercourse with three people in the years 2004 and 2006 without telling them beforehand that she was HIV positive&amp;quot;.
<br />If found guilty she could face up to 10 years in prison. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

<br />Therefore, the best way to improve vision, a secret that I am intended to tell you today, is a natural way by doing eye exercises everyday. On hearing doing eye exercises to improve vision, some will doubt whether it is effective or not. However, I am sure that it does work, but one thing should be born in mind is that it is a long journey.
<br />No one is able to get the result one day, or in several days. At least weeks' exercises are needed, while some other will take even years to get the results. Therefore, it depends on conditions of various people. Thus, the reason why <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>those who claim this natural vision improvement does not work probably is that they have never persisted to do it.
<br />I know it is boring and a little bit time-consuming, but if you keep a good mood and take the process as a kind of enjoyment, you will <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a> fall into a habit of it and finally fall in love with it.
<br />On the contrary, if you do not bring yourself to enjoy the process, you can hardly achieve. Stick to it, and do it regularly, either in your spare time or when you have a rest after work. Maybe, a week later when you are able to see the letters on the wall which you are not able to see clearly a week before, you will find it really works. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>

		<document id="c6cc1da84dda56e7e76452b5ec39a757" url=""><![CDATA[Eye Excersises For Computer Users With Tired Eyes<br/><br/>Most computer users experience eye strain. This may be as a result of using inappropriate monitors like the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) screens. Prolonged computer use may also bring about the same problem. If you experience a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>combination of regular headaches and eye strain, the problem might be associated with computer use. Sometimes computer use may interfere with your vision to the extent that you don’t see objects clearly, experience double vision in some instances, see colors differently or have irritated or dry eyes. Relief from many computer-use related eye disorders may be achieved through regular eye excersises.
<br />The success of therapeutic interventions to ease computer related eye strain is highly depended on their frequency of administration.  Some experts recommend daily eye excersises at one hour intervals. Studies have shown that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>continued staring at the computer for long periods of time is unhealthy. It may therefore help to take time every one hour of computer usage to exercise the eyes.
<br />A common therapeutic measure is palming. For good results, it may be the first thing you want to do at home after a busy day at the work place. Take a seat or lie in a bed or any other position you can be relaxed and at ease. First you need to generate some heat through rubbing of the palms of your both hands for a few seconds. Then close your eyes and put your cupped hands on top of them. Your cupped hands should be positioned such that they do not touch the eyes. Seated for about two minutes, you will begin to see intense darkness that will provide the intended therapy.
<br />There are times when looking at the computer for a long time might hinder your perception of objects especially when changing focus from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>distant to near ones or the other way around. You may check the problem by exercising your eyes by means of visually scanning items within an enclosure especially a room. You need to position yourself somewhere within the room (e.g. a corner) and begin to look at items in the room one at a time. Look at the edges of every object along the walls. Keep on doing this for about two minutes.
<br />While eye excersises are crucial to the checking of eye strain associated with prolonged computer usage or glare emanating from Cathode Ray Tube monitors, it’s also important to mention that exercises alone won’t work. You may want to fit your computer with an anti-glare screen or use the less hazardous LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors.
<br />After working on your computer for some time always remember to take a break in order to give your eye muscles an opportunity to loosen up and rejuvenate. Make it a point to do eye excersises on routine basis. Your eyes will come out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>stronger and well focused and oriented to do their work. Such exercises may also help prevent or fix eye disorders from causes other than the computer.

In fact, they saw no purpose for leaving and rarely did. Urbanites often can't imagine a life outside<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors handbags </a>of all the glamour of the city. But rural dwellers feel the same. The idea of leaving the peace and quiet of the country and moving to a place of claustrophobia and high rent seems painful.
<br />I find perks on both sides of the aisle so to speak. I grew up in Charlottesville, VA on acres of woods, undisturbed by neighbors. But later on I lived in the heart of DC, enjoying the benefits of public transportation and nightly events. But researchers have recently highlighted that green space and rural living in general is better for your health.
<br />A recent article in Natural News pointed to research which says that city life contributes to a host of health problems <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors outlet </a>while rural life does the opposite. Living with plenty of green space contributes to a longer, healthier life. Scientists pointed to issues of depression and schizophrenia as well as anxiety, other mood disorders and stress.
<br />Feeling Cramped?
<br />The results showed that we like our space and the more cramped we are, the more problems we have.
<br />According to Natural News:
<br />&quot;Previous findings have shown that the risk for anxiety disorders is 21 percent higher for people from the city, who also have a 39 percent increase for mood disorders,&quot; said Dr. Jens Pruessner of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute in Quebec, who helped conduct the study.
<br />More specifically, &quot;the study found that the region of the brain - the amygdala, which involves mood and emotions - was<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors </a>much more active in city dwellers.&quot; The reduced stress in those living in the country could have been due to more active cingulate cortexes, the part of the brain that reduces stress.
<br />Caveman Days
<br />Part of this is understandable. Living in a larger city means constant stimulation. It means that the nervous system is going a mile a minute just to keep up with its surrounding. In the caveman days stress was a good thing. It served to keep us alive. We felt anxious when a lion was on our tracks waiting for dinner or when the weather was hot and we hadn't seen water in days. But today, too much stress can do serious damage to our mental state which can lead to so many other health problems.
<br />But whether you live in the city or the country, it’s your ability to manage stress that holds the key to your health. My uncle is a farmer from a town of 1,000 and he's always stressed out worrying about the weather and his crops. The point is--take an aerial view of your life and be <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.michaelkorshandbagsoutletweb.com</a> </a>an onlooker to the anxieties that plague you. Realize that in the scheme of things, they're often no big deal at all. If you're having trouble managing stress overtime you could do real damage. As for the incidence schizophrenia, I have no idea where that plays into the picture or whether it is dependent on stress.
<br />If you can't seem to decompress, green space can help. Take the time to reconnect to nature whether that's in Central Park or Montana. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWNoYWVsa29yc2hhbmRiYWdzb3V0bGV0d2ViLmNvbQ__" target="_blank"> michael kors bags </a>
