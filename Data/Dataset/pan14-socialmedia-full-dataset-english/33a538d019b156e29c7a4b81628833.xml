Millions of people practice traditional martial arts all around the world such as Tae Kwon Do, Karate and Kung Fu. These arts have so much more to offer people than just basic self-defence, they offer a vehicle to improve your life and help make you a better person.<br /><br />But as great as these arts are in offering you practical self-defence skills, unfortunately a lot of these arts don't adequately address how to protect yourself and fight back from a clinch or on the ground.<br /><br />This is where complementing your traditional martial arts training with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu can help you round out your skill set and be more confident using your base martial art. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu excels in the clinch and on the ground like no other art! Brazilian Jiu Jitsu's primary strength is the ability to clinch safely, without getting hurt or knocked out and bring your adversary to the ground where you can end the fight with strikes or various submission holds. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu also spends the large majority of its training on the ground, learning how to protect yourself from harm, escape dangerous positions, get back to your feet and win from seemingly inferior positions.<br /><br />Now imagine if you were supremely confident that you could protect yourself no matter where the fight took place or where you ended up. Standing up exchanging strikes, grappling in the clinch, establishing control and bringing your adversary to the floor where you could finish the fight, escape to safety or even win from an inferior position should you trip or be overpowered and tackled to the ground.<br /><br />What if you had such confidence in your ability to protect yourself on the ground that you were able to use some or your high kicks and strikes that were often deemed unsuitable in a self-defence situation. Wouldn't that increase your confidence and significantly add to your arsenal of techniques to defend yourself with? What if you needed a non lethal method to control a drunken and unruly friend or relative without causing them any injury.<br /><br />Brazilian Jiu Jitsu complements traditional martial arts perfectly by offering them tried and tested grappling skills both on your feet and on the ground to add to your already formidable martial arts techniques.<br /><br />In addition with the rise in popularity of mixed martial arts and the UFC, it be great for traditional martial artists to have a complete arsenal of techniques to fight with from any situation should the wish to test their skills or bring in more students and take advantage of the mixed martial arts movement. Having solid clinch and ground skills from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu allows the martial artist to be more confident in knowing how to best use their previous training. It also allows them to offer suitable training for those people interested in mixed martial arts training. In summary Brazilian Jiu Jitsu can help you both as a student or instructor and you would be wise to supplement your training with it.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT1lYmM2Y2JmYmY4NTE0NmQzOGJmMTRhNGVkNzE4MWU0MyZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD1lYmM2Y2JmYmY4NTE0NmQzOGJmMTRhNGVkNzE4MWU0MyZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhZWJjNmNiZmJmODUxNDZkMzhiZjE0YTRlZDcxODFlNDNQb3N0JTNhZTU4ODE4ODUtNTA3Yi00MDI0LTk2ZTMtMGVhYTc2NjBlMWYy" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL21hdHRoaWpzcmFtbzcxOC81OTg5NTcwL2tpZHNfa2FyYXRlX2hvdXN0b24_" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWdib29rLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8yMzIyNDgw" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>

Often times, movie watchers observe Hollywood celebrities performing complex fighting moves and think, &quot;I wish I could do that.&quot; Basic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training teaches beginner fighters some basic moves that nearly anyone can perform. The best part about these moves is beginners use them for basic defense against an attacker.<br /><br />The first basic submission technique we will discuss for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training is the &quot;Kimura&quot; from your back. This technique requires the guard position where the fighter lies down on the ground with his or her knees elevated above the rest of the body. Once the fighter is in the guard position, he or she takes his or her hand and clamps down on the opponent's wrist, immobilizing the opponent. Next, the fighter opens his or her legs (at the knees) to elevate off the ground. The relaxed knees and lower legs position the fighter to place his or her free hand around the opponent's arm, grabbing his or her own wrist. Once the fighter grabs his or her wrist, he or she then uses their lower body strength to lie down again, bringing the right leg into the opponent's back. After the right leg pins down the opponent, the fighter takes the opponent's free arm and raises his or her right arm to the back of the opponent's neck. At this point, the opponent feels the pressure and &quot;taps out.&quot;<br /><br />The next basic submission technique for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is &quot;The Americana.&quot; The fighter goes to the mount position, which requires the knees on the ground (the fighter halfway standing on top of the opponent). Often, the opponent has his or her hands before the face, attempting to ward off attack. In this situation, the fighter cups his or her hands (without using thumbs) and applies pressure to the left hand of the opponent (at this point, the opponent still has both hands in his or her face). He or she presses the opponent's left hand to the ground (with hand still cupped), and, making sure his or her elbow is close to the opponent's head (to ensure immobility), takes the right arm, brings it under the opponent's pinned arm (the fighter grabs his or her own left wrist with the right hand), and elevates the opponent's pinned arm. At this point, the opponent, again feeling the pressure, &quot;taps out.&quot;<br /><br />The Kimura and The Americana are two basic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu submission moves that both professionals and beginners alike can perform. Despite the level ease of these basic techniques implementing these moves requires time and patience.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuZ291dGFsYW1ldHNoaXp1a28ucG9kb21hdGljLmNvbS9lbnRyeS8yMDEyLTA5LTE0VDE1XzI1XzUyLTA3XzAw" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL2VuR291dGFsYW1ldFNoaXp1a28vYmxvZy83ODY1Njc_" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhZDdlMTg2OWUzYWYyNGM2MzllNzUxMGIxMjg2Y2NlMDlQb3N0JTNhNmIwZmVjNGQtM2RiYi00MWU1LWE4MjAtZDhkY2Y1NjQ4ZDI1" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>

		<document id="8d22f941186cf3a61a3fedeb1e61357d" url=""><![CDATA[Kids Martial Arts Houston<br/><br/>For me, I still bow upon entering any Martial Arts training area and every time I enter and leave the mat as a sign of respect for the art, the philosophy of the art, the history and all those that have gone before me and will continue long after I leave. But that's just me.<br /><br />In my school I don't ask students to bow when stepping on or off the mat or addressing me... As a matter of fact I don't ask them to bow at all! I greet my students by name and with a hand shake, as this is a common courtesy and custom in Western society. My students address me by name or sometimes as &quot;Coach&quot;, I do not ask them address me by any formal title, not that there is anything wrong with that at all, this is just the way I choose to run my school.<br /><br />I am often asked why don't I make my students bow and follow more of the Eastern traditions of more formal etiquette. I have also been asked how do I maintain discipline and create a good learning environment in the school without such protocols in place.<br /><br />The answer is easy. In a word &quot;Leadership&quot;. I do my best to lead by example. I believe Respect should be earned and not demanded blindly. And the instructor should respect his/her students equally as individuals regardless of rank or any other differences. I encourage my students to ask questions, to help and protect each other when training and to have fun while on the mat. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training is challenging enough. Your ego will take a beating almost every time you step on the mat, so why not relax and have a little fun while we are training. If you have fun while training you will enjoy training and if you enjoy training you are more likely to continue regardless of any obstacles that you face. And you will face many challenges and obstacles on your path towards mastery. If you are to overcome them then your best bet it to prepare yourself and anticipate them, stay focused on your goals and learn to adapt and improvise on the fly. Anticipation, preparation, focus, adaptation and improvisation are all talents that you will develop while learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And just like the tenets of Tae Kwon Do they extend far beyond the mat and into your everyday life.<br /><br />So for those of you that train in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or any other Martial Art, I want to ask you to do something. Starting today hold yourself accountable for everything. Take responsibility for your actions and lead by example. Don't wait to be inspired, be the inspiration for others and lead by example. From time to time you will make mistakes but it is up to you how you choose to respond to them. Will you take responsibility and make the necessary adjustments to improve or will you blame others or circumstances? The choice is yours, lead by example and inspire others to start making changes in their lives or do what everyone else does and wait for change to happen... Because we can see how well that is working... Not! So choose Accountability, be a Leader and make a difference!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jZW9mdXNpb24ub3JnL25vZGUvMzQ3MDEw" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTQ4NzE4X2NsaWNrX2hlcmU_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhZDdlMTg2OWUzYWYyNGM2MzllNzUxMGIxMjg2Y2NlMDlQb3N0JTNhNjAxMGJjNjYtNTNhYy00NjQ0LWJkNDMtMjY4NThkODZjY2Q1" target="_blank">Click here</a>

It is well-respected as one of the most direct martial art styles for self-defense. In many systems of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, students actually learn an entire system of simple yet effective self-defense techniques based on those taught in Gracie.<br /><br />The Spreading Popularity of BJJ<br /><br />While it was once rare to find a qualified BJJ instructor outside of the East or West coasts of the United States, Brazilian schools and instructors now run schools in every major city in North America. Also helping spread the popularity of the art, the U.S. Army and other branches of the U.S. military have adapted Gracie JJ techniques for hand-to-hand combat. The Army even holds a yearly mixed martial arts competition where service members compete using MMA rules.<br /><br />Brazilian Jiu Jitsu History<br /><br />Although it shares a lineage with Japanese,it is a separate and unique martial art system. Sometimes called &quot;BJJ&quot; for short, the style began when judo and ju-jitsu expert Esai Maeda taught Carlos Gracie. Soon Carlos began teaching his brothers jiu-jitsu, which led to the family opening a JJ school in Brazil around 1925.<br /><br />Among the Gracie brothers, Helio was slightest of frame but not of fighting spirit. However, he discovered early on that he would need to adapt the standard techniques of ju-jitsu to allow him an advantage when facing larger opponents. The result of his developments in the art of jiu-jitsu are what is now known as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.<br /><br />Various branches of the Gracie family now teach versions of the Gracie style. However the unique heritage and tradition that is BJJ owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Grand Master Helio Gracie and his unique insights into technique. It is his emphasis on leverage and controlling the opponent through technique that is the signature of Brazilian style.<br /><br />Jiu-Jitsu - Here to Stay<br /><br />Considering the fact that mixed martial arts competition has secured a spot among the most popular of spectator sports worldwide, and with ground grappling being an integral component of MMA, it's also clear that BJJ is here to stay. Without a doubt, BJJ is destined to become as popular a past-time as martial arts such as tae kwon do and karate. With both men and women becoming interested in jiu-jitsu competition and training, the sport has a bright future ahead.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3BkeHBlYWNlLm9yZy9ibG9nL21hdHRoaWpzcmFtbzcxOC8yMDEyL3NlcC8xNC9ob3VzdG9uLW1tYQ__" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy4xMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9saWZlL2NvbW11bml0eS9wZXJzb25hLmFzcHg/VT1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1BlcnNvbmFQYWdlPUJsb2dWaWV3UG9zdCZhbXA7cGxja1VzZXJJZD1kN2UxODY5ZTNhZjI0YzYzOWU3NTEwYjEyODZjY2UwOSZhbXA7cGxja1Bvc3RJZD1CbG9nJTNhZDdlMTg2OWUzYWYyNGM2MzllNzUxMGIxMjg2Y2NlMDlQb3N0JTNhNjAxMGJjNjYtNTNhYy00NjQ0LWJkNDMtMjY4NThkODZjY2Q1" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tIw__" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>

No worries, you don't have to start out a pro athlete to get an MMA body, all it takes is hard work, dedication and a solid plan. Conditioning yourself for MMA is simple, but it can be hard work, especially without knowing how to take the first step. Well, step right up and let's get started on how to give yourself an MMA workout.<br /><br />One of the first things you need to realize is that you don't need to blow hundreds or even thousands of dollars on home weight equipment or make daily treks to the gym. In fact, most MMA training exercises can be done with little or no equipment at all, some full routines taking less than half an hour. No more excuses about not having time to fit a workout into your daily schedule. The workouts themselves aren't much different from a regular workout, just in shorter, more intense bursts to maximize effect. Usually comprised sets of reps of push ups, crunches, squats and other common exercises, the end goal is not only to be able to exert a great a mount of energy, but also to be able to keep up that energy for an extended period of time as though in an MMA match. Benching 200 lbs isn't very impressive if you can't keep that level of energy up long enough to win.<br /><br />Nutrition is another core aspect of the MMA workout. If you're working hard to build muscle and then going out for lunch at the local fast food place then you may as well have not done your workout to begin with. Try to cut non-essentials like fats and sugars from soda or junk food and instead focus on nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables and protein rich lean meats and nuts. Try taking a day out of the week to roast an entire chicken or cook a stew and divide that up over several meals in the week to reduce daily prep time. Don't forget to load up on foods rich in vitamins and minerals or at least make sure you're taking the correct supplements. In addition, try to eat several small meals over the course of the day instead of 2-3 larger meals to help combat energy loss from your workouts.<br /><br />Once you've settled on a nutrition plan and workout, the MOST important thing to do is to stick with it. The difficulty of keeping up with such an intense workout is the most common cause of a failed workout regimen. If the same routines are becoming boring or are too straining to continue with, just switch up your training or meal plans to adapt to what works for you. Consistency in both your workout habits and your diet combined will have you admiring yourself in the mirror in no time.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsQXJ0cy5jb20_" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20va2lja2JveGluZ2hvdXN0b24_" target="_blank">This site</a>

Your left hand will be on the side of their hip, your left forearm curling down around their thigh. With your right arm, work it through between the two of you until your right hand is against their left hipbone. This will take some work; it's easier if you anticipate the cross-side control coming, and get on your side and put your right arm across your body before your opponent closes in on you. As much as you can, straighten out your arms and control the space between you and your opponent. If you can achieve a stiff-arm position with one or both arms, the rest of the escape will be MUCH easier.<br /><br />Muscle groups used - chest, shoulders, arms<br /><br />Step 2: Shrimp on to your side<br /><br />The shrimping motion is perhaps the most common in all of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. When you shrimp, you bridge up using one leg, putting your weight on the opposite shoulder. The bridge creates room underneath you to slide your free hip through, so you can be on your side instead of your back. It will be hard to bridge with most of your opponent's weight on your chest...fortunately you don't have to go very high for the shrimp to work. The higher you can bridge, however, the better, to affect your opponent's balance and to create more room for you to move.<br /><br />In this particular position, you will bring your right heel in toward your butt. Use that foot to bridge up, driving some of your weight on to your left shoulder. At this point, only two parts of your body should be in contact with the mat. Slide your left hip underneath your body, and end up on your side, facing your opponent. Make a circle with your left foot, rotating your left leg from in front of your opponent. If there isn't enough room to get your left leg completely out of the way, either because your opponent is driving forward to keep it in place, or just because you're not flexible enough...don't worry about it. Just move a little farther to your right, using your right leg to push against their hip, to make the extra space necessary to free your left leg.<br /><br />Muscle groups used - legs, abdominals, back<br /><br />With a training partner, do three escapes from each side, then switch places...you'll be in the top side mount, and your partner does the escape. After 15 minutes of switching places and doing the escape, you will feel the workout EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />For more strain on your upper body, escape to your knees, rather than to the full guard. Instead of one shrimping motion, just enough to get your bottom leg through...make a couple of big shrimps, bringing your body around nearly 270 degrees. I don't need a meticulous 90-day training plan...a DVD system...a set of weights...an expensive machine...all I need is a mat, and someone to roll with!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXluLmNvbS93YXluYmxvZy5odG1sP3djaT12aWV3ZW50cnkmYW1wO2VudHJ5X2tleT0xMjgxNjM4" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hvdXN0b24ta2lja2JveGluZzYyLm9uc3VnYXIuY29tL0tpZHMtbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWNsYXNzZXMtSG91c3Rvbi0yNDk2ODY5Nw__" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hdHRoaWpzcmFtbzcxOC5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL2tpZHMta2FyYXRlLWNsYXNzZXMtaG91c3Rvbi00NDE2NA__" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>

In the stage of being a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Blue Belt, you should internalize strong basics for every position you learn.

The aim of BJJ is to overcome your opponent by a combination of the correct position and submission holds.<br /><br />Getting Started with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu<br /><br />As a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighter, you would need to appreciate the importance of striking at the right time. You learn to wait patiently for your counterpart to commit a mistake or give you the positional advantage. You can consider practicing self restraint before starting to train for this kind of martial arts. Focus plays an essential part, while learning and gaining mastery over BJJ. Students are trained to develop and sustain their focus and concentration, since a single lapse can turn the tables during a fight.<br /><br />Contrary to the belief that martial arts are violent, the primary aim of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is to avoid any physical harm, even to the opponent. Students learn to manipulate their bodies into various positions and submission holds, to disarm and pin down one's opponent.<br /><br />Techniques to Excel<br /><br />Ground fighting and grappling are primary techniques used in Jiu Jitsu. Ground fighting refers to a hand-to-hand combat, where both opponents are on the ground. This is akin to real life danger situations and hence a helpful form of self defense. The aim is to get your opponent down to the ground and lock them into submission using techniques like Side Control, Full Mount, Guard and Submissions (Joint locks and chokes).<br /><br />Side Control - In this technique, you need to hold your opponent to the ground using your side body. This technique may need a bit of practice, as you need to learn to concentrate all your weight on one side of the body.<br /><br />Full Mount - It is one of the strongest gripping positions. In this position, the opponent is on his back and the practitioner on the opponent's chest. The strongest position in this technique is when the practitioner moves up towards the opponents arm pits. This reduces the ability of the opponent to counter the attack.<br /><br />Guard - This is a technique, preferred widely amongst Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fighters. Here, the practitioner is on his back and has wrapped his legs around his opponent to limit his movement. Guard is mainly used as a self defense posture. A situation where the practitioner's ankles are crossed around the opponent is called closed guard. If your ankles around the opponent are not crossed, it is called an open guard.<br /><br />Submission- Submission technique can be grouped in two categories: Chokes and Joint Locks. Chokes and strangles can put pressure on the opponent's arteries and stop the blood flow to the brain, causing them to lose consciousness within seconds.<br /><br />In Joint Lock Submission, the practitioner uses his opponent's limb and creates a lever with his body position. This will force the opponent's joints to move against its normal behavior. The practitioner keeps increasing the pressure until the opponent accepts defeat.<br /><br />All the above techniques of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu primarily aim at causing no physical harm, while still overcoming a larger and stronger opponent. If you too wish to be armed with this remarkable martial art for facing any threatening situation that life throws at you, join a BJJ class now!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Njb2xhaW9oYWFuaTYxNS5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL2tpZHMtbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWhvdXN0b24tNzAzODQ_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/matthijsramos/blog/blogid=12063408" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvc2VhcmNoLz90YWc9a2lkcyttYXJ0aWFsK2FydHMrY2xhc3Nlcytob3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>

In this part, I will be explaining some of the principles dealing with efficient use of force a student should keep in mind while trying to sweep an opponent on the ground.<br /><br />Control Your Opponent's Momentum<br /><br />Most people would agree that being as strong and athletic as possible is very useful for becoming effective in any sport. The sport of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is no exception to this rule. It's quite obvious that a larger, stronger and more athletic person is always going to have the edge over a smaller weaker one. Even in a martial art like Brazilian jiu-jitsu, where size and strength don't seem to matter as much, one can attest to the fact that a larger opponent with technique is much harder to defeat than a smaller opponent with technique. A problem arises though when people gifted with such traits rely solely on them to the point which they never develop a full understanding of the principles behind jiu-jitsu.<br /><br />A lot of people forget that the word &quot;jiu&quot; in jiu-jitsu refers to yielding principles, or the ability to give way and manipulate the opponent's force against himself rather than confronting it with one's own force. Excessive reliance on strength and athleticism can act as a hindrance to your overall progression and lead to unnecessary injury to yourself and to your opponent. It is essential that as a practitioner of the art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, you develop the ability to react and stay focused on what your opponent does from moment to moment. In the following paragraph I will discuss a few of the ways someone can accomplish this.<br /><br />There are some key things you need to keep in mind when rolling in class to make make your jiu-jitsu more efficient. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, it's important to understand that should you strive never to fight head-on with your opponent's strength but rather to move your body in unison with it. This is especially true when facing a larger and stronger opponent. When rolling in class, always try to feel what is happening as your opponent moves his body in different directions. You want to combine any force the opponent gives you with your own to generate more power in your techniques. When your opponent drives forward, pull him forward into you, and when he resists backwards, push into him backwards. When he leans his weight to the right, push his weight to the right or if to the left push to the left.<br /><br />In BJJ one of the primary positions you spend practicing in is the closed guard. In this position, you are lying on your back with your opponent between your legs and your feet crossed behind his back. By keeping these principles in mind, it makes it much easier to sweep your opponents no matter how strong they are.<br /><br />Keep training hard, and never give up in your pursuit to one day become a great champion.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvbm9yamRteXBndWZqdnFiZXBiemUvY29udGVudC9ob3VzdG9uLWtpY2tib3hpbmctNjQyNjUzMg__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/matthijsramos/blog/blogid=12063408" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvc2VhcmNoLz90YWc9a2lkcyttYXJ0aWFsK2FydHMrY2xhc3Nlcytob3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>

As the population in any region increases, it naturally follows that problems such as muggings and robberies are bound to increase. If you live in a city or town, you may find that you need to take a few measures to ensure that you are protected from such occurrences.<br /><br />By simply making sure that you are never in isolated streets and that you try to walk in groups, you can accomplish this with ease. However, there are times when you may need to confront an assailant, and in such cases it would also be an advantage to have a few tricks up your sleeve.<br /><br />The best way to protect yourself when in such a situation is to make use of martial arts, especially if you do not have any sort of weapon to protect yourself with. When you go through listings on the internet and in newspapers, you will notice that there are numerous places where you can take martial arts classes for a very low price. It is therefore always a good idea to invest some time and money into such, as you may never know when it is going to come in handy.<br /><br />However, not all kinds of martial arts may be good enough for you. Most of the martial arts have a particular theme that they depend on. For instance, if you are a particularly small or slender individual, you may find that most of the martial arts such as kickboxing may not be particularly useful to you, since some of them may need someone to use their mass for mounting an offensive or defending yourself. If you are not heavy enough, you may find that such martial arts are not good enough for you to protect yourself.<br /><br />In such cases, you can try to take advantage of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. This is one of the best martial arts to learn, since it can benefit anyone of any size. If you are huge, you can learn it and become adept at protecting yourself in case you need to. If you are small, you will also find Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to be the ideal martial art, since it enables ones to fight using the benefit of leverage and grappling. In fact, this martial art was developed for use by smaller and weaker individuals, and if you learn it correctly you will find that it is very easy for you to subdue much bigger and stronger individuals.<br /><br />For this reason, this kind of martial art is especially good for females. It is a well-known fact that most crimes such as petty robberies are targeted to women since they are seen as weaker and less likely to put up a fight. However, the problem is that this also means that they are more susceptible to harrowing experiences such as rape. By taking the time to learn Jiu Jitsu, you can give any assailant quite a surprise, since you will be able to disable them within a very short time despite your lack of mass or strength!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvcWZpeHRrZnVxZnByZWt4YW5xb28vY29udGVudC9ob3VzdG9uLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy02NDI2NTYw" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy52aWxhZ28yMS5jb20vZXZlbnQvVGhpcytzaXRlLzEzOTYzMjAvcHJvZmlsZQ__" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JvcnltY2Nhbm44MjEuZG11c2ljLm5ldC9qb3VybmFsLzE1NjA2MDQ_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>

Often times, movie watchers observe Hollywood celebrities performing complex fighting moves and think, &quot;I wish I could do that.&quot; Basic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training teaches beginner fighters some basic moves that nearly anyone can perform. The best part about these moves is beginners use them for basic defense against an attacker.<br /><br />The first basic submission technique we will discuss for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training is the &quot;Kimura&quot; from your back. This technique requires the guard position where the fighter lies down on the ground with his or her knees elevated above the rest of the body. Once the fighter is in the guard position, he or she takes his or her hand and clamps down on the opponent's wrist, immobilizing the opponent. Next, the fighter opens his or her legs (at the knees) to elevate off the ground. The relaxed knees and lower legs position the fighter to place his or her free hand around the opponent's arm, grabbing his or her own wrist. Once the fighter grabs his or her wrist, he or she then uses their lower body strength to lie down again, bringing the right leg into the opponent's back. After the right leg pins down the opponent, the fighter takes the opponent's free arm and raises his or her right arm to the back of the opponent's neck. At this point, the opponent feels the pressure and &quot;taps out.&quot;<br /><br />The next basic submission technique for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is &quot;The Americana.&quot; The fighter goes to the mount position, which requires the knees on the ground (the fighter halfway standing on top of the opponent). Often, the opponent has his or her hands before the face, attempting to ward off attack. In this situation, the fighter cups his or her hands (without using thumbs) and applies pressure to the left hand of the opponent (at this point, the opponent still has both hands in his or her face). He or she presses the opponent's left hand to the ground (with hand still cupped), and, making sure his or her elbow is close to the opponent's head (to ensure immobility), takes the right arm, brings it under the opponent's pinned arm (the fighter grabs his or her own left wrist with the right hand), and elevates the opponent's pinned arm. At this point, the opponent, again feeling the pressure, &quot;taps out.&quot;<br /><br />The Kimura and The Americana are two basic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu submission moves that both professionals and beginners alike can perform. Despite the level ease of these basic techniques implementing these moves requires time and patience.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvb2hrb2NvZm9mYnBneHl3bnlubGEvY29udGVudC90aGlzLXNpdGUtNjQyNjU3MA__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9yb3J5bWNjYW5uODIxL3Bvc3RzLzIzODExNTcvS2lkcyttYXJ0aWFsK2FydHMrY2xhc3NlcytIb3VzdG9u" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JvcnltY2Nhbm44MjEuamlnc3kuY29tL2VudHJpZXMvZ2VuZXJhbC9Ib3VzdG9uLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cw__" target="_blank">This site</a>

		<document id="894db7bc76607ff663d5c57c0dae39fc" url=""><![CDATA[Kids Martial Arts Houston<br/><br/>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is considered by many to be the most effective and efficient martial art for fighting on the ground. It is well-respected as one of the most direct martial art styles for self-defense. In many systems of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, students actually learn an entire system of simple yet effective self-defense techniques based on those taught in Gracie.<br /><br />The Spreading Popularity of BJJ<br /><br />While it was once rare to find a qualified BJJ instructor outside of the East or West coasts of the United States, Brazilian schools and instructors now run schools in every major city in North America. Also helping spread the popularity of the art, the U.S. Army and other branches of the U.S. military have adapted Gracie JJ techniques for hand-to-hand combat. The Army even holds a yearly mixed martial arts competition where service members compete using MMA rules.<br /><br />Brazilian Jiu Jitsu History<br /><br />Although it shares a lineage with Japanese,it is a separate and unique martial art system. Sometimes called &quot;BJJ&quot; for short, the style began when judo and ju-jitsu expert Esai Maeda taught Carlos Gracie. Soon Carlos began teaching his brothers jiu-jitsu, which led to the family opening a JJ school in Brazil around 1925.<br /><br />Among the Gracie brothers, Helio was slightest of frame but not of fighting spirit. However, he discovered early on that he would need to adapt the standard techniques of ju-jitsu to allow him an advantage when facing larger opponents. The result of his developments in the art of jiu-jitsu are what is now known as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.<br /><br />Various branches of the Gracie family now teach versions of the Gracie style. However the unique heritage and tradition that is BJJ owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to Grand Master Helio Gracie and his unique insights into technique. It is his emphasis on leverage and controlling the opponent through technique that is the signature of Brazilian style.<br /><br />Jiu-Jitsu - Here to Stay<br /><br />Considering the fact that mixed martial arts competition has secured a spot among the most popular of spectator sports worldwide, and with ground grappling being an integral component of MMA, it's also clear that BJJ is here to stay. Without a doubt, BJJ is destined to become as popular a past-time as martial arts such as tae kwon do and karate. With both men and women becoming interested in jiu-jitsu competition and training, the sport has a bright future ahead.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hdHRoaWpzcmFtbzcxOC5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL2hvdXN0b24ta2lja2JveGluZy03MjE2Mw__" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hdHRoaWpzcmFtbzcxOC5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTU1MzUyNA__" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53YXluLmNvbS93YXluYmxvZy5odG1sP3djaT12aWV3ZW50cnkmYW1wO2VudHJ5X2tleT0xMjgxNjU2" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>
