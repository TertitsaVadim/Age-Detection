Now unfold the arms to fold them again in an opposite manner.  <br />    Note your reaction to how this feels. <br /><br />Are you feeling uneasy and odd?  Firstly you folded the arm in the way you naturally do it. You did not have to think about how you did it because you have an existing pattern; it’s automatic and feels right.  But in 2nd action you assumed primary and did once. It may even have taken several attempts to achieve.

I've been aligning myself this new way for about six months now and noticed it to get a substantially simpler and quicker method of getting aligned although going for walks or managing. <br /> If we abide by ChiRunning and ChiWalking books then we now have to face with out ft in a length equal to our hip width and must stay away from knees locking. After that, we go to straightening your upper spine and this is where one of the changes comes in. <br /><br />We used to have you place one hand over your belly and the thumb and middle finger of the other hand spread apart and placed just under your collarbone. Then we had you pull down with your lower hand while lifting with your upper hand to straighten your upper body.  Now just use your index finger to carry your chin upward and to align it with head and neck region.

If you look at the direction the arrows are pointing, you'll see that the arrows begin at T12/L1 and move in opposite directions.  Arrows in upper section of ‘C’ shape go up to present the lengthening of neck and those positioning downwards at head front area, finally ends at chin point.  If you see the lower section of ‘C’ shape you will see arrows pointing towards the tail bone, returning back to pelvic area and end at the point of public bone.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fposturecorrection101.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F03%2Fpoor-posture-examples.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://posturecorrection101.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/poor-posture-examples.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;posture exercises]<br /><br />Practice getting yourself into the &quot;C&quot; shape whenever you feel your posture slipping…whether you're sitting at your desk, standing, walking or managing.

So, I needed to come up with a way that everyone would be able to get their head in the right alignment without the use of their hands. Here it is…it's easy. <br /><br />Just place your hand at the back of your neck and then start brushing in upward direction.  While doing this practice just move upward on the back of your head as you are attempting to touch the sky with the crown of your head.  In this way you can stretch the muscles present at the back of your neck and can make you chin get back to the natural position.  You can also strengthen your upper spine area with no use of your hands for it. <br /><br />Today every person present in my walking and running classes follow this exercise easily.  You have to begin with your correct poor posture status and then move on to rising your head slowly which will make your spine straight and lengthen your neck back area.  Such focus of upward motion will help in straightening the posture along with shifting pressure from footstep to upwards eventually making your footsteps lighter. <br /><br />Having your neck in the correct position has an effect on the rest of your spine all the way down to your tailbone.  It will make easier for you to level your pelvic and help to relax your shoulders.  It is an important step of ‘C’ shape, a concept I am following and teaching myself not mentioned in ChiRunning book at all.    <br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.posturepro.com%2FPNBrochure2.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.posturepro.com/PNBrochure2.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;posture correction]<br /><br />While having a look over ChiRunning Posture Image you will see that ‘C’ shape is super imposed on it subject. If you look at the direction the arrows are pointing, you'll see that the arrows begin at T12/L1 and move in opposite directions.  Arrows in upper section of ‘C’ shape go up to present the lengthening of neck and those positioning downwards at head front area, finally ends at chin point.

Some body parts become overstressed including shoulders and neck while others become weaker like lower back area.  Poor posture is the factor due to which several types of posture exercises have been developed to correct it.  But during these exercises we put lot of emphasis over certain muscles for improving posture which disturbs the overall reflex system. <br /><br />Your body has built-in postural reflexes to coordinate muscular activity for support and movement.  In case of having poor posture the reflexes are not allowed to work as they need to do.  You used to make your neck and shoulders stiff due to being overstressed.  Due to such problems the natural body mechanism gets disturbed and posture as well.  The constant improper use of muscles can cause creating issues in your movements.  It creates a complex situation for you.  So the more you will take positions according to wrong pattern, the better adjustments your muscles will make with it. Whilst I appreciate the popularity of exercises to improve posture, including core stability routines, I believe they result in unnecessary tension in the body.  What should we do to get our body stand on right footing?  Is it the best natural way to stand? <br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.targetwoman.com%2Fimage%2Fposture-correction.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.targetwoman.com/image/posture-correction.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;posture correction]<br /><br />Being a teacher of The Alexander Technique I have seen several people suffering from the bad outcome of poor posture.  Most of cases were involved following instruction for correcting poor posture. <br /><br />Poise can be achieved just by pushing the stress and tension out of your body and letting it respond to the power of gravity.  If you are having no issue in walking with spring then it shows you are having poise.

One person's chin would be too low and another's would be too high.  It seems also uncomfortable to align yourself while moving. So, I needed to come up with a way that everyone would be able to get their head in the right alignment without the use of their hands.  So see that how easily you can do it. <br /><br />No put the hand on the neck back and brush with the fingers in an upside direction. While you're doing this, lift up on the back of your head, like you're trying to reach for the sky with the crown of your head.  It will help your neck back muscles to stretch and your chin will automatically get back to its natural position.  You can also strengthen your upper spine area with no use of your hands for it. <br /><br />Now, in all my walking and running classes I have everyone do this easy little exercise.  You have to begin with your correct poor posture status and then move on to rising your head slowly which will make your spine straight and lengthen your neck back area.  Such focus of upward motion will help in straightening the posture along with shifting pressure from footstep to upwards eventually making your footsteps lighter. <br /><br />If your neck is in correct position it will affect the whole spine area.  It will make easier for you to level your pelvic and help to relax your shoulders.  It is an important step of ‘C’ shape, a concept I am following and teaching myself not mentioned in ChiRunning book at all.    <br /><br />While having a look over ChiRunning Posture Image you will see that ‘C’ shape is super imposed on it subject.  Look the direction of arrows which start from T12/L1 position and then move oppositely.  In ‘C’ shape you will see arrow in upper part will point towards upside showing the lengthening of neck back area while other points through the front of head region and end at chin area. The lower section of the &quot;C&quot; shape runs down towards the tailbone and then comes back up on the front side of the pelvis, ending at the pubic bone (when leveling the pelvis, you lift up on the pubic bone). <br /><br />Practice getting yourself into the &quot;C&quot; shape whenever you feel your posture slipping…whether you're sitting at your desk, standing, walking or running. It'll have the amazing effect of bringing your mind and your body together, because you'll be engaging your core in the midst of your activity and bringing yourself to the &quot;center&quot; of your experience. <br /><br />Your posture is crucial for your movement and your structural support.  If you are strong in center with balanced posture it will affect your emotional and mental capabilities as well.  So don’t leave practicing to correct posture as your life quality relies on it.<br />Tips on how to choose a sports bra <br /><br />Most of the times if you work out, you constantly want to look your ideal sports bra by having a sexy design that can flatter and flaunt your assets. <br />If you work out, you constantly look for the ideal sports bra which has a sexy design that can flatter and flaunt your assets. <br /><br />Aside from looking very good, you want to wear a sports bra that can highlight and define your back, such as a Champion sport bra. <br />A champion sports bra can highlight and define your back while making you look good.<br /><br />Of course, this type of sports bra can offer you the support and breast compression which you have to have within your sports activities and exercises.<br />In sports activities and exercises, it is important to buy a bra which offers you support and breast compression. <br /><br />What to take into account in discovering the ideal Champion sport bra?<br /> What are some of the most important features that need to be taken into account before purchasing an ideal sports bra?<br /><br />Because of the vastness of the sports bra brands in the market, discovering the outstanding sports bra is surely a great dilemma.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nob3AuaW50ZWxsaXNraW4ubmV0" target="_blank">intelliskin.net</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbnRlbGxpc2tpbi5uZXQ_" target="_blank">check here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Nob3AuaW50ZWxsaXNraW4ubmV0L2hvdy10by1maXgtYmFkLXBvc3R1cmUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">click this link</a><br /><br />Tip number 2.
