<br /><br />By: Seaira Allen
<br /><br />God bless you
<br />sleeping so soft 
<br />by young king's side.
<br />Leaving us here to remember you.
<br /> The way you made us feel,
<br />and the way you held your pride,
<br />but when you
<br />left us here 
<br />no longer by our side.
<br /><br />Left with out you 
<br />we no longer felt the same.
<br />No longer haveing you, we cried.
<br />So I say God bless you
<br />when all along God blessed us
<br />with you, and our fears subside.
<br />God bless you
<br />sleeping so soft
<br />by young king's side.

<br /><br />By: Seaira Allen
<br /><br />She walks along side
<br />the water's edge. Forever
<br />inbound by the thoughts the haunt
<br />the sleep of the forgotten.
<br /><br />Now knowing the she connot hide.
<br />Traped by what she cannot see. Never
<br />to leave the hateful silence to flaunt.
<br />She'll be a unfrequented misbegotten.
<br /><br />Giving up all once desired pride.
<br />She will not endeavor
<br />in the cage which she stays dreaming of jaunt.
<br />They treat her with a rotten
<br /><br />attitude. Now they know she lied
<br />about her past. They didn't mind, however
<br />they did with much joy taunt
<br />her. When they stoped she was frozen.

<br /><br />By SeairaAllen
<br /><br />In a thousand pieces
<br />I walked to find the place
<br />of which I will find peace.
<br />There I may find the pieces
<br />of which I walked to find the place
<br />where I will find pleasure.
<br /><br />If  I  cannot find what I  desire
<br />the way of my people will consider me dead
<br />the thoughts of my people grows deep
<br />within. One of the wize men will desire
<br />to walk with tho so called &quot;dead&quot;.
<br />He wanted to see what some call the &quot;dreamers&quot;.
<br /><br />Someday I'll have the courage
<br />and the ability to meet you, the connection
<br />must be strong, and  true. A cartouche
<br />will be found, by the one who has little courage  
<br />and, yet  he alone can repair the connection
<br />  which has been broken by the cartouche and one who cavils.

<br /><br />As plain as you can be
<br />The place is Picadilly
<br />The player He and She
<br /><br />She whispered &quot;Will it hurt me?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Of course not&quot; answered he
<br />&quot;It's a very simple process,
<br />You can rely on me.&quot;
<br /><br />She said &quot;I'm frightened,
<br /><br />I've not had this before.
<br />My friend has had it five times.
<br />And said it can be sore.&quot;
<br /><br />Then finally contented
<br /><br />Laid back and relaxed a bit
<br />Quickly and readily he bent over her
<br />And then he started it
<br /><br />It was growing rather painful
<br /><br />Tears formed in her eyes
<br />It was hurting quite a bit now
<br />It must have been quite a size
<br /><br />&quot;Calm yourself,&quot; he whispered
<br /><br />His face was filled with a grin
<br />&quot;Try and open a bit wider
<br />So I can get it in&quot;.
<br /><br />&quot;It's coming now,&quot;he whispered.
<br /><br />&quot;I know.&quot;she cried in a bliss 
<br />Feeling it deep within her now
<br />She said &quot;I am glad I am having this..&quot;
<br /><br />And with final effort
<br /><br />She gave a frightened shout.
<br />He gripped it in anguish
<br />And quickly pulled it out.
<br /><br />She lay back quite contented
<br /><br />Sighed and gave a smile
<br />She said,&quot; I am glad I came now
<br />You made it worth my while.&quot;
<br /><br />Now if you read this carefully
<br /><br />The dentist you will find..
<br />Is not what you imagined
<br />It's just your dirty mind!!

<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can change your music taste to impress a guy but when it comes to a girl who likes her own music and her own style, you give her a mouthful?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that a guy can get away with being a gangsta but the emo gets a mouthful from everyone
<br /><br />- Are you laughing?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny an emo can be quiet all through the week but gets more shit from everyone than the girl who sleeps around and sells her virginity?
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you dont mind your friends drinking, smoking but the minute someone mentions emo music you can give them a lecture on melodramatic teenage outcasts?
<br /><br />- Im not laughing
<br /><br />Its so funny that you and your friends can make a girls life hell and not know anything about the silent battle she might be fighting.
<br /><br />Isnt it funny that you can call emos, punks, goths the retards but still manage to get through your day without an inch of guilt in your heart.
<br /><br />How can you call a girl a poser, how can you say &quot;you're emo&quot; or &quot;attention seeker&quot; without spending a second trying to figure out why there are cuts on her wrists and why she spends her lunchtimes crying instead of laughing with her friends
<br /><br />- Keep on laughing
<br /><br />Isnt it funny you can say and do all this without any idea of what is going on in this persons life
<br /><br />without knowing her situation with her friends
<br /><br />or her family
<br /><br />or her Life
<br /><br />Brave isnt going up on stage and stripping
<br /><br />Brave is not saying a speech
<br /><br />Or dumping your boyfriend
<br /><br />Brave is
<br /><br />Going to school on mufti day and not for a second caring what the whores around you are saying about your clothes
<br /><br />Its listening to your own music and being proud of it
<br /><br />Its going through every day with the things people say to your face and behind your back and you still keep quiet
<br /><br />Its knowing what your &quot;friends&quot; are saying about you and still calling them your friends
<br /><br />Brave is knowing that tomorrow isnt a bright and happy future
<br /><br />Its another day of bitching and dodging rumours
<br /><br />- Laugh if you must, but it is NOT funny.
