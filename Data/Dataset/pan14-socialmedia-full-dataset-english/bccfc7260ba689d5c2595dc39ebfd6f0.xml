In addition to size, GPT disks also offer more partitions and greater resilience to corruption.  This article examines MBR and GPT-based Windows disks discussing, their benefits and disadvantages.
<br /><br />Microsoft adopted the GPT disk partitioning scheme in 2001 from Intel’s EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) specifications.  It accommodates disk partition sizes up to 18 EB (Exabyte’s) or 1 million terabytes.  Each GUID (globally unique ID) partition contains a 36-character field to allow a readable name to be associated with each partition.
<br /><br />The original method of partitioning disks is referred to as MBR (Master Boot Record) which was developed during the 1980’s.  Although widely accepted, this scheme has many shortcomings including partitions being limited to 2TB (terabytes) in size. Another shortcoming of MBR-based disk partitions is the limitation of 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition.  The extended partition can be further divided into multiple logical partitions.  By limiting the number of partitions on a disk, you effectively reduce the number of partitions to organize or manage the data.
<br /><br />The 2 approaches differ with how they track the mapping of physical disk sectors to logical block numbers.  With GPT-based disks, Microsoft supports up to 128 partitions per disk.  There are several partitions reserved for dynamic disks and EFI-boot support so only 124 partitions are available for data.
<br /><br />GPT disks are gaining popularity with their benefits in terms of partition size, number of partitions, and resilience.  Windows Failover Clusters now support GPT-based disks which will broaden their use in enterprise data centers. So while bigger isn’t always better, the many advantages of GPT-based drives make them an attractive alternative.

<br /><br />Question:
<br /><br />I can’t start my laptop after installing windows 8 because it asks me for a password that I can’t remember.
<br /><br />It was a while ago that i installed it, but I tried using it last night and I can’t get past the sign in page.
<br /><br />Please help me.
<br /><br />Answer:
<br /><br />You may have to boot with the installation DVD, and process through and select Advanced or Troubleshoot on the screens that come up, until you get to the last one. There you can boot in Safe Mode.
<br /><br />You can then try Control Panel…User Accounts, and attempt to fix the problem.
<br /><br />You may be able to change the password just by deleting it, or create a new one.
<br /><br />You may have to create a new account with administrator priviledges… select no login or passwords for this account.
<br /><br />They can be added later when things are working better.
<br /><br />If this works, you can leave it this way and use this account, or try to re-establish your original.
<br /><br />I can’t guarantee this will work, but it is the only option I can think of.
<br /><br />PS…this worked for some one else.
<br /><br />Note: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWNvdmVyd2luZG93c3Bhc3N3b3JkLmNvbS93aW5kb3dzLTctcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Windows 7 password reset</a> is a solved problem.

<br />Have you ever accidentally deleted a file or an email only to realize you didn’t know how to get it back? Deleted files can be frustrating, but don’t panic. You can recover deleted files, it just takes patients.
<br /><br />Answer: You can recover deleted files by restoring the deleted files from the Recycle Bin (Depending upon your operating system, your deleted files are temporarily sent to the Recycle Bin or the Trash Bin.) or you may be able to recover deleted files using a file recovery program.
<br /><br />Here’s the method you should use to recover deleted files:
<br />1. How to recover the deleted files from the Recycle Bin?
<br />The Recycle Bin should be the first place you look to recover deleted files. If you haven’t yet emptied the Recycle Bin, your deleted files will still be located here. You can recover deleted files from the Recycle Bin by simply restoring the files to their original locations.
<br /><br />2. How to recover the deleted files with a Free File Recovery Program?

This is thought to be more secure than using a password – people generally aren’t very good at choosing secure passwords, but the number of permutations of gestures on a photo are vast, and so much more difficult to second-guess.

The next screen lets you move the picture around a little, and when you are happy, you can choose Use this picture. Now comes the important part. Draw three gestures on the picture, they can be any combination of circles, straight lines and taps. Complete the process by repeating the gestures. You have to be quite precise. Now whenever you login, you’ll have to repeat the three gestures.
<br /><br />Windows Defender
<br /><br />Windows Defender is Microsoft’s very own anti-malware client, and it’s been updated in Windows 8 so that it will protect against viruses and spyware, and provide real-time detection. You can scan your computer and any attached devices any time you want, too.

		<document id="ee548213ecf4f6dae36b2f94720b6e9a" url=""><![CDATA[Windows 8 Anti-Spyware App Windows Defender<br/><br/>Tech site PC World said on Friday that Windows 8 will come with an upgraded version of the anti-spyware app Windows Defender, one that now has antivirus functions.
<br /><br />“Windows Defender now provides similar protection – and a similar look and feel – to that of the free Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus program, which Microsoft has offered to users as an optional download since 2009,” PC World said.
<br /><br />While Windows Defender will provide “basic” protection against viruses and malware, PC World said this may render optional the buying of yearly antivirus subscriptions or downloading a free AV app.
<br /><br />However, it said users can still disable Windows Defender and use another antivirus utility.
<br /><br />Windows 8 will also have better download screening, using a SmartScreen filter like that in Internet Explorer 9 to help detect and block potentially malicious programs.
<br /><br />“(T)he function complements IE’s website filtering, which works to block phishing and malicious sites. Starting with Windows 8, the program-monitoring portion of the SmartScreen Filter is built into Windows itself, and it will work whether you’re using IE, Firefox, Chrome, or any other browser,” the site said.
<br /><br />An added bonus of sorts for Windows users is that with SmartScreen filtering potentially unwanted apps, Microsoft will remove the previous Security Warning alerts when one first opens a downloaded program.
<br /><br />“This is a welcome change, as it cuts down on the number of alerts you have to click through–with Windows 8, you’ll see an alert only when something’s amiss,” it said.
<br /><br />To better protect your data, set a strong password for your account. But what if you forgot Windows 7 password?

Besides windows user password, there are other types of passwords on the computer. Let’s learn it one by one.
<br />If just when you start the computer, it asks for a password, this password may be power-on password, hard disk password or system password.
<br />How to set power-on password and hard disk password?
<br />1. Power on computer;
<br />2. Press F2 or other keys to login BIOS screen and select password tab;
<br />3. Choose Password and press Enter key with arrow keys;
<br />4. Input power on password or hard disk password, and press Enter key. Then confirm password as the wizard;
<br />5. Save all changes and logout BIOS screen by pressing F10 key;
<br />6. Restart computer.
<br />Tip: Different motherboards have various BIOS structure, just find to set password.
<br />How to set system password?
<br />1 To set system password, you need to set supervisor password as power-on password at first.
<br />2 Then go to security option under Advanced BIOS Features, change it from Setup to System.
<br />If you choose Setup, it will ask for password when you enter BIOS, which is BIOS password.  If you select System, it will require a password once you boot the computer, which is system password.
<br />All the above three kinds of passwords will be removed if supervisor password is cleared. But it is not an easy task to remove supervisor password if you forgot it, compared with the method to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS9yZXNldC13aW5kb3dzLTctcGFzc3dvcmQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">reset windows 7 password</a> for user account.

And like people, they don’t obey Moore’s Law–You can’t expect next year’s batteries to last twice as long as this year’s. Battery technology may improve a bit over time (after all, there’s plenty of financial incentive for better batteries), but, while interesting possibilities may pop up, don’t expect major battery breakthroughs in the near future.
<br /><br />Don’t Run It Down to Empty
<br />Squeezing every drop of juice out of a lithium ion battery (the type used in today’s laptops) strains and weakens it. Doing this once or twice won’t kill the battery, but the cumulative effect of frequently emptying your battery will shorten its lifespan.
<br /><br />Keep It Cool
<br />Heat breaks down the battery, and reduces its overall life.
<br /><br />When you use your laptop, make sure the vents are unblocked. Never work with the laptop on pillows or cushions. If possible, put it on a raised stand that allows for plenty of airflow.
<br />Also, clean the vents every so often with a can of compressed air. You can buy this for a few dollars at any computer store. Be sure to follow the directions on the can, and do this only when the notebook is off.
<br /><br />Give It a Rest
<br />If you’re going to be working exclusively on AC power for a week or more, remove the battery first.
<br />Otherwise, you’ll be wearing out the battery–constantly charging and discharging it–at a time when you don’t need to use it at all. You’re also heating it up (see “Keep It Cool,” above).
<br /><br />By the way, if you forgot your bios password, it is helpful for you to take off the battery to regain access into it.  But if you <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS9mb3Jnb3Qtd2luZG93cy03LXBhc3N3b3JkLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">forgot Windows 7 password</a> or other kinds of  Windows OS, it is better to do <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS93aW5kb3dzLTctcGFzc3dvcmQtcmVjb3ZlcnkuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Windows 7 password recovery</a> with a  proven Windows password recovery tool.

A forgotten password sometimes brings you troubles, even disasters. Luckily, there always exits some approaches to recover or reset a forgotten password. Here’s a look at how to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS9yZXNldC13aW5kb3dzLTctcGFzc3dvcmQuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">reset Windows 7 password</a> with an installation disc.
<br /><br />You might have been told to use a password reset disk or another admin account to reset a forgotten Windows 7 password. But for most users, these are unless when they get the Windows password forgotten. The password reset disk must be created before your password is forgotten while most users forgot the only administrator password. If you are one of those users, please try to use your installation disc instead. Don’t have one? Still doesn’t matter. Rekeysoft Windows Password Recovery is always available.
<br /><br />Reset Windows 7 password with an installation disc
<br /><br />By using this method, all you need is a copy of the Windows installation disk and Sticky Keys trick (an accessibility feature that allows a user to tap the Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or Windows key once to achieve the same effect as holding the key down).
<br /><br />1. Boot your computer from the installation disc.
<br /><br />2. After loading the setup files, select your language and click Next -&gt; click the Repair your computer link on the Install Windows screen -&gt; select the operating system to repair and click Next -&gt; click Command Prompt to open a command prompt window.
<br /><br />3. On the command prompt, type “copy c:windowssystem32sethc.exe c:” and press Enter. And then type “copy /y c:windowssystem32cmd.exe c:windowssystem32sethc.exe” and press Enter.
<br /><br />4. Reboot the computer. On the logon screen, tap Shift five times and you’ll see an administrator mode command prompt.
<br /><br />5. Now you can reset the password. Just type “net user MyUserName MyNewPassword” (replace the MyUserName and MyUserPassword with the combination you want) and press Enter.
<br /><br />6. Exit the Command Prompt, and log into the computer using your new password.
<br /><br />Notes:
<br /><br />1. To prevent other users from using the same trick to reset your password, you put the original sethc.exe file back. Reboot your computer form the installation CD and then open the command prompt by taking steps above. Next type “copy /y c:sethc.exe c:windowssystem32sethc.exe” and press Enter.
<br /><br />2. By taking this method, you will lose access to encrypted files, encrypted email messages, and stored passwords for Internet Explorer and network resources. Remember to back up your important data regularly.

Remember, Vista. I forgot the password. I’m not looking to reset/change the password, but I’d like to know what the password is. Is there anyway to find this? If possible, I’d like to do this without creating another user.
<br /><br />Solution: Find Vista password using Windows Password Cracker
<br />Generally speaking, most lost Windows Vista password users prefer to use a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Rekeysoft Windows Password Recovery</a> to reset or change the lost password rather than to crack it as it’s more convenient and less time-consuming. But if you insist on cracking your lost Vista password, chances are still there as long as you can find a powerful Windows Vista password cracker. Here will recommend 2 free Windows password crackers for you.
<br /><br />1. Ophcrack
<br />Ophcrack is by far the most popular free Windows password cracker available. The program basically uses something called a Rainbow Table which will go through a list or dictionary of computer hashes and passwords trying to crack the password located in the Windows SAMs file (file containing all user passwords).
<br /><br />With Ophcrack, you don’t need any access to Windows to be able to recover your lost passwords. Simply visit the site, download the free ISO image, burn it to a CD and boot from the CD. The Ophcrack program starts, locates the Windows user accounts, and proceeds to recover (crack) the passwords – all automatically.
<br /><br />2. Cain &amp; Abel
<br />Cain &amp; Abel is a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbnlwYXNzd29yZHJlY292ZXJ5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Windows password recovery</a> tool for Microsoft operating systems. It allows easy recovery of various kinds of passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using dictionary and brute force attacks, decoding scrambled passwords, revealing password boxes, uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols.
<br /><br />1. Download a rainbow table before using Cain &amp; Abel.
<br /><br />2. Open the “Cain” program and then click on the Cracker tab.
<br /><br />3. On the left, click on the LM &amp; LTLM Hashes and then click the big blue plus sign on the Cain toolbar. Make sure the Import Hashes from local system radio button is checked and click Next. All the user accounts will be loaded to the right.
<br /><br />4. Right-click on the username you need the password for, choose Cryptanalysis Attack , LM Hashes, via RainbowTables.
<br /><br />5. In the LM Hashes cryptanalysis window, click the … button and choose the folder you extracted the free rainbow tables to.

<br /><br />Step 1. Open the User Accounts window by clicking Start button, Control Panel, Family Safety and User Accounts, User Accounts.
<br /><br />Step 2. Click on Create a password for your account link.
<br /><br />Step 3. Type your password, type your password again to confirm it, type password hint and then click the Create Password button.
<br />2. Create a password reset disk
