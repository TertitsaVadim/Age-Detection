However, considering the super lightweight of the wind jacket, I don’t think it would necessarily hurt me to carry it along to try out, but have my hard shell as a back up… we’ll see.)So, when I decided I would give it a go, I narrowed it down to 3 different wind jackets.Just by looking at the list, it seems the obvious winner would be the Stoic Wraith, however, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">cheap north face jackets</a> I decided against it mainly due to concerns about fit. I would have to order any of the above jackets off of the net, so trying them on first was out of the question, and it seems that the Stoic has had some issues with fit/sizing. I do have some Stoic clothing (socks and a Merino shirt) but with only one shirt, I am not so sure.Then there is the Patagonia. This wind shirt probably gets more votes from others than any of the listed 3. Just go to Backpacking Light and post about it and you will find many a happy users… This based on the fact that I love my own Patagonia items is enough to tell me that this jacket is a winner.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">north face jackets sale</a> But my hang up you ask? First off, it was the most expensive (however, any of the above mentioned jackets can be found for cheaper quite easily) but it is also the heaviest. I can get a silnylon rain jacket that only weighs 0.5 oz more than this and it is also water proof (granted not as breathable though).So, as evidenced by the title of this post, I went with the middle guy, the North Face Verto. Now, I will say that I know a lot of backpackers cannot stand TNF items, but hey, that is fine with me. As far as I am concerned, all of TNF clothing that I have had and used/still use, I have been happy with it. The fact that most everyone walking around town wears TNF doesn’t change this fact for me. So, now that that is out…Based on the price as well as my <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets on sale</a> past experiences with TNF items, I felt comfortable in going with this wind jacket. Also, I liked the fact that this jacket was listed at a full 1+ oz lighter than the Houdini (which was my 2nd choice). Now all I had to do was figure out which size and color I wanted… then, I placed my order through Zappos.com (because they have a free return policy). Then a few days later, the wind jacket was on my door step…So, as seen from the video, I went with the size Large, simply because the jacket appeared to have a baggy fit.

He informs me that there was a similar <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20vdGhlLW5vcnRoLWZhY2Utc2N5dGhlLWMtMjEuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">the north face scythe jacket</a> incident last year which he feels was due to a seal. This only effects an older type of Summit regulator and there should only be a small number in circulation.&quot;&quot;Neil has asked me to help to remove these from circulation. I suspect that most equipment will now be at BC or en-route. I am happy to help to resolve any issues and advise when I get there.&quot;&quot;Summit have promised to replace these regs with new ones being shipped out from UK end of April. Asian Trekking will get them to me and I will take care of any exchange required.&quot;&quot;I hope this eases discomfort about this situation.&quot;ExplorersWeb Is there a way for a climber to identify the older Summit regulator?Ted Atkins Yes, in the main body where it screws onto the cylinder there is a blanking plug. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets for men</a> This is not on the newer regs. I am going to Everest Base Camp to de-pressure the new Summit cylinders and while there Summit has asked me to help identify and quarantine the dangerous regulators.I am expecting a delivery of new Summit regulators to BC at the end of April and I can exchange 'old for new' then. I will be staying on at BC to climb Lhotse this season so will be around for the whole period if anyone has any oxygen issues they need help with.Meanwhile I re-iterate earlier advice which holds good as best practice at all times when handling pressure vessels:1. Connect the cylinder onto the regulator keeping the gauge facing the ground (the gauge is the weak link, exposed to the full pressure but with moving parts. It was the gauge on the 1st regulator incident that exploded. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">north face jackets sale</a> I had a piece pulled from my neck with pliers).2. Wear gloves (high pressure gas can enter the blood stream through the skin and is a known industrial danger. Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summits had his hand badly burnt in the second Kathmandu incident when the O2 ignited).3. Wear your ski goggles or other eye protection.Last week Ted Atkins was injured testing a Poisk regulator in conjunction with a new Summit cylinder, delivered as being higher pressure than the Poisk cylinders. The regulator that failed was not an old style nor was it the newest style. Having sold a number of these cylinders Ted felt obliged to inform all of a potential problem.Mingma Sherpa of Seven Summits was injured after the Summit regulator exploded while attaching it to a Poisk cylinder. &quot;This is different and potentially more serious that the previous accident as this was an ignition,&quot; Ted said.Trying to get on top of the situation, &quot;Please contact me if you have doubts or would like advice,&quot; Ted now urges users, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets for men</a> &quot;meanwhile please take the extra precautions we advised: fit cylinder to reg with the gauge down, wear goggles, wear gloves.&quot;An Aero Systems Engineering Officer working with the RAF Mountain Rescue Service Ted is known for his very popular Topout oxygen mask that he decided to build in 2004 after he ran out of oxygen on Everest and was saved by a Sherpa.

In the last couple of years the Germany based climber (Munich, Bavaria) successfully climbed 5 Eight-Thousand-Meter-Peaks in the Himalaya and Karakorum together with his wife, Alix von Melle: Cho Oyu 8201 m (2000 &amp;amp; 2010), Gasherbrum II 8035 m (2006), Nanga Parbat 8125 m (2008), Dhaulagiri 8167 m (2009) and Broad Peak 8051 m (2011) as well as attempted others, as Makalu to 8050 m (2010) <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets on sale</a> and K2 to 8000 m (2011). Stitzinger had successfully skied some of these peaks (Gasherbrum II, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, K2) on the descent and In the report released today by Montana attorney general no criminal wrongdoing was found in the investigation of Greg Mortenson.CAI's mission is reportedly good and its financial situation is strong, said the report. CAI took in $72 million in donations from 2003-2011 and still has more than $23 million in reserves.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">cheap north face jackets</a> Unable to verify all his expenses, a settlement agreement has been reached calling for Mortenson to reimburse CAI $980,000. He has three years to repay the balance because he lacks financial resources to pay it all back at once.The report said Mortenson had little aptitude for record keeping or personnel management, and CAI needs better oversight so one person does not hold too much control. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">north face jackets sale</a> Greg is therefore sacked as executive director and voting member of the board of directors and the charity must expand its board from three to seven members. The two current board members must step down after a year. AP said Krakauer was unhappy with the fact that no outside entity has legal authority to contest any of the individuals to be appointed.The charity said it still needs Greg to continue speaking engagements and build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan. For this, he will get a salary.

In it, he said that Baltimore, where he was born, raised and started his career “has desperately tried to stay relevant, with mixed results, in the geographic cleavage between Washington and Philadelphia.”That was interesting to me not just because of the use of the word cleavage, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets on sale</a>  but because I never realized people from Baltimore felt their city was overlooked because it’s located between Philadelphia and Washington.Of course, the reason I never realized it is because I, like virtually every other Philadelphia-area resident, have spent so much time feeling Philadelphia is overlooked because it’s between New York and Washington.What, you may wonder, does this have to do with Kentucky? Well, I lived in Indianapolis for six years, from 1992 through 1998. And one of the first things I found out after I moved there was that Hoosiers considered Kentucky residents to be backwards hillbillies. Their sentiments were best expressed in the joke, “What do a tornado and a Kentucky divorce have in common? Both mean someone’s going to lose a trailer.”A few years later, however, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGZhY2VqYWNrZXRzYWxlNHlvdS5jb20v" target="_blank">the north face jackets for women</a> I found out that Illinois residents, especially from the part of the Land of Lincoln around Chicago, had similar feelings towards Hoosiers. In fact, they told the same joke, but with a different beginning: “What do a tornado and an Indiana divorce have in common?”
