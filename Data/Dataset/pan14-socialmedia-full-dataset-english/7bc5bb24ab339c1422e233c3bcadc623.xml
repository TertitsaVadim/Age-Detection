<br />hired at The Tickle Me Elmo factory and she reports for her first day promptly at 8:00 AM.
<br />The next day at 8:45 AM there is a knock at the Personnel Manager's door. The Foreman throws open the door and begins to rant about the new employee. He complains that she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up, putting the entire production line behind schedule.
<br />The Personnel Manager decides he should see this for himself, so the 2 men march down to the factory floor.
<br />When they get there the line is so backed up that there are Tickle Me Elmo's all over the factory floor and they're really beginning to pile up.
<br />At the end of the line stands Lena surrounded by mountains of Tickle Me Elmo's. She has a roll of plush red fabric and a huge bag of small marbles. The 2 men watch in amazement as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and begins to carefully sew the
<br />little package between Elmo's legs.The Personnel Manager bursts into laughter.
<br />After several minutes of hysterics he pulls himself together and approaches Lena. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says to her, barely able to keep a
<br />straight face, but I think you misunderstood the instructions I gave you yesterday.....&quot; &quot;Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles&quot;.
<br /><br />If you don't send this to five friends right away, there will be five fewer people laughing in the world!

<br /><br />He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:
<br /><br />&quot;Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He's probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, just do it, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you.&quot;
<br /><br />To which his wife responds: &quot;He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay! He thinks you are cute, and asked me if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!&quot;

Its just not fuckin right! the only baby killers out there are the sick fuckers who regard what thier doing as the right of islam, when they put explosives on school buses or in hospitals! And we're the sick ones??!! They kill more of thier own people than all the armed forces of every nation that is out there!! There are too many people out there who are so quick to judge, but forget that without the service men and women from all the allied countries, places like iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo and such would still be in complete ruins! Our soldiers dont just go out there to fight, but to help the people of these countries start to rebuild there lives, thier homes, their medical facilities and thier governments, and help them to become fully functioning countries again. Our soldiers work relentlessly with humillity and in great adversity, in hostile situations so that these people can once again call themselves independant nations! And they do all this despite being thousands of miles away from home, family and friends, and still they hold thier heads up high, and so they should!! 
<br />Thank you to all those who support our troops, and to all those who have served and are still doing so, and to all those who have given there lives, I salute you for you truely are HEROS!!
