<br />If you're ugly,
<br />stop acting like you don't know it.
<br />The captions under you picture that says
<br />&quot;top model pose&quot;
<br />&quot;sexy bitch&quot;
<br />&quot;arnt i hot&quot;
<br />doesn't convince anyone.
<br /><br />two.
<br />To the people who have like 25,000 friends,
<br />are you serious?
<br />Nobody in this universe can keep up with that many friends.
<br />You're stupid.
<br />Go play in traffic.
<br /><br />three.
<br />Don't ever post pictures and say
<br />&quot;OMG, I'm so ugly&quot;
<br />&quot;OMG,I'm so fat&quot;
<br />because if you were,
<br />you wouldn't post them.
<br /><br />four.
<br />Nobody cares about threats over the internet.
<br />Don't try to act hardcore with the keyboard.
<br />Fighting online is like racing in the special olympics;
<br />even if you win,
<br />you're still retarded.
<br /><br />five.
<br />Making 20 bulletins a day
<br />about how you have new pictures
<br />and begging people to comment on them is pathetic.
<br />Make the bulletin once if you have to,
<br />and those who actually care about you
<br />will comment on your pics.
<br /><br />six.
<br />If all your pictures look the same,
<br />don't post them all.
<br />Please put some variety in your pics.
<br />Nobody wants to see your face
<br />8 different ways.
<br /><br />seven.
<br />Who really cares if
<br />I don't accept you as a friend?
<br />MOVE ON!!!
<br />Don't send me another request or message asking
<br />&quot;what's up with you not adding me?&quot;
<br />I don't want you as a friend;
<br />that's what's up!
<br /><br />eight.
<br />Little 6th graders that
<br /> look like sluts,
<br />go somewhere else
<br />because nobody wants you here.!!!
<br /><br />nine.
<br /><br />If you have decided to read this,
<br />you are a true Friend.
<br />Real friends read their bulletins.
<br /><br />ten.
<br />I say you go and pass this on
<br />and maybe it will finally get through people's brains
<br />(if they have them).
<br /><br />eleven.
<br />And if you open a msg and it says something like
<br />&quot;repost this in 100 seconds or a ghost will rape your dog tonight,&quot;
<br />IT'S NOT REAL!
<br />QUIT BEING AN IDIOT!!!!!!!!
<br />PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO LIFE WHATSOEVER MAKE THAT SHIT UP THINKING THAT PEOPLE WILL FALL FOR THEIR STUPID TRAP!!! AND YOU DO!!

<br /><br />I'm talking about hide and seek/spotlight in the park. The corner dairy,hopscotch, four square, go carts, cricket in front of the garbage bin and inviting everyone on your street to join in, skipping (doubledutch), gutterball, handstands, elastics, bullrush, catch and kiss,footy on the best lawn in the street, slip'n'slides, the trampoline withwater on it (or a sprinkler under it), hula hoops, jumping in puddles with gumboots on, mud pies and building dams in the gutter.
<br /><br />The smell ofthe sun and fresh cut grass. 'Big bubbles no troubles' with Hubba Bubba bubble gum. A topsy. Mr Whippy cones on a warm summer night after you've chased him round the block. 20 cents worth of mixed lollies lasted a week and pretending to smoke &quot;fags&quot; (the lollies) was really cool!.. A dollars' worth of chips from the corner take-away fed two people (AND the sauce was free!!).
<br /><br />Being upset when you botched putting on the temporary tattoo from the bubble gum packet, but still wearing it proudly. 
<br /><br />Watching Saturdaymorning cartoons: 'The Smurfs', 'AstroBoy', 'He-man', 'Captain Caveman', 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', 'Jem' (trulyoutrageous!!), 'Super d'',and 'Heeeey heeeeey heeeeeeey it's faaaaaaat Albert'. Or staying up lateand sneaking a look at the &quot;AO&quot; on the second telly, being amazed when you watched TV right up until the 'Goodnight Kiwi!' When After School with Jason Gunn &amp; Thingie had a cult following andWhat Now was on saturday mornings!
<br /><br />When around the corner seemed a long way, and going into town seemed like going somewhere. Where running awaymeant you did laps of the block because you weren't allowed to crossthe road?? A million mozzie bites, wasp and bee stings (stee bings!). Sticky fingers, goodies &amp; baddies, cops and robbers, cowboys andindians, riding bikes til the street lights came on and catching tadpoles in horse troughs. Going down to the school swimming pool when you didn't have a key and your friends letting you in, drawing all over the road and driveway withchalk.
<br /><br />Climbing trees and building huts out of every sheet your mum had in the cupboard (and never putting them back folded). Walking to school in bare feet, no matter what the weather. When writing 'I love....? on your pencil case, really did mean it was true love. &quot;he loves me? he loves me not?&quot; and daisy chains on thefront lawn. Stealing other people's flowers from their gardens and then selling them back to them... 
<br /><br />Running till you were out of breath. Laughing so hard that your stomach hurt. Pitching the tent in the back/front yard (and never being able to find all the pegs). Jumping on the bed. Singing into your hair brush in front of the mirror, making mix tapes... 
<br /><br />Sleep overs and ghosts stories with the next door neighbours. Pillowfights, spinning round, getting dizzy and falling down was causefor the giggles. The worst embarrassment was being picked last for ateam. Water balloons were the ultimate weapon. Weetbix cards pegged onthe spokes transformed any bike into a motorcycle. Collecting WWF and garbage pail kids cards. 
<br /><br />Eating raw jelly and raro, making homemade lemonade and sucking on a Rad, a traffic light popsicle, or a Paddle Pop... blurple, yollange andprink! Traffic Light drinks at Cobb'n'Co! You knew everyone in your street - and so did your parents! It wasn't odd to have two or three &quot;best friends&quot; and you would ask them by sending a note asking them to be your best friend. You didn't sleep a wink on Christmas eve and tried (and failed) to waitup for the tooth fairy.
<br /><br />When 50c was decent pocket money. When you'dreach into a muddy gutter for 10c. When nearly everyone's mum was there when the kids got home fromschool. It was magic when dad would &quot;remove&quot; his thumb. When it was considered a great privilege to be taken out to dinner atthe local Chinese restaurant (or Cobb'n'Co.) with your family. 
<br /><br />When any parent could discipline any kid, or feed her or use him to carry groceries and nobody, not even the kid, thought a thing of it. When being sent to the principal's office was nothing compared to thefate that awaited a misbehaving student at home. Basically, we were in fear for our lives, but it wasn't because of drive-by shootings, drugs, gangs, etc. Our parents and grandparents werea much bigger threat! Some of us are still afraid of them!!! 
<br /><br />Remember when decisions were made by going &quot;eeny-meeny-miney-mo&quot; or dibdib's-scissors, paper, rock. &quot;Race issue&quot; meant arguing about who ranthe fastest. Money issues were handled by whoever was the banker in Monopoly. Terrorism was when the older kids were at the end of your street withpea-shooters waiting to ambush you, or the neighbourhood rottie chased you up a tree!
<br /><br />The worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was boy/girl germs, and the worst thing in your day was having to sit next to one.Where bluelight disco's were the equivalent to a Rave, and asking a boy out meant writing a 'polite' note getting them to tick 'yes' or 'no'.When there was always that one 'HOT' guy/girl. 
<br /><br />Having a weapon in school meant being caught with a slingshot. Yourbiggest danger at school was accidentally walking through the middle of a heated game of &quot;brandies&quot; or &quot;slaps.&quot; 
<br /><br />Birthday beats meant you didn't want to go to school on your birthday!
<br /><br />Scrapes and bruises were kissed and made better. Taking drugs meant scoffing orange-flavoured chewable vitamin C's, or swallowing half a Panadol. Ice cream was considered a basic food group. Going to thebeach and catching a wave was a dream come true. Boogie boarding in the white wash made you the next Kelly Slater. Abilities were discovered because of a &quot;double- dare&quot;. 
<br /><br />Older siblings were the worst tormentors, but also the fiercest protectors. 
<br /><br />Now, didn't that bring back some fond memories?? If you can remember most of these, you're a Kiwi legend!!!

<br /><br />&quot;When you graduate from college, no one is going to care where you went to college. If they do care, you donâ€™t want to work for that boss.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;When all is said and done, the only change that will make a difference is the transformation of your self.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then, do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Loneliness is an island in the middle of a sea of people.&quot;

Work, bills, school everything drops away and the only thing going thought your mind is the next move or cheering on your mates. The people are also great, in what other sport can you met someone and 5mins later youâ€™re trusting them with your life, met people from all over the world and all deferent walks of life. Even though itâ€™s an individual sport the scents of companionship and the way you could be competing in a comp and youâ€™re competitors are cheering you on rivals any team sport Iâ€™ve played.So go rock climbing!

<br />When light up sneakers were COOL. 
<br />When you rented videos, not DVDs.
