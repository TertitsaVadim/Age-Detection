The summer season circuit comes to a prevent at the initial-ever Maloof Money Cup contest in Washington D.C. held on Labor Day Weekend. The tour’s final 4 cities are Birmingham, Miami, Atlanta and Philadelphia.<br /><br />The Maloof Road Tour works with and encourages community skate stores in each town to host skateboarding contests (High Ollie, Game of Skate, Best Line contests and more) on Saturdays at just about every city of the circuit. The winners of the Best Line competitions through Aug. 14 will be taken to Vegas for MAGIC (Aug 22-23), the style industry’s most significant trade show where they will contend on a custom built course on the exhibit flooring for a chance at $5,000 dollars.<br /><br />“Through the Road Tour, we wanted to promote the local community skate shops,” said Tim McFerran, General Manager of Maloof <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maloofmoneycup.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.maloofmoneycup.com</a>. “They are the lifeblood of the industry and it’s thanks to them and our amazing partners Vans, vitaminwater and Skull Candy for making the tour possible. The most important part of this tour has been the Community Service Sundays that give the skateboarding community the chance to become involved and make a difference. We have had thousands of kids volunteer their time for service projects on tour Sundays. Projects like skate park cleanup, graffiti removal, skate gear drives and riverbed cleanup are often lacking in funding. Having the kids get involved will, we hope, be something that inspires them to become engaged and active members of their communities.”<br /><br />Final Maloof Road Tour Dates/Towns<br /><br />· AUG 6-7: Birmingham<br />· AUG 13-14: Miami<br />· AUG 20-21: Atlanta, GA<br />· AUG 27-28: Philadelphia,PA<br /><br />The Maloof Road Tour headed out June 11 in Chicago and has traveled to Kansas City, Denver, Vegas, Sacramento, Vancouver, Dallas and Salt Lake City.

Because of this, a lot of areas are unable to bring a course in.  That is why the Maloof Money Cup has grow to be a coveted function to cities all around the planet.  Alongside with throwing the remarkable skateboarding championships, the organization partners with Vans to fork up expense for a new skate park for every location they throw an competition. This year, they are up to four competition all-around the globe &amp; the upcoming location is in our nation’s capital, Washington DC!<br /><br />I’ve never been there, but I’m excited after reading through the plans of the park being built into the RFK Stadium Festival Grounds.  One of my all-time favorite pro <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maloofmoneycup.com%2Fskateboarding%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Bview%3Dsection%26amp%3Blayout%3Dblog%26amp%3Bid%3D13%26amp%3BItemid%3D216%26amp%3Blang%3Den"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.maloofmoneycup.com/skateboarding/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=216&amp;lang=en</a> &amp; all around excellent guy Geoff Rowley plays a key position in the design and style of each skate park they assemble &amp; he has this to say:<br /><br />“It was important for us to take design elements from real DC skate spots and try to replicate them and hopefully complement them as much as possible,” said Rowley.  “The local skaters will recognize some of these influences like the Freedom Plaza Ledges and the Golden Rail made famous by legendary locals like Pepe Martinez, Chris Hall and many more original DC rippers,” said Rowley. <br /><br />The park will be a fifteen thousand square-foot skate park and is the initial significant skate park in Washington, D.C. and is inspired by Freedom Plaza and the architecture up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.  Again, California Skateparks will be handling the construction and if it’s anything at all like the other Maloof Skate Parks, it must be top notch.<br /><br />On Labor Day weekend, I’ll be heading to check out the new park at the 6th Maloof Money Cup <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maloofmoneycup.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.maloofmoneycup.com</a>.  I guess there is no better way to break in a new skate park than to watch some of the very best pro skaters like Geoff Rowley, Greg Lutzka, Dennis Busenitz &amp; much more combating for the next $160,000 prize.
