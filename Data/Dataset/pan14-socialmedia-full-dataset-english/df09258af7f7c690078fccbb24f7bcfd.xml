The flap is then folded back to reveal the stroma - the center layer with the cornea. A large precision laser, called the excimer laser, is employed to reshape the corneal surface in order to correct any refractive error. The flap is then repositioned to act like a all-natural bandage. Because the microkeratome used to make a flap is the truth is a surgical blade, the process is also referred to as blade LASIK.<br /><br />A additional current innovation, launched in 1999, makes utilization of a high energy laser (IntraLase or femtosecond laser) to create a flap for the duration of surgical procedure. Rather than classic LASIK, IntraLase does not utilize a surgical blade, and hence the process is usually marketed as &quot;bladeless&quot; or &quot;all laser&quot; LASIK. The phrase itself has raged a discussion amongst eye surgeons, concerning whether it needs to be applied in IntraLase ads or not. A number of surgeons assert the term &quot;bladeless&quot; implies that conventional LASIK, which tends to make utilization of a surgical blade (microkeratome), is often a scarier proposition, when in reality it&quot;s not.<br /><br />The development of the flap is definitely an significant portion with the laser eye surgical procedure procedure. It&quot;s correct that flap predictability is much better with a laser flap, that is, with bladeless LASIK.

However, an expert surgeon wielding a modern microkeratome can extremely well match the finesse of bladeless LASIK. Even though the probabilities are rare, there is an issue of transient light sensitivity too - a one of a kind threat related to bladeless LASIK. Furthermore, the bladeless LASIK process fees an extra $300 per eye, when in comparison with standard LASIK.<br /><br />All mentioned and completed, LASIK itself is among the most secure refractive surgical treatment process. Irrespective of whether it&quot;s blade or bladeless, it largely depends on the eye surgeon of the choice. When the surgeon has tons of experience carrying out microkeratome methods, it&quot;s greater to have it <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYW51Y2tzamVyc2V5c3Nob3AuY29tL2FsZXhhbmRyZS1idXJyb3dzLWplcnNleQ__" target="_blank">Alexandre Burrows Jersey</a> like that.
