<br /><br />I put down my feelings often to get my thoughts in order , or for hubby / family to read so we all know how things are and that were ok.
<br />so heres an update 
<br />Well hubby went out &quot; bird watchin&quot; yesterday with the close relative whos been diagnosed as terminally ill.
<br />We have some beautiful  stunning places here of natural beauty  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":)" /> worth exsploring 
<br />I thought hard about it but this time ... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/innocent.gif" alt=":)" /> I didnt go. 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" />Thought it would be better for hubby to do the bond thing .  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Would be good to help them both have a chat ,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" />relax and wind down , 
<br />have some quality time together.
<br /><br />Thought it worked to but hubby was real quiet when he got in , ate his meal did his &quot;thing&quot; and generally was a bit to quiet for normal.
<br /> I guess its the mental as well as physical stress of the day that was the real  drain.
<br />Offered some advise, passed a few comments , and then we settled down  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />for the back end of gremlins 2 
<br />( he didnt really smile once.
<br /> I said nothing............
<br /><br />We cuddled up for a while in front of the telly and talked very little.
<br />Then!! I had the shock of my life I swear....!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We had the Cranwell thing on and hubby let out such a bone shaking bellow.
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> I looked <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> at his comments and I'm sorry he was spot on.
<br />its absolutely true  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I defy any sane person to deny it 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Dawn Frenches chest really does  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />&quot;Ripple like a water bed&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I think shes funny anyway but in a tight corset  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So Dawn French if your (Not that you would be but)  reading this 
<br />Thanks You helped wind down a really difficult day with a smile . 
<br />And if anyone else reads this shes a fav comedian of mine now ...even more so .
<br /><br />Have a great day and may all your smiles be from the heart. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />And NO its NOT because hubby is  far to  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> although  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> we  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> have our moments  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> like anyone else I guess. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> We recently traveled several hundred miles to a meeting I really didnt want to go to  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" /> up early and long long day out . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />I thought we'd have a fallout but no things went well . I find I'm NOT as intimidated by those in my history  as I used to be, truth is unlike those I used to put my trust in  I DONT  recieve a bruise,fat lip, or loss of teeth these days I'm allowed to say my mind , (  hubby treats me with the mutual respect I show him and it works well so its NOTHING like a past relationship )  I know I'm a bit emotional when it comes to those around me that I love , but I'm rarely disrespectful, usually a bit scatterbrained  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> if I'm completely honest.I found out simply by doing the voluntary stuff thats actually a sideline of a trauma  or tramatic background.But my hearts in the right place as they say, and I'm a passionate   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" /> parent when it comes to my kids safety. 
<br />And THATS as they say  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" /> is how it should be. Made such a change to actually hear my ex praise one of my children I know he did it purely for effect, and secretly he must have been heaving to have felt he had to say it lol but I was proud just the same. I only wish my son could have heard him it might have made him smile.
<br /><br />I stayed home today alot to do I was going to buy on a guitar online but I figure its prob better if I get one sold as seen so to speak.
<br />Tommorrow I have to go to another one of those family get togethers. Not really looking forward to it , I'm usually cheerful by nature and with his mum having heart probs, his sis in and out of hospital for somthing else, his dad terminally ill me hubby with his lack of sleep and patience I feel a little left out. As am  generally in good health . Me nephews will prob eat like its the last supper <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />its usually something indescribable and mass produced and dressed up to look like a quality meal with all the rubber ,and chemical enhancers complete with price tag, and I prob will have a half glass , nibble the dinner, miss me pudding, (secretly longing for somthing not out of a freezer or packet) and come home to a bowl of crispies and bickies and cuppa tea as per usual. But I dont get to choose the venue so......<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />awe nothings simple. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> Ive tried to get out of it I really DONT want thanking for anything I do , it seems like its for face you know......
<br />( well the family get together is almost a command) .
<br /><br />But I will go because hubby asked me to . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" /> and he did escort me to this meeting so ..... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> snookered 
<br />Well going to ring my American friend now and see if shes ok , and if she needs anything . We have a good relationship , we used to work together in the same charity and shes lovely she reminds me how lucky I am and I remind her what happen's if you bargain hunt to much  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Have a gr8 night world and keep up the smiles  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Went around to the  &quot;mother in laws&quot; on fri  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> and shock of all shocks .... 
<br />SHE was nice  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I was there trying to help with some official stuff , cant say I'm any good at things like that but,
<br /> I went through it all with my own mum before she died so I  guess I should be getting the hang of this by now.
<br /> They had a fire few weeks ago so I did my hi..... yat thing wih blocks of crud the smashed them up for bags  to transport .
<br /> Was rather  funny my father in law helped hes struggling to come to terms with his illness 
<br />I guess hes realised hes terminal and it aint gonna get any better,
<br /> not the man he used to be by any means,
<br /> but he can be quite comical when he wants and I think it made him feel useful.
<br />I made my famous pancakes with home made coconut and choc chip ice cream , with maple syrup
<br /> and it was eaten with vigor that on its own was a suprise . 
<br />Mother in law normally cant cope with food so hardly eats bless her but... she manages two pancakes with NO waste. 
<br />What  nice supprise,
<br />She even thanked me.
<br /> Hubby rang in the afternoon as he was leaving work I cant help wondering if he was a bit worried that it would be handbags (or broom sticks ) at 10 paces .... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Also I went several hundred  miles recently  to a meeting  regarding other family and was promised
<br /> better comunication and more information .
<br /> But not ONLY did I have to complain about standards and lack of them from some one who IS supposed to be responsible ...
<br /><br />but I had made a official complaint at beginning of November and was promised &quot;swift&quot; action and STILL nothing.......
<br />What a disgrace.... 
<br />Then I get a letter of apology from a member at the meeting that DIDNT  as I presume couldnt attend , 
<br /> Only when I read the letter did I realise it was fairly stupid and pointless .....
<br /> As it said please find enclosed information regarding your family from this dept and hey NO paper, or 
<br /> letter attatched .
<br /> Kinda funny as I had a letter recently  from social services acknowledging my complaint regarding their ridiculous handling of my complaint at beginning of  November and asking me to fill in form with original complaint . Its NOW march for christ sake.!!!!!!
<br />Its a farce 
<br />NO form enclosed and NO return address envelope .
<br /><br />I feel sure they have to be deliberately  incompetent as I cant imagine any SANE professional failing to constantly perform the simplest of tasks with such continuity and disgraceful managment
<br /> of the tax payers money.
<br /><br />( I am starting to believe the saying)
<br /><br />(dont pull  your pants down last if the craps doin the rounds  )
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I dont want to  believe its the social worker dealing with the case for once I honestly hope this one is genuine and  will at least try what ever the circumstances and seems to be attempting to help with  the right thing for my family  
<br />( well I hope so).
<br />But it doesnt instill confidence in the system when its harder to see the good work accomplished 
<br />when theres obviously so much b/s and cloak and dagger stuff  present 
<br />Sorry But just like others I should be allowed an opinion to.
<br /> I often say &quot;hubby&quot; is a bit like victor meldrew  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />                                                             truth is
<br /> I think we all have the grumpy old person in us at some point  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />anyway enough ... 
<br /><br />have a great day  and keep up the smiles.... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />and it cant hurt every so often to get it off our chest now can it  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />good day 
<br />Now if your reading this &quot;blog&quot; and thinking bizzarre Join the club   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I'm a housewife with very few skills , a true heart but bit of a firm nose when it comes to what I want .
<br /> I have my old man to thank for that hes been an inspiration , although I strongly believe somtimes hes a bit to good hearted for his own good.( maybe THATS why I love him so much)  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> then again the choclate supply ,and the fantastic  trips out and  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> the fun aint so bad either.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So I was exspecting family to stay and was really looking forward to it actually, been informed Weeks in advance so I could plan ahead. ........... I rings up friday night and finds out my eldest boy hasnt bother to let me know hes been having motor probs and decided NOT to bother ...and as HE was fetching other family ......... All that shopping for nothing. Christ what was I thinking ...!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />darent tell my old man how much I spent to make last week &quot;special&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> although  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" /> I'm sure we could er...... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" /> make up on some level  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> I just get a bit  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" /> when I keep getting told they aint coming ...............!!!!
<br /> I know I live a hell of a drive away but I make the effort to see them I once traveled the length of the country through   London  then on to Glasgow to see my eldest, 
<br /> one poxy cuppa week tea  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" /> and a soggy dough nut  then 
<br />all the way back I got here at 2 in the morning because  I had managed to pick the worst flamin day of the year to travel by train , thunderstorms , powerlines down, flooding near Geordie. a detour through Northhampton I think it was and flooding there, 
<br />some NUT on the train had to be &quot;removed&quot; because he attacked someone
<br /> so the train manager had to be  effective!.
<br />I just feel a little let down .. Different story when its birthdays or Chrimbo ,
<br /><br />somtimes I hate it when hes right... I just wish he WOULDNT keep SAYING is all  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" />........
<br />.
<br />Anyway have been so busy here...
<br />.Been putting some house in order ,
<br />managed to drive through Norfolk to a deisel Gala
<br /> ( hubby was driving)
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> I heard the d.r.s. ages before it got to the platform , 
<br />and was funny exsplaining  that if you sat on the boards you could get the &quot;full &quot; effect 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Kinda  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> one of the seasoned engineers ( but I heard him  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> so much later describing our conversation he was almost  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> apparently not all wives will hold a conversation with the gang , but there just people the same as anyone else and I always feel welcome and apreciated for the little bit of help that I do ,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" /> its not alot I dont do trains ...., but its still ...... nice .
<br />Then blow me down on the way back I spots some road kill. 
<br /> I stuck my chin out and exsplained I was turning the motor round to inspect in the dark , one of the worst roads in Norfolk apparently for car accidents , but stuff it I was going to check it out so THERE......!
<br />To my absolute amazment 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />an absolutely  beautiful  young deer head on hit by a car i'd say .
<br /> He was so magnificant , lost one of his antlers and I think his neck had been broken as he was still warm ,
<br /> but nothing  we could do for him. 
<br />( he was a little boy we DID notice weve refered to  him  as Derek the deaded deer) .
<br />really sad to see such a fine specimen of nature so swiftly ended but on a brighter note .......
<br /><br />. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />its the closest Id ever been to a real deer , used to stop at Thetford forest and admire them at  a distance even pulled the camper van up and sat quietly for hours in the early morning mist  and watched them from a distance and that was lovely , but to actually see one so close . just wish hed have been 
<br />alive and kicking such a terrible waste , a swift death, and so pointless..
<br />but there you go as they say anyway thought I'd put somthing down in my blog as Ive kind of neglected this for a while so busy and so little time...
<br />all the best and keep smiling

<br /><br />since I moved away few years ago 
<br />, got married ,
<br /> changed my life 
<br /> ( for the better I might add)
<br />seems like my older kids who SHOULD be constructive ,
<br /> inteligent human beings seem to be struggling to cope with everyday life , bills , work.
<br /><br />Now I admit I failed as a parent ,
<br /> then be honest what parent no matter how much we love our kids ,
<br />fail on some subject , some level . 
<br />Of course most of us try , but......... 
<br /><br />Hey some kids should come with a govenment &quot;health&quot; warning stuck to their arse ..! 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />but it dosent stop us loving them a any less but 
<br />were NOT superhuman we just do our best.
<br />Now my oldest in her twenties ,
<br />feels like has  been sending me nasty little emails for months .
<br />Seems my ex has been having fun with her brothers and playing each of them off .
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I cant keep denying stuff it makes me look like I'm being dishonest  so....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> I do the best
<br /> I can keep telling the truth.
<br />I'm a firm believer in the truth always coming out in the end so  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I just wait.and KEEP telling the truth WHEN i'm asked.
<br />They werent raised as complete morons after all.
<br /><br />Back to the blog
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/book.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />She sends me the nasty insulting email so.. I telephone  her mobile.
<br />Aparrently lifes real bad and guess what shes been hiding the truth from me for ages , 
<br />didnt want to tell me I guess 
<br /><br />thinking I DIDNT CARE..... 
<br />I on the other hand ...
<br />just....  let her get on with stuff 
<br />( shes in her 20's for christ sake) 
<br />I figure she needs me she'll say.
<br /><br />It all comes out shes sobbin and moaning down the telephone 
<br />What can I do I cant buy her a house I cant get her a job.
<br /> I offers advice and options 
<br /><br />dont want her saying I'm trying to get her to move in
<br /> but we have a spare bed room and we'll help her get on her feet and and help her get her own place.
<br />My husband is Not her  father 
<br />and wouldnt want to take his place though if I'm honest 
<br />her father turned out to be one of lifes real disapointments 
<br />.If I hadnt been pushed into keeping a relationship by my own mother 
<br />( bless her she was very much old school shes now pushing up the daisys)
<br /> Id have kept most of my own teeth,
<br /> not recieved my lovely spinal injury amongst other gifts of temper  ,
<br /> and quiet frankly would have not been the person I am today .
<br /><br />I sit and what discussions on the tv about wife , husband abuse, 
<br /><br />THEY dont know the half of it. 
<br /><br />But I'm lucky this is my third relationship 
<br />and my hubby would chop his arms off rather than intentionally harm me ..
<br /><br />(he knows when hes onto a good thing lol )
<br /><br />Ive learnt so much in the last few years , 
<br />and the person that I see in the mirror is nothing like the soul destroyed person
<br /> I was shaped to be.
<br />Unfortunately with outside  interference my kids cant say the same.
<br /> My daughter struggles making choices , 
<br />and for all her intelligence just cant cope well looking after herself.
<br />It breaks my heart but ..
<br /><br />So I had this long chat and  advised ,
<br /> even said if things ARE THAT BAD.
<br /> I can see what jobs are down here and exstend your options ,
<br /> shes quite beautiful when she tries, artistic , talented, inteligent , ,caring, 
<br />and real smart when she is mind set on computing.
<br />Only things she lacks
<br /> ( sorry love if your reading this) 
<br />is confidence in herself and some decent self esteme.!
<br /> I should know I recognise the symtoms all to well ..
<br /><br />So I print off the c,v she sent me and goes round the place she says she wants to transfer to , 
<br />theres a vacancy.....!
<br /> I speak to the staff here at the job place and get some great advice .
<br /> All because she tells me 
<br /><br />THATS WHAT SHE WANTS.
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />THEN....
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />she dont answer her mobile, dont replied to my emails , I have job here lined up.
<br /> and all I can think is 
<br /> was I being wound up? 
<br /> I wont lie I would like to know shes ok,
<br /> I know we can help her,
<br />Things would be better but 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" /> I made it clear she would have to work, respect my husbands wishs 
<br />he lives here to 
<br />and ,,,, 
<br />be responsible
<br /><br />Trouble is I know she cant cope but shes in her 20's not a child , another year old shortly , 
<br />heres my ponder 
<br />When the hell does a parent stop being a parent , 
<br />part of me wants to go scoop her up and collect her 
<br />DEMAND 
<br /> she sort her life out 
<br />the other part of me says at THAT age I'd had 5 pregnancies ............
<br />two had survived.
<br /> my own home,
<br />responsibilities 
<br />  and an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, 
<br />pride in myself, 
<br />and some hope.
<br />We had imigrants in my day to so I find it hard to believe theres absolutely no jobs at all left.....
<br />it may well be harder to find work easier but.....
<br /><br />SORRY......
<br /><br />In this world nothings going to run smooth, perfect or slot into place 
<br />Look at the lottery  been going years and the &quot;big&quot; wins still never happened 
<br />prob never will 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> But you have a go keep trying , carry on 
<br />blessings come in various ways .
<br /> I'm hoping to go to the &quot;ideal home exhibition &quot; 
<br />if NEVER been 
<br />if hubby gets tickets be lovely but
<br /> They may all be gone for the day he has off.
<br />He may get called into work,
<br />things happen 
<br />I am hopeful , and to anyone reading this blog , we have that 
<br />hope , it kept me going all these years and just for that split second before the lotterys drawn 
<br />the sensation 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />the anticipation
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />already to jump for joy or head to the waste paper bin 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Lifes like that ...... 
<br />just enjoy it ....
<br /> its far to short .. 
<br />and make the most of today ......
<br /><br />Tommorows always somthing else 
<br /><br />best wishes world 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> keep up the smiles

<br /><br />I was really REALLY looking forward to day  in London with his nibs .
<br />Been feeling uncomfortable but like most people I get  &quot;off&quot; days so 
<br />I put my tummy upset  down to that .
<br /><br />EVERYone gets off days right?
<br /><br />We trundle off on the train , underground and have a really good day out.
<br />Hubby took me around Covent garden then all the stalls in the Ideal Home Exhibition .
<br />we got to enjoy all the sights ( well we'd NEVER  been before)  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />ok the Cambridge Oxford boat race was on same day and we had planned to go again this year but.
<br /> the tickets his nibs had got for 
<br />The ideal Home Exhibition was for sat as this was his ONLY day off  .....
<br /> finally...... having a day out together was ....an almost miricle .........lovely.
<br /><br />I guess he knew somthing was wrong when I  was too far too quiet 
<br />I'm normally a bubbly fun giggly  person and er.... I was certainly not that  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We bought a carrier bag full of prime exspensive sausages ( a rare treat ),
<br /> some varieties of elite cheeses ( that should keep him sweet),
<br /> got some freebies ,  and I got to see a side of life I never dreamed exsisted .
<br /><br />OUCH....I felt like I was going to give birth....! But I'm NOT pregnant so...? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We went through part of London by foot and once again he took me to the street of a thousand guitars .
<br /><br />By this point I was having trouble walking 
<br /> OUCH!    OUCH! 
<br /><br />He was shocked he was going to buy me that guitar he promised 
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I couldnt care less......
<br /><br />did he realise it was getting worse ?
<br />Told him I had a headache and felt sick  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sick.gif" alt=":)" /> well that was true 
<br />What I didnt say was I had tremendous backache , tummy cramps <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We walked more and his nibs bought somthing for his camera and we decided to go home
<br />By this time I was nearly in tears .......and my shields were starting to crumble.
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"> I....... H.U.R.T!</span>
<br /><br />When we got to the main train terminal to come back Hubby decided he would get me a supprise 
<br />a thankyou for the day out I guess.
<br /><br />He walks off and I stand by the bags and he saunters back with this smile on his face, 
<br />Behind his back was a whoppin gert   bouquet of flowers .
<br />by this time I'm  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />soon turned to  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> when I thought he wasnt looking 
<br />On the train back I was quiet , He kept  looking   at me so
<br />I pretended to be dosing off 
<br />I figure if I keep my sunglasses on he wont see the leaky eyes 
<br /> I didnt want to spoil today I couldnt ...! 
<br />HE NEVER BUYS ME FLOWERS  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We get home and I anounces I'm to tired for the pub got a headache ( well us girls get them)
<br /> so off he trundles and goes to pub to see his mates and a pint a beer.
<br /><br />He gets home and I pretend I was asleep 
<br />didnt want another confrontation about me ailments so....
<br />he goes to bed and I spend the rest of the night &quot;hurting&quot;
<br /><br />By three Sun morning I really REALLY hurt, 
<br />passed out 1st time, woke up about 4.12 am pass out with pain again,  OWWWWWWWWEEE
<br /><br />Get to just after 7am and I dont care how many kids I had I can take no more!!!!! 
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I telephone the emergancy team and ask PLEASE....... can they recomend a pill 
<br /><br />I left a contact number and I was instructed to go straight to the clinic..
<br /> I was trying to find the map of this place when the tel rang back 
<br /><br />By this time I was NOT  a happy bunny ....
<br />Hubby shot upright ran down stairs to see me holding on to the ironing board 
<br />Christ this REALLY hurt.
<br /><br />He speaks to the lady on the tel and rushes to get dressed .
<br /> I NEVER usually complain , 
<br />He was supposed to be on nights HE needed to sleep .
<br /><br />We walked to the clinic NO way was I driving 
<br />when I went into spasm what happened if I killed somone.?
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> we walked 
<br />straight in to see the doctor, THEN some more doctors  came in and had a good old fumble and natter ,
<br />Aparrently while I was being examined I actually said when asked 
<br /><br />&quot;help yourself love&quot;
<br />&quot; I'm selling tickets later&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I dont remember 
<br />The docs rang hospital I was going in .......by this time Hubby looked worse than me ....
<br /> Poor darling 
<br /><br />We get rushed to the hospital and straight to my own room , 
<br />Here come the rubber gloves again blimey that hurt.
<br />All I could think was thank god the kids didnt see me like this I 'm scared enough .
<br /><br />I was prodded and examined , discussed , and investigated historically 
<br /> I was given morphine , put on a drips, given pills , and instructions and passed into spasmodic sleep land.
<br />The last thing I can remember was telling my hubby at least the kids wont worry . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Poor darling he hardly left my side 
<br /><br />Well I had x rays , scanned, did the wee thing .
<br /> I went to sleep and woke up cold , I had managed to pull out the drips from one of my arms and when I put the light on I had managed to soak and spray my face, chest, bed, bedcloths, floor, dripstand, window ,cupboard, blimey I felt really lightheaded ... I rang for a nurse , 
<br />then seemed to slipped back into sleep almost imediately . 
<br />I seemed  fine when I woke up some time later ..
<br /><br />Funny thing  I'm on the mend, sleeping to much, trying to down at least 2 to 3 litres of fluid every day .
<br />I got pills and medcine to finish . And hubby back at work and watchin me like hawk , I'm not allowed to get stressed at min 
<br /> apparently that was half the problem I been worrying to much bout my kids..
<br /><br />I got a bit upset with one tel call to one of my kids and I passed the tel to my hubby , 
<br />Hes not his biological father 
<br />but he genuinely loves and cares for my family 
<br />and tried to be supportive and understanding .
<br />He dosent lie or decieve any of us and I have the greatest respect for all we've put him through.
<br />However when I passed the tel the 1st thing hubby said was.;..
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" /> DONT UPSET YOU MOTHER SHES ONLY WORRIED FOR YOU AND ....
<br /><br />SHES JUST OUTA HOSPITAL 
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I then had to tel the other kids so they didnt leave work and / or panic and think I was dying .....
<br /><br />Thing is I now know I should have been to the docs sooner.
<br />I made an apointment for the day after I ended up in hospital, 
<br /><br />But you cant get a check up unless its weeks in advance 
<br />and EVEN then 
<br />Had to cancel  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> I was indesposed  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But I always worry I'll get to the docs and  its just back pain,,,,,,,, I got a tummy bug,,,,,,,, its gas,,,,,,,,,,, !
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />You know nothing worse than some one complaining for nothing.
<br /> I've learned I had a simple  untreated I.B.S. attack  ok it was nasty  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I had let it get way out of hand by not relaxing but , been running round and worrying about family .
<br />The lesson I have learnt is simple ......
<br />Take time out for me ...... I need to start doing that and its still hard.
<br /><br />I hope whoever reads this dosent have to learn that lesson for themselves the way I learnt ..
<br />And a big thankyou to all the nurses and doctors that helped me back on the mend 
<br />All the best world and have a nice day  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Lets see went to see the Dianna memorial in Hyde Park recently with hubby and 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> it SUCKS!! 
<br />and I said so  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" /> what a waste of dosh!! 
<br />Disgraceful to think THATS supposed to be an accolade to a supposed to be &quot;honoured &quot; member of our countries royalty 
<br />Sorry but its basically an &quot;arty farty&quot;  leaky skate park! 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> my opinion of which I am entitled !
<br />Even the wildlife seemed to avoid it .
<br /><br />Now I'm certainly NOT  a royalist but come on  the girl must have been worth a bit more than that in the family gardens! Not like they couldn’t afford it .
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But then what do I know .
<br />Hubby took me for a jaunt round the big city 1st time we had a day out after we got married and I thought old queeny should have washed her windows EVEN THEN..! they were a disgrace . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />Less parties and bling, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> I say 
<br />Get your housework done mrs  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />You can afford it!!!!!
<br /><br />Been pottering in Garden I'm kinda on a promise not to get stressed or upset with family stuff . 
<br /><br />Had a real supprise recently was in town when I bumped into somone who apparently has been looking for me for a while just to tell me how things are now and to say &quot;thankyou&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br />lady used to come into a charity shop I work in as I was alone and noticed several times before somthing was wrong I happened to mention how she reminded me of me alot from years ago . 
<br />The way she wore sunglasses what ever the weather, the way she was too&quot;shy&quot; and seemed to flinch, far to nervous... you know ....
<br />Since the shop at the time had been empty it was raining and a dead  end afternoon !
<br />It was like opening a waterfall. I had seen the marks and bruises , she was in tears ....I had made her a cuppa at the time and we ended up having a chat and one thing led to another . She had decided to change her life , I think the fact I was in a better place in my life now made her look back on her own.
<br />Now I certainly wont go into details and I had asked questions that make people think silly stuff you know.
<br /><br />like  if you werent emotionally involved and you just met or  looked at yourself and offered advice on what you saw what would you say ?
<br />Well Not my place to interfer now is it. And the charity isnt THAT kinda rescue  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Hadnt seen her in christ ages ...! and ages ...! 
<br />Anyway she ran up to me and insisted I at least let her buy me a coffee .
<br />Quite a chat we had actually. and the cream cake was enourmous  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> and so dam messy !
<br />Aparently shes moved quite a ways , married a lovely man , hes alot like mine aparently <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Only much much RICHER  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> (cheeky sod) 
<br />Shes very happy and she looked incredable . and I dont just mean the clothes and &quot;bling&quot; either .
<br />So much more confident and she didnt sit or even stand the same.
<br />I'm sure its not just down to me maybe the fact that I told her how much I regretted tolerating situations which we were forced into just so that as a family we could stay together . 
<br />Truth is looking back I was allowing horrible times because I was so scared
<br /> the alternative would be far worse. and I'm sure that was an advantage to my then other half  !
<br />I was a fool to believe the best in someone I put my trust in .
<br />But the heart is fickle, and cant we all be idiots even if it is the wrong decisions for the right reasons 
<br /> Life is so much better now I certainly don’t live in fear and that is so much of a blessing hard to understand I guess unless you have to walk in those shoes .
<br />Thank god I don’t now.
<br />One of my kids once said I could run my hubby round me finger .. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> why would I want to ?
<br />a mutual respect thing gets and gives you far more pleasure and you certainly cant replace real trust.
<br /><br />I watch my friend as she walked back to collect her car . it would be selfish to believe I am in anyway responsible for HER life changes .
<br /> I only told her a fraction of the ways it had effected my kids (how was it effecting her family<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />How things had upset us all , and the easy way out wasnt for us the right one . How disrupted and changed their lives were now  forever  and how by putting up with &quot;stuff&quot; things had got far worse at the time.
<br /> I do hope I see her in September when she comes back to see  family over here .
<br />Anyway the suns now out and I really dont want to waste another day lifes far to short   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Have a great day world and keep up the  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /> (best laid plans and all that)  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Started off cramps through the night ...... headache  etc.  
<br /><br />Trouble is I 'm probebly just missing my kids I guess, 
<br />Getting more worried with every day that passes but, their .old enough to cope  ... right ...?
<br />Hard to know what the right thing to do is....but in a bit o pain 
<br />So...
<br />Took my medication I was going went to bed.
<br />Next min its way past when I needed to be up and
<br /> No way was I running for No train   Id hurt.
<br /> So let family know I couldn’t get 
<br />Better than getting there in a mess.
<br /> Bit to stressed now anyway.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> I don’t like driving to far 
<br />(any real travelling makes me uneasy what ever the mode of motion) and usually have to have sing along music, and try and remember a bag of accessories just in case I heave. 
<br />Truth is sometimes its fine, others ...yuck.
<br />Well pottered around house garden,( No real shakes there then) No heavy lifting, I was good.
<br />Gets to about 10ish and I wandered over to the local wasteland with me trolley to hunt for a piece of tree.
<br /> Well we saw this thick shaved tree branch in pet shop basically a slice of tree hollowed out with seeds in. Stupid money (well trendy pet accessory) 
<br />Stupid amount of money (I’m sure I can make that)   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Managed to find a couple of bits of reasonably small bits threw them in me trolley  (weird feeling)
<br />and headed off back .
<br />( that’s a couple of chunks less for the environment to clutter) 
<br />Then came home to &quot; potter again) did some &quot;light&quot;house work stuff ironing. 
<br />Oh and hubby telephone to make sure I was going to collect him and DID I want a massive log!!!!!!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Nah.....!
<br /> I couldn’t tell him I was feeling like crap, migraine for England the full works. 
<br />Better pack some baby wipes and stuff in bag might just need spare clothing if this carries on. In case I cough to much (blush) <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Usually get the pleasure of feeling rough when I been in the sun to much
<br />And yep been in the sun to much. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> My own fault.
<br />Still struggling with the tummy cramps not serious but combined with the Mother of migraines   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />( not good.)
<br />Started driving and had to pull over  ( felt dizzy nausea and queezy)
<br />tipped me bag out on the verge and had a fumble felt better didn’t need it after all 
<br />Threw it all back in and thought I'd top up the wiper pot.
<br />Seemed to work taking my mind off the nausea for a little bit.... and I found an old bottle of water in a old volvic bottle or some such brand and sipped that  thing.   Then I was heaving again 
<br />quick tip of the bag on the verge again and I grabbed the baby wipes    Nah there useless 
<br /> I found, me pair of spare undies. Blimey that'll do  
<br />Yep was sick. Again and caught me t shirt. decided at least now I didn’t feel dizzy 
<br />And someone else was pulling up in the lay-by probably car sick too 
<br />Am conscious woman on her own well you know the rest ........
<br />Not that covered in <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sick.gif" alt=":)" /> is an attractive feature in a lady   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> but I'm sure theres websites EVEN for things like THAT on here  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> seems to cater for alsorts this web
<br /><br />Had better start up again for collection of hubby.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> windows down and fresh air might work.
<br />Pulled up again in another lay-by........  Just burping stale water now......!
<br /><br />I pulled up in some store before I collected his worship. 
<br />He telephoned and DEFINETLY no way I will be playing with that when I'm driving.
<br />Guess years driving with relentless kids in the car was good moral training,
<br /> I’m still extra careful and wont risk a stupid accident its not worth it…
<br /> So off up and pit stop.
<br /><br />Quickly grabbed some rubbish from in of the car ( lets face it it soon mounts when your at the garden centres shopping guests with their crap yep soon mounts ) to put in the bin on my way to the shop.
<br />Well might as well tidy up at same time.; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Then                             The public loo 
<br />Ended up for a quick wash and freshen up top now washed and in a bag with just me jacket on where me t shirt had been.
<br />Apparently I looked like crap. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />( according to hubby) awe bless! 
<br />Well hardly surprising.
<br /> I GOT A DAM MIGRAINE
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br />He had made me a cuppa t in the works room when I got there but I couldn’t drink it..
<br />Then home to a lovely hot bath and then bed.
<br />Not a very exciting day but I know I shouldn’t go out in the bright sun without protection so its my own stupid fault.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />At least I got a cuddle  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />before his nibs went off to do his thing , and I to do mine.
<br />And today??? Well That’s a whole NEW ray of sunshine.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />all the best world  I'm  gonna have to rest  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Well cramps are slowly going , get good and bad days,the breathing pains are still quite bad ,
<br />Havent been heaving for nearly a week so....... but slowly getting back to some sort of normallity .
<br /> I did manage to go see family which was lovely . Got woken up by playful pets who dont understand the meaning of the word fear. so basically I didnt stand a chance  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />If hadnt been so dam cute maybe I could have been more assertive but lets face it at 3 in the morning the last thing you feel like doing is getting out of bed and throwing a tizzy I truly believed things would die down but nope..! what I wouldnt have given to have just been able to have an instant pet bowl full of  chow  down Tylenol PM lmao .
<br />But well ya cant have everyting  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I managed to get some stuff done while I was there that I have intended to do for such a long time .
<br /><br />Unfortunately I did have one real nasty shock
<br /> a  member of my family has died 
<br />,and unfortunately the ibs has flared up again 
<br />nasty bain from hell.....! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sick.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I was given a couple of things as a memory and told I could go for a chat as they were sprinkled right next to their other half.I went for a chat and of course had a good old weep.
<br />he 1st person in my family I can every remember showing me love, They put me through college, helped me get jobs, helped me get promoted , recued us when my kids were in danger. I will miss them beyond words and absolutely no material things could help I actually think its a bit spooky but.... maybe one day I will apreciate the fact I have somthing that was special to them. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />on a brighter note  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I have on the other hand been able to do a little gardening nothing to stretching, just a potter but it all helps .
<br /> I am happy with the little bit I have done although it did take all day.
<br /> I did some repairs and they seem to be a good idea./ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />time will tell.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Pet s were bit annoying at the moment guess my patience is a bit thin I gave the parrot some toast thats normally a good shuter upper but I guess its his way of saying &quot;hello mam&quot; come play with me now your back at 5 in the morning  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> come play COME PLAY  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Unfortunately the other fellas think its a good idea to join in. with hubby still in bed grr <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We saw a frog in the pond yesterday late and I was really supprised . its lovely to sit outside as it goes dusk or daylight wih a chair and acuppa you see so very much and I find it very relaxing.Highly recomended.
<br /><br />Having travelled several hundred miles over the past few days its been so nice to settle the sunburn and just chill lets  see what today brings . something nice I hope  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />What a lovely day 
<br />I think I'll paint the bookcase
<br /> outside
<br /> in the garden
<br /> in the sunshine 
<br />it will dry quicker...!
<br /><br />WHAT WAS I THINKING  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Every thing with wings decided to weld itself to the paint.
<br />You cant get them off 
<br />and time so you have this er...... 
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" /> lumpy  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" /> blobby  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> consistancy to the wood 
<br />you definetly ........ didnt plan for.
<br /><br />Kinda cool I guess , 
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> millions of years in the future this crappy cheapo bookcase 
<br />will be an relic of the past and probebly worth,,,,,, 
<br />millions of ...
<br /><br />giggles  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Not so much fun for the bugs though. 
<br /><br /><strong></strong><em><span style="text-decoration:underline">on a brighter note...! </span></em>
<br /><br />Took my father in law to his &quot;special&quot; adult clinic 
<br />what a treat.
<br />This blokes spent most of his life being a wonderful father and dedicated provider for his family 
<br /> Apart from reading the odd book or watching the tv the poor blokes had no real excitement in his life.
<br /><br />Well apart from the kids ,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> and if you met my husband  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/southpark.gif" alt=":)" /> when hes in
<br /><br />half a pinta beer and in STALLION mode er....   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/elvis.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />you'd know exactly what I mean.
<br /><br />He can be a bit ...er.. naughty 
<br /><br />Anyway all of a sudden Hubbys dad is making the most wonderful things.
<br />He left out the old charabang and couldnt wait to get to do his day out thing 
<br /><br />he became  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mrt.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Was so funny 
<br />What a pity he didnt have the bottle to start somthing like this years ago its giving him loads of pleasure 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" /> and hes actually doing somthing hes both enjoying and learning with,
<br /><br />Everyone seems to be booking his new found craft items already for Chrimbo.
<br /><br />But the pride on his face 
<br />alone is worth millions 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />His whole world must have felt like it was falling apart when he was diagnosed.
<br /><br />I know he  cant possibly realise just how ill he is
<br /><br />but I'm positive he knows its going to get even harder 
<br />and thats not an easy thing for anyone to have to live with .
<br />I will take him next time and see what hes making 
<br />Hopfully open the motors door for him before he leaps out again 
<br />the mans on a dam mission  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> I swear. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />If anyone out there is reading this and considering a new hobby in one of this council run adult centres ....
<br /><br />go for it whats the worst that can happen 
<br /><br />you dont go back 
<br /><br />Best thing this guys done in years and its really changed his world for the better.
<br /><br />What a lovely thing to see.
<br />Anyway enough dribbling for now 
<br />Back to me bug ridden  bookcase  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Have a great day world and keep smiling  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /> Am finding more and more my days are starting in the early hours
<br /> and finishing after midnight, 
<br />really getting bizzarre  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I did finish the bookcase
<br /> it looks rather  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> good
<br /> if I dont say so my self.
<br />It wouldnt fit where I wanted to put it 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />so major move round <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> in the furniture department 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> it'll grow on me .
<br />Had to move a cabinet
<br /> ONLY
<br /> to find out 
<br />Mr Parrot, has been 
<br />eating  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />and clawing our woodwork 
<br /><br />Not his fault
<br /> I blame the old man  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />He was the door opener  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hes almost as much a handfull as my kids were,
<br />Peels off the wallpaper,
<br /> and throws his food almost as far in temper  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />and WE wont EVEN discuss his bedtime routine..!!! 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I guess 
<br />Pets are like children
<br /><br />they respond to love, understanding, and  food 
<br />and lets face it GIFTS  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />,
<br />Though I think a bit o &quot;bling&quot; wouldnt go a miss 
<br />in the toy department  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />growling  would be pointless , 
<br />I did think about chewing up HIS home
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> but metal bars are just NOT in my diet  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I will soon have a birthday 
<br />and like every year I will be thinking about 
<br />the birthdays within my imediate family
<br /><br />How much I miss them , 
<br />and how much I wish ......
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But being realistic I CANT afford to splash out as other do.
<br />I'm NOT flash,
<br /> and certainly DONT do things to be SEEN to be a good Mum
<br />as Mums we just are...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I guess THATS why they tell me stuff 
<br />They wouldnt dream of telling  my ex  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And I CERTAINLY wouldnt tell HIM
<br />I figure it takes alot to tell me in the 1st place.
<br />when their down and the mistakes seem so big
<br />I cant agree with alot of todays standards but ...
<br />its MY kids so just hold them up 
<br /><br />My husband has been brilliant 
<br />Wish I'd met him 1st 
<br />Hes so different really dependable, and 
<br />gentle . 
<br />Though  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mrt.gif" alt=":)" /> he has his moments  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyway gotta go  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />bye world   have a great day <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Cant we just be pleased with who were are , what we have...?
<br />I was once accused of being full of my self 
<br />What a load of crap ..! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />It took me a very long time to learn 
<br />We should be proud of who we are and NOT ashamed!!!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I was watching a &quot;sale&quot; of jewelry on one of the shopping channels the other night and boy ok
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />I <strong>was</strong> tempted 
<br />some real <em>&quot;bling&quot;</em> there  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I even mentioned it when he tel 
<br />I love the sound of hubbys giggle of fear  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />but to be fair I'm sure he knew I wasnt serious 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />and anyway  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hubby will shortly be spending a disgusting amount of dosh
<br />well for us  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> anyway  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> on a special family celebration 
<br />(Of which I cant wait by the way )
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Hes been hinting at a particular &quot;somthing&quot; for months now
<br />Hes been checking out humbuckers and resonators , I know hes been saving to try and make me even happier
<br />I feel lucky and blessed as a woman and a person .
<br />Dont think I <strong>need </strong>ANYTHING , I'm NOT beaten or unduly neglected.
<br />Hubby works hard.And he is honest and dependable
<br />What HE says is WHAT U get !
<br />I get regular hugs and am treated like a princess (if I'm honest)
<br />In short in my whole life  NEVER had it so good 
<br />There are times in truth like most people I could &quot;weep&quot; for England
<br /><br />We all have our regrets ,demons, of past battles 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Some people who I find disgustingly dishonest 
<br />and who think NOTHING of playing one person off against another .
<br />And you know what ...
<br />They may NEVER know what it really feels like to feel real security or love.
<br />Or just be happy when YOU dont need to look it  for others  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And I'd be a liar if I didnt say I feel sorry for them
<br /> With all they have they STILL have nothing .
<br /><br />I mean a fully dependable nothing to much to ask 
<br />(though DONT exspect to get it  dependability  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />)
<br />and unquestionable  no cross examination trust...........
<br /><br />We dont have loadsa dosh, posh this, exspensive that ...
<br />our last wedding aniversary was a walk through a beautiful sunset 
<br />by the side of a picturesque river.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We were to skint to splash out  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And I wouldnt trade this life 
<br />Things could be better ,
<br />But then things have been alot worse.
<br />In short 
<br />I am a grateful woman 
<br />My Only real regret.
<br />There are times I would love to be able to share 
<br />these wonderful exsperiances with my family .
<br />Ah well  
<br />If all else fails 
<br />HOT bath, Hot mug of cocao ,HOT cuddle by the t.v.  and c.h.o.c.l.a.t.e.
<br /><br />Night all keep up the smiles  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />What to say 
<br />The weather was nice  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/southpark.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We took pack up  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We looked on the TV, met check, and checked papers and 
<br />&quot;it would rain&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Great investigating 
<br />Nah  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Weather was lovely.
<br />So me fluffy boots were  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />bit daft really  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Up early, done me make-up, prepared a picnic,
<br /> got on a long train journey ,
<br />Ok I fell on some bloke as I was walking back to my seat
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Train swerved (HONEST) 
<br /><br />Who then told his mates <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />&quot;Happy birthday&quot; to me 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hubby was laughing but I well  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />(Dam him) 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We got there in good time and sat down near the front set out our bags, 
<br />I was amazing just how MANY people were piling in and sitting down behind us 
<br />as we were adjusting ourselves  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Got the marks and sparks picnic blanket out 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Jackets off, camera gear at the ready,
<br />And Yep we were sitting ready in Hyde Park to begin
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Then the music starts; the crowd claps, and the comments over the loudspeakers begin 
<br />And....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I kid you <strong> NOT </strong>
<br /><br /><strong>Some </strong>
<br />People at the front stood up
<br /><br />Completely blocking the thousands of peoples view!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The shouts from the back of 
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline">    <em>  <strong>&quot;SIT DOWN &quot;</strong> [i] </em> [u] </span>
<br /><br />Could clearly be heard 
<br /><br />They looked around but like cows in a field chewing the cud they &quot;didn’t &quot; realise 
<br />All those people
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/scanner.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><em> <strong> Actually meant them </strong> </em>
<br /><br />After about 5 min’s of chanting and clapping
<br />This healthy loud, 
<br />Specimen 
<br />Of hormonally overdosed  male 
<br />Came screaming through to the crowd
<br /><br />Waving his arms stamping his feet, 
<br />And calling the selfish human down-grades various 
<br />&quot;Naughty&quot; but accurate grownup unpleasantness’ 
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />(History in the making)
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I pressed record on the camcorder 
<br />Dam I missed the 1st bit 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Things were picking up 
<br />Would we actually see something? 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Well a few brain cells kicked in a several people sat down 
<br />Wonderful!!!
<br />But Hey here comes another announcement and....
<br />Yep even more of the mentally challenged stood up!
<br />We shouted and clapped again,
<br />Mr <strong>&quot;stampalot&quot;</strong>
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> by this point was redeveloping the English language 
<br />Very colourful.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Now I admit there were thousands of people there but were also adding kids!
<br />You got kids,
<br />Bored ones, in heat and rattle like that.
<br />Must be terrifying for em 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />You <strong> then </strong> get the section of crowd that moves their kids away from the venue
<br />How sad.
<br />Its NOT ON!
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Like Rabbits caught in the headlights the cavalcade of intelligence raped morons weren’t budging 
<br />What a dam shame for all the rest of us 
<br />The marshal’s were walking around but didn’t seem to do a dam thing just &quot;giggle&quot;.
<br />Hardly well organised..
<br />We were beginning to wonder if 
<br />Red Bull Flugtag were ….
<br />More interested in marketing perhaps?
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Well it was going out live on the radio and by the time it gets to the record.
<br />It probably sounded like a blur in the breeze.
<br /><br />The ignorant mentally impaired cretinous morons were spoiling the experience for all the rest of us.
<br /><br />Now Ok the tickets to the red bull flugtag are free 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />if your lucky enough to get them 
<br /><br />But come on 
<br />You wouldn’t be grateful 
<br />For a free lobotomy
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Would you,
<br />Well if it was on &quot;big brother &quot;
<br />And televised live
<br />Maybe....   Some ... people....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Anyways we didn’t want to stay for the ongoing unpleasantness 
<br /> I rang one of my sons as promised
<br />He was hearing all the kafuffle we could.
<br />  And He wasn’t impressed either.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We couldn’t have been the only ones to have gone
<br /> To the expense and trouble to be there in plenty of time 
<br />For what was advertised as a &quot;wonderful day out &quot; 
<br />And it would have been if...
<br />SO
<br />We moved.
<br />Right to the other end of the viewers stands.
<br />We could at least see water now.
<br />Hubby gets out his camera and were off again.
<br />Yep I saw a flash of red!!!!
<br />Blimey 
<br />By this time its about 5pm and the flashes got more frequent 
<br />We were getting to see even more 
<br />Brilliant.
<br />We heard in honesty a lot more than we saw 
<br />Fun was stopped for a while as a swan had landed in the serpentine and 
<br />Yep health and safety wouldn’t allow a continuation until the swan had been removed 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />fair enough.
<br /><br />It dragged on for a bit , a display of kites 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Well music was fairly decent
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We hardly get chance to go out as a couple so 
<br />Were going to 
<br />Stick this thing out!!!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Then....
<br />Here we go again.
<br />Along come a couple two kids and a buggy 
<br />And storm trampled over blankets and legs.
<br />Now I understand why some people disrespect and stereotype.
<br />They were unkempt covered in bling and tattoos, smoking and spitting 
<br />Basically thought they owned the place cos they were IN!!!
<br />Group of dark skinned late teens early 20s 
<br />People politely asked if they would please &quot;sit down&quot;.
<br />I heard them, I saw them.
<br />What I saw next made me ashamed to be a British, white person.
<br />They itched in front of the group on the blanket and stood in front of them 
<br />Completely blocking any views.
<br />So hey guess what...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />EVERYONE began to 
<br /><strong>STAND UP </strong>
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Its crazy. 
<br /> I tapped one of the girls on the shoulder 
<br />Because people were THEN shouting at THEM!!!!
<br />And explained Id seen it all asked them if they could sit down, 
<br />Announced NOT every white person in Britain was deeming themselves the 
<br />&quot;Supreme race&quot;
<br />And asked if there was anyway they could see as everyone shouting was getting angry
<br />By this point &quot;yeti dad&quot;
<br /> Had scooped one of the kids about 10?
<br /> Onto his shoulders directly in front of us!!!!
<br />The shouts got louder.
<br />I tried to loudly explain at this point the anger was directed
<br />Because THEY hadn’t realised the &quot;plebs&quot; in front 
<br />Were instigating the problem
<br />I may  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> I'm ashamed to say have said a few other things 
<br />The repulsive couple scooped up their offspring and made a getaway 
<br />WONDERFUL
<br />Here comes Doctor who and his tardis about 5 from the finish!
<br />We saw the last contestants and It had to be enough!
<br />Back for a jaunt through London
<br />Get through the heat of the underground
<br />Bought couple of cans for the train journey home 
<br />and huggle on the train
<br />And Omg!
<br />Here comes the I.B.S.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Got home and I then had to curl up on the couch 
<br />It was all too much.
<br />No Passion tonight then 
<br />(poor baby)
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />If I was to raise the issues direct with the organisers of the 
<br />Red Bull Flugtag 
<br /> I would hope they knew that it sounded quite good fun
<br />The bits we <strong> were </strong> <strong> able </strong>  <em> <strong>to see</strong> </em> 
<br />Where a credit
<br />However
<br />The upset caused through badly organised enforcement 
<br /><strong>WAS </strong>
<br /> Why possibly your crowds were getting smaller
<br />WE couldn’t EVEN see the screen 
<br />HOW HIGH UP?
<br />That’s WHY people went for a wander in the rest of the park 
<br />What a shame.
<br /><br />We have memories of people that are wonderful.
<br />And some which were quite unnerving and scary 
<br />My husband became  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mrt.gif" alt=":)" /> and <strong> THAT’S [b]</strong> unacceptable 
<br />Not a good advert.
<br />And quite frankly 
<br />I hope other people vote with their wallets in future to .
<br />It was an experience 
<br />alot of people like ourselves will have mixed feelings over 
<br />Thankyou but
<br />NO thanks 
<br />all the best

<br />As also had some of my literature published recently 
<br />(Not bad for a girl with hardly ANY education)
<br />I would have felt much &quot;less&quot;
<br />of a human being had I NOT done somthing, so I sat down and ....
<br />Took me best part of all day actually I was so careful.
<br />Showed &quot;hubby&quot; after  and  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Ok hes a brilliant support ,
<br /> I'm sure he thought I was pulling his leg when I said I was 
<br />thinking of submitting some stuff I 've been entangled with for quite some time 
<br />(NOT by choice I may add ) 
<br />But hey You tend to find out lots of things you NEVER wanted to know 
<br />especially about people you thought you could trust 
<br />so hey 
<br />lifes a learning curve.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> and OH boy has things been &quot;curvey &quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We have a funny old thing going on in this month
<br /><br />I have two of my kids have birthdays  close together 
<br />Actually same day as mine and  on the day after.
<br />As  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> MY birthday  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Makes for  a suprise birthday pressy (twice)
<br />Best EVER  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />So of course like most loving mothers I spend months in advance
<br />scanning the shops, net, and catalogues for just the right 
<br />packages
<br />I cant possibly
<br />afford
<br />to lighten up the loves of my life 
<br />already exstensive collection of 
<br />&quot;tatt&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I can ONLY pray they like the reversable  socks 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Just kidding  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Went to visit family as requested and because we arent able to have time 
<br />(Which hurts beyond words )
<br />with one of our family
<br />I bought a recordable birthday card
<br />(HOW MUCH!)  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And prayed a suitable message could be left by everyone present 
<br /><br />Without to many swear words and referances to various 
<br />modern day &quot;hobbies&quot; shall we say.
<br /><br />(Lord these people are HOW old    <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />(take nine hundred and fifty three )
<br />&quot;cut&quot; thats a rap! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Just hope it brings on a warm smile 
<br />grrrrrrr  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />only hope the battery lasts long enough to play the flamin message  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Well I  finally recovering from cloud nine and  the last &quot;birthday&quot;.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />One of my sons bought me one of those mp3 player things 
<br />Massive memory on the thing and he'd loaded it up with loads of  music.
<br />I was overcome with the effort he put in to my pressy 
<br />Getting &quot;funky&quot; with everything from the &quot;ping pong&quot; song
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" /> to Fall out boys 
<br />&quot;Thanks for the memories&quot; 
<br />I   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> them 
<br />There was some eighty stuff on there that flooded memories back
<br />moving to  an Amerie song I'd Not heard before then to &quot;Go west&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/innocent.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />EVEN had 
<br /> &quot;happy birthday&quot; by Altered images 
<br />Amazing how certain songs can instantly bring back flavours, feelings,
<br />or warm  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> of moments long gone.
<br />Now if only He'd have had 
<br />&quot;I have the power&quot; By snap
<br />Hed have had the song I started in labour with him 
<br />Thank you...... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> NO ! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Was lisening to it for several hours while I traveled home.
<br /> Hubby of course kept up the text and tel calls while working his usual lengthy shift.
<br />guiding my journey home to make sure I'm ok and things are good 
<br />Imagine his suprise  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> when I exsplained 
<br />couple of gay blokes  sat other side of table 
<br />had been &quot;boppin&quot; to some of the oldies 
<br />Blimey that was funny 
<br />old dear behind us actually said HER hips had NEVER worked THAT way 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Nah seriously 
<br />The blokes in the shop were &quot;really &quot; helpful
<br />Some old bloke was playing a harmonica
<br /> I guess it must have looked a bit funny some housewife 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fancy.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Still find it amazing having the REALLY &quot;nice&quot; things happen to ME! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We have been through Denmark street in London 
<br />How many times
<br /> I knew what I wanted 
<br />So ok my fingers can hardly type cos I'm so sore and tender!
<br />but hey 
<br />its beautiful.
<br />Oh and when I put the pedal on to &quot;flange&quot; setting 
<br /><br />WOAHHHHHHHH! Lets get &quot;funky&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Been married nearly 5 year and this is the very 1st thing 
<br />I actually asked for 
<br />FOR ME!!!
<br />and ooh boy ....
<br /> I doubt if I'll be asking for ANYthing EVER again .
<br />Well better NOT push it 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We did manage to get some stuff done in the garden which 
<br />quite frankly 
<br />is a miracle 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />His royal  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/elvis.gif" alt=":)" /> is all stiff as a board 
<br />(lucky ME)  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Later today I have the docs, and AGAIN tomorrow 
<br /> and lets just say its NOT my best side  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />that usually helps my day I love going , get to do loads of stuff met some lovely people there ,
<br /> and its always nice to get out the house I guess.
<br />I tel one of my kids ( well hardly a child in some ways) were talking fairly late teens but somtimes  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I wonder.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I rarely hear from them unless THEY want something.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> isnt THAT always the way  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Now its NOT because their dad told me this person  stole laptops from School
<br /> Or the fact HE also told me this member of family was a liar or stole from HIS house.
<br />But its the fact this person isnt being honest with me.
<br /><br />Doubt he has been for some time ,
<br /> But he dosent seem to realise how stupid he sounds somtimes .
<br />Such a shame!
<br />I promised myself I'd try and help if I could but I got this text to tel ,
<br /> Knew he wanted SOMTHING!!!! but.....
<br />How silly , how can HE not realise  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />    I know when I 'm being baited.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> and I said so  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br /> I'm sad for the family that is so easily led.but saying that
<br /> I put my trust in somone for years an EVEN when I lost the few friends , 
<br />and EVEN the respect of my own Mum for putting up with the lies 
<br />I refused to believe what a complete loser and liar
<br /> the same person family has put their  trust in really is ! 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But unfortunately THEY will learn , hopfully NOT at such a cost as I did. 
<br /> I on the other hand am NOT prepared to be drawn in...
<br /> I will sit back and try NOT to become to involved 
<br />My own life is such I really dont need the rubbish they are playing in .
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" /> I'm outa that ..................thank god!!!!!!!
<br /><br />On a brighter note 
<br />My birthday pressy is definetly apreciated I still have soft tender fingers but
<br /> am slowly relearning scales, rifs, and boogie woogie.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />although at this stage I guess I'm so much more like 
<br />&quot;fingers stumbly wumbly&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />Blimey <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> they hurt  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Even the dam parrots a <strong>&quot;CRITIC&quot;</strong>
<br />The books I invested in are hard going for now as I have to stop to turn  pages 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> and bet your bottom dollar the next bit is completely impossible  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Nah seriously  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" /> I have EVERY intention of mastering this again.
<br /><br />Had a long chat on tel with my Merrican mate 
<br />shes got family with other family stuff going off ,
<br />loads to chat about we were on till nearly half nine 
<br />was a real old nater  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hubby will a real stinger of a tel bill this month
<br /> I've been ringing the kids mobiles   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> er  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> bit too much I guess.
<br />The reality is I better cut down,
<br /> its not really like THEY cant ring me ,
<br /> and THEY usually do when THEY want somthing , 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />Hubby 's usually right when it comes to my kids 
<br />and it dont matter how much I hate it when he is ,
<br /><br />hes STILL right  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />There were  times I used to be so proud of my kids ,
<br /> but I cant say that to often now 
<br />and tell the truth when I say it .
<br />And thats such a real  a shame , 
<br />because I have to sit in these flamin meetings when my ex is pressent
<br /> and lisern to him ranting on about what &quot;losers&quot; &quot;druggies&quot; and &quot;wasters&quot; 
<br />That various members are supposed to be. 
<br />That just breaks my heart .
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Ahh well later today 
<br />I will be yet another blurrrrrrrrrrr
<br /> as we have such alot to be doing over the next few days .
<br /> I cant wait . Busy Busy Busy to prepare ready ( will be brilliant). <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fancy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Hubby takes really good care of me

<br /> I cant wait I'm so excited.
<br />Just be lovely if I could have enjoyed the exsperiance with my kids but ........

<br />Today I write a blog of personal embarrassment.
<br /> Hubby took me out to a beer festival, ( I rarely indulge as they say)
<br />Having tried several glasses of the hooch provided I think I can safely say.
<br />I may not be the last person standing when the bar was to close.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Definitely NOT a heavy drinker and strictly half pints.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Being very aware I don’t want to end up with the docs at the local hospital 
<br />Showing off their &quot;rubber glove&quot; techniques again <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Nah I was good 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> well  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> fairly
<br />Was a beautiful place though a genuine Suffolk barn complete with the local country &quot;yokels &quot;
<br /> real characters but a real good giggle I guess  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I was chatting to one of my kids on the mobby as we got off the train
<br /> when Hubby muttered something.
<br />He swears he saw Roy Hudd getting in the taxi that had stopped in front of us ,
<br /> as I was busy explaining the complexities of washing a feather duvet in the automatic washer
<br />to  one of my sons.
<br /> I do hope he doesn’t try it as its bound to be a disaster if he does
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> I swear he puts everything into boil wash.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />Lovely
<br />Suprised he hasnt got tipsy and put a sack o spuds in  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He likes to try new exsperiances 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I was just so happy to be able to finally spend time with my old man .
<br />I dont think he realises somtimes just how much I have given up to be with him
<br />How much I miss my family , and how things are  when hes always rushing round with 
<br />other family crisis , of which there always seems to be so many!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Took my father inlaw to his craft day and managed to get his birthday pressy 
<br />Had ordered him an overall with the place name of the craft workshop he attends.
<br />Really overpriced but he looked like hed won the lottery 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> I know its not his firthday yet but what the hell ... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Lets see what tommorrow brings a better day  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />lets see 
<br /><br />nite all  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" /> have a good one  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Surprise we got up and yep trip to the big city to see of all things 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Doctor who
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Funny how all things circle back 
<br />I was NEVER allowed to watch much TV as a kid, 
<br />Well afraid we weren’t the most affluent family in the street.
<br />Single family, out of work you know the type...
<br />Always had to thump!! The old valves on the Black and white tv just to get crossroads 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> so watching a decent programme usually meant me old Mum 
<br />Lost hers and THAT wasn’t EVER going to happen.
<br /> I grew up worked like an idiot in various jobs 
<br />Most of which I absolutely loved then...
<br /> I got the kids and well just seemed to have NO free time so would watch any old thing.
<br />One day was flicking through the free view and spied of all things Doc who
<br />Well worth 5 min’s think I 
<br />Hubby came down from bed (shift worker syndrome)
<br />And plonks himself in front of our TV and commented on it being crap
<br />And the ONLY Doc worth his salt was 
<br />The one with the long scarf...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fancy.gif" alt=":)" />  Tom Baker  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/elvis.gif" alt=":)" /> Nah  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> it isn’t!!!!!!!
<br />(How the hell would I know  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So we had the heated debate
<br />Over the 1st of the days debates while watching the 
<br />David Tennant guy and THAT did it 
<br />Hubbys &quot;hooked&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Well we get to Earls Court (3rd time we’ve been there THIS year to see something )
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> and go see the Doctor Who exhibition
<br />Outstanding I took the camcorder and did my poor David Bailey impression
<br />While hubby took his ickle kit of picture capture electronics and off we went
<br />Weren’t to bad actually
<br />Wish I could have taken the kids though especially when they were younger 
<br />They would have absolutely loved it
<br />But realistically was amazing I could actually get my ex to be present Christmas day
<br /> and EVEN then he didnt want to be there , and had absolututely 
<br />NO idea what Id got the kids, how hard I'd saved or what I'd written on the labels to make it seem
<br /> like HE could give a stuff .
<br />Which looking back, if his parents hadn’t come down for the day I doubt if he’d have bothered to sit in front of the family while the kids got excited and excitedly ripped  open the packages
<br />He NEVER had an idea about what I’d scrapped and saved for, bought or wrapped up ... 
<br />Sad or what...
<br />But I cherish the home videos its a special time that you can NEVER get back .......
<br /><br />But I degress thank the lord those horrible days are gone...
<br /> back to the blogg thingy  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We saw numerous excited people dressed up as Doctor who etc, 
<br />Whole families  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Quite funny actually 
<br />You EVER seen a grandma with side burns  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":)" /> dam scary  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> .
<br />Hubby bit disappointed though he got all the round muttering in little moments 
<br />&quot; Wonder what Davros will be doing&quot;
<br />Various characters were animated 
<br />There was a massive queen spider from the film that physically extends 
<br />And various animated Cybermen, and the Darlek show at the end isn’t bad.
<br />NO Davros though 
<br />SHAME that!
<br /><br />I videoed it and it aint THAT bad at all 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> ok it aint award winning photography  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />either  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Not to many fingers in the shots <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />After the &quot;lunch treat&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> we wandered up to 
<br />Tottenham court road via the tube and bought a few bits
<br />Proceeded to &quot;Denmark st&quot; where Hubby goes halves on a ridiculously priced part 
<br />To attach to my &quot;birthday pressy&quot; 
<br />I didn’t say anything but he must have noticed me looking while I was there
<br />Past few years been able to take up previous hobbies
<br /> Which had to take a back seat because of the growing family
<br />Well family always did come first, always will.
<br />But its lovely to be able to do other things too,
<br />Amazing how if your not careful you soon loose your personality, even your identity 
<br />When you have others so dependant on you cant let other people you care about down.
<br />But that’s the past.
<br />When we got home was a little tipsy and lethargic so had a nap 
<br />Hubby snook out and when he got back after midnight, I had a surprise for him
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Managed to get some camcorder stuff on pc 
<br />Thanks to the cable I bought as a surprise in London.
<br />Yippee over 70 megabytes of our day 
<br />Boy oh boy was it interesting <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />A true test of love if EVER there was one  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The poor man politely sat through over 30 min’s of home made video  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Ah true tact...
<br />Everyday I wake up and count my blessings life can be really good 
<br />Even if it’s bad. But it takes real inner strength and personal hardship I guess to developed character and solid fortitude.
<br />Maybe one day I will master the latter ...but for now ... back to this dam video camera  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Night world and have a good one  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Yesterday has got to be marked on one of the better days I have had since I got married.
<br />Some (coff) few years ago.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We had to go into see about replacing the old telly and yep we are getting THAT sorted  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Ooh yer... finally can watch telly while snuggling upstairs.
<br />Ok we are going to be a bit tight for cash 
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" /> but...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Yippee <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We bought bag o pea nuts and walked around a local area of natural beauty.
<br />Lake was shimmering and the rain at one point bounced off while the mandarin ducks played 
<br />in the swirls of water.
<br />We could see fish just making shapes on the top of the silvery water 
<br />And the eerie quiet of the day was just magical.
<br />Hubby got some pics of one likely young squirrel that performed for us for his peanuts.
<br />They are really comical creatures as they hang upside down on the bark of the tree
<br />Trying to get the nuts as they fall out the shells to the floor 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />It was so funny; you could almost see the young face of the squirrel 
<br />Form the swear expressions but he didn’t give up. 
<br />We went and had lunch out 
<br />(Something we haven’t done in well I can remember)
<br />Proper sit and eat job with the old romantic music and serve at the table job.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> .
<br />Then back through the shops and home for cuppa and get rid of shopping.
<br />Out later for another camera session and
<br /> Hey this place was EVEN more surreal.
<br />A heron basking in the rain and sunshine 
<br />As he stood proudly attentively looking for a late lunch.
<br /><br />Fish leaping and performing the somersaults of summer 
<br /><br />The silver shapes flashing so briefly as the gentle re-entry into the lake  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> You could almost get out the score cards  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Opps my mobile went.
<br /><br />We had been so quiet  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Tel call from couple of my now grown up kids
<br />Obviously giggly and &quot;not&quot; quite themselves <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I keep getting &quot;roped&quot; into family conflicts and THEN get accused of the most ridiculous of situations 
<br />So trying to be sensible and firm with two mature child like men is always a challenge.
<br />Don’t matter how much you love your kids to bits
<br />You STILL want to point out &quot;alternative&quot; behaviour that WOULD be more advantageous.
<br />So in my own way I try to steer the conversation to &quot;other matters&quot; 
<br />In the vain hope the conversation will go well 
<br />And I just can’t be bothered to be  involved in yet MORE  promises made by others
<br />That NEVER get kept.
<br />For e.g.
<br />A family meeting that will happen in a couple of months once someone is able to &quot;settle in&quot;
<br />Yep its over two and a half years and ... well you get the idea.
<br />I cant stand liars 
<br />never could
<br /><br />I didn’t want to get yet again  into the loop of fake promises 
<br /><br />And 
<br /><br />Keep the love and respect of family without the interference of concern that Mums can’t help? 
<br />Now you see.
<br /><br />We got home and snugggled up on the couch in front of a romantic comedy film 
<br />Hubby  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" /> was lovely just like when we were 1st married.
<br />.
<br />This last few years I think the pressure amd problems of both our families 
<br />pulling and demanding has really been unacceptable 
<br />Both sides his and mine, demanding with VERY  little give.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />My foot firmly down maybe the penny is finally dropping 
<br /><br />We are all just people and with only so much of ourselves to give
<br />We need to make time for us too
<br />Just time to be ourselves 
<br />A little selfish few hours a week , 
<br />So we feel and remember why we got married in the 1st place.
<br />And it HAS been worth it  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Blood pressure down  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />When you start to feel like passing ships in the night ,,,,,,,,,
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />just running round after others and not finding time to do things needed for yourselves ....
<br />Well ...
<br /><br />Now were more like &quot;Bumper cars&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Much better  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> Have a good one  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="609fbcd2eea7c5bea0321f78874e0f4" url=""><![CDATA[illness<br/><br/>Today I recieved an email .
<br /><br />It was abusive, and nasty, 
<br />it was insulting and agressive.
<br />It blamed me personally for everything that has happened to this family members life 
<br />I hope they read this.
<br />Ok I was shocked and upset.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But more so by the idiot rantings. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I should be angry but I am sad.
<br />How easy it is to blame others for our own failings ,
<br />Our past, Things that happen that change our lives.
<br />We are the ones that can change our destiny 
<br />But then again you were for once not JUST part of a family 
<br />YOU were taken to one side and treated extra special 
<br />Must have been lovely 
<br />refreshing 
<br />An NOW you sit there at your keyboard gestating complaints 
<br />as your life is NOW dependant on you
<br />YOU got what you wanted 
<br />I even helped you when you packed your bags and had left
<br />Trying to humiliate me to make yourself seem so very big
<br />DID it work 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Did you even notice the looks from the people that helped you move
<br />I wonder
<br /><br />I suppose it makes it easier to cope .
<br />To rant on about stuff you say you had to deal with
<br />I remeber things differently.
<br /><br />Well if it works good luck .
<br /> Me I intend to get on with my life.
<br /> I like my name so I will keep it .
<br />If you  change yours I guess  to  pretend your somone else
<br />If thats what makes you feel like you are somthing that you are not.
<br />You can rave about the job you say your getting I wish you luck.
<br />But things dont always work out and remember what you say to people .
<br />I know the rest of us do.
<br />As you run out of family members you can trust and turn to 
<br />as their patience goes so thin with your behaviour 
<br />at least look at your life objectively and please realise why 
<br />I wish you all the very best for the future 
<br />stay safe 
<br /> I really do hope 
<br />your cartoon  imaginary world and your net friends 
<br />NEVER give you cause to cry or doubt 
<br /> I pray I'm wrong 
<br />I stand back 
<br />knowing your NOT nine years old 
<br />I was there at your birth 
<br /> Hoping  you will act much more grown up 
<br />When you need help 
<br />which you may 
<br />Lets hope theres somone there to lean on 
<br />All the best  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Now
<br /> we have to deal with the ss
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> not by choice mind 
<br /><br />But because THEY made themselves involved in OUR family. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />They can use their excuses <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Call people names  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />and try and use caring words and promise better done deeds ,
<br />But you know what 
<br />THEY are supposed to be the dedicated and professionally trained  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/book.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The government spend absolutely 
<br />THOUSANDS PER CHILD EACH YEAR  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Then My kid goes to another organisation the SS enrole 
<br />Who's responsible now
<br />its NOT EASY each say the other !
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />AND they say  have NO records of reports on a Childs activities
<br />Or reasons WHY  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />When it seems to suit them whilst in their care?
<br />DISGRACEFUL <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Parents have a right BY LAW to know how their kids are being looked after.
<br />Thats usually in with the court stuff after all 
<br />You wouldnt leave your kid with JUST ANYONE would you?
<br /><br />SURELY 
<br /><br />Be a bit like going paying for somthing and NOT knowing what your paying for
<br />Exactly WE pay OUR tax's which goes towards paying for this service........
<br />And since it cost so very much....!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />The  judge wouldnt make the rules if they even thought for one moment 
<br />The professionals did what they wanted and stuff the rules
<br /><br />I did originally approach theSocial services  numerous times
<br /> I knew absolutely I just couldn’t cope 
<br />Even begged my ex's mum 
<br />She didnt want to be involved!!!!
<br />She had her reasons I guess
<br />Lovely lady I miss her loads 
<br />But shes kinda in the middle so.......
<br />on the other hand I 
<br />Was getting ill 
<br />NO family to lean on at all 
<br />I had no life
<br />MY kids WERE my life
<br />I love em to bits  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> The Abusive ex who wouldn’t get lost, and didnt really want to commit
<br />(Looks good in front of your work mates )
<br />(saying all these kids are yours ...  your THE man )
<br /><br />HE will remember things ooh so differently I'll bet 
<br /><br />Full of promises of commitment and crocodile tears  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But basically far to full of HIS own importance  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />To really care at the time about anyone else 
<br />but HIS life 
<br />HIS work
<br />HIS car
<br />His training
<br />His professional seminars/ lunches/ suits etc
<br />HIS....   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/arrr.gif" alt=":)" />you get the picture 
<br />And there was ME  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" /> stupid forgiving mug 
<br />Always looking for the best in people and hoping the person I thought he was 
<br />Would turn out to be the person I thought I wanted
<br /><br />Somone who would NOT just say THEY would be around 
<br />But who would actually BE supportive NOT JUST when someone was looking.
<br />He led me to believe he was somthing else ....
<br />Nah I was a fool and I guess deep down I knew it even then . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But you get caught in &quot; the loop&quot; always looking for hope , always hoping when you look 
<br />But I plodded on as the time got worse, harder, I was getting more ill 
<br />NOT just the scars you see  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> Mentally and physically
<br />Exhausted  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />my family didn’t like him and I was alone.
<br />My few good  friends dropped like flies. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I didnt realise at the time the kids always came 1st.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So I struggled on trying to hold it together and I DID try  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Kept approaching the ss for help and guidance
<br />Id bitten off a great deal more than I could chew
<br />And didnt I know  it 
<br /><br />But it wasnt the kids fault 
<br />I needed 
<br /><br />Advice
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Some sleep would have been lovely
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Just a few hours 2, 3, all at once in a lump
<br />Would have been heaven <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/innocent.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />You cant imagine what having NO sleep can do to a person over a long period of time.
<br />Always putting others 1st as we do 
<br />Your judgment , behaviour, self esteme, confidence , 
<br />EVERYthing degrades
<br />EVEN your complexion and hair suffer..nails go like tissue
<br />I lost my nails at one point THEY were less than paper  Your diet suffers 
<br />You cant keep your food down so you DONT eat the same  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />In the mean time always wearing jumpers , and high collars
<br />Always pretending life was good 
<br />Always smiling <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hoping the neighbours dont see or school notice 
<br />trying to make the money go all round all the corners.
<br />(Must be EVEN HARDER  these days .)
<br /><br />Praying the kids DONT SEE YOU AS YOU REALLY ARE
<br />Thats the hardest  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Its a joke really because kids pick up on moods and tears so easily 
<br />you cant hide from THEM. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Trying to cope with half a dozen kids 
<br />One of which was VERY volatile 
<br />( <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wub.gif" alt=":)" />)
<br />2nd Oldest giving me real grief 
<br />And playing the grownups off against each other 
<br />And the system  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Still is  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Next one down full of mischief amd well
<br />you  get the picture 
<br />Baby ALWAYS crying the other 5 hadnt been like that 
<br />and me 
<br />Running back and forth to the docs 
<br />But THEY kept saying 
<br />All was well
<br />NAH
<br /> Youngest had been ill 
<br />RIGHT from the start.
<br />Turned out a long term illness , 
<br />But I found out much later
<br />When he was introduced to fast foods and crap packaged meals 
<br /><br />But were where the ss ?
<br />Oh they're great at being critical 
<br />For 3 years plus..
<br />TOOOOO DAM BUSY
<br />I kept asking , They kept saying we'll get back to you.. 
<br />yer right!
<br />This is how it works ... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/book.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The system excludes kids from school who have problems
<br />so they don’t have to look bad on the books I guess
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />It takes MONTHS to statement them
<br />NO funding until their statemented!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />THEY have to be IN school to get  accessed 
<br />Catch 22  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I once sat in a meeting from about 9 till after 1pm  
<br />surrounded by professionals who excelled shouting the merits of this particular school placement
<br />THEN hey I asked when can my kid go
<br />AHHH theres the catch NO one had the authority to get a place in the school ,
<br />And the school was so much in demand EVEN though it was in another county 
<br />It wasnt gonna happen ANYWAY 
<br />w.t.f?
<br /><br />Being a polite lady doesn’t help 
<br />I was usually quiet, polite, and easily fobbed off.
<br />So imagine when 
<br />My whole world collapsed 
<br />Broke my heart
<br />Ripped my world to see my children so frightened and so upset
<br />So lost 
<br />Placed among strangers
<br />They were so scared.
<br /><br />The kids unfortunately always the ones that hurt the most
<br />Had to go away
<br />Unpleasant circumstances forced the 
<br />TWO weeks so I could recover THEY said 
<br />Things would be resolved (THEY SAID).
<br />Amazing how  THEY CAN statement a kid when
<br /> THEY HAVE to 
<br />funding found! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />A child is worth 10.25 amd 9.25 there after
<br />per week
<br />But when their in care 
<br />50 pound shoes are cheap!
<br />How can a single parent compete!
<br /><br />I complained because 
<br />drugs are the norm
<br />Smoking is aceptable
<br />Sex at 13 is ...... suposed to be ok?
<br />I dont think so 
<br />Walking the streets on a rough estate at 2 in the morning 
<br />THATS NORMAL for a child?
<br /><br />I kept the records 
<br /> I kept EVERYTHING 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />its been nearly  10 flamin years 
<br />Heartbreaking.
<br />And the kids NOW 
<br />What a mess!
<br />WERE are MY loving family?
<br />WHO are these ANGRY mixed up ,messed up manipulitive  lost people ?
<br />who struggle in the real world?
<br />and tell me they just cant cope ?
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Now I'm truly lucky got my world back together 
<br /> I am safe, and in a stable VERY loving relationship 
<br /> Still struggle to sleep 
<br />My now hubby well, he’s my rock
<br />I know I'm lucky; he cares for my children and me....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" /> very supportive , and understanding and tolerant I guess  beyond words 
<br />But the ss
<br />Now they’re a different kettle of fish
<br />Rules were made to be broken 
<br />The law is meaningless
<br />We go hundreds of miles to sit in meetings
<br />That informs us of very little
<br />And don’t expect accurate minutes to meetings
<br />it wouldn’t look good I guess!
<br />They say the minutes together with the issues raised 
<br />Will be corrected
<br />Never are 
<br />And you cant get others involved or give out details 
<br />Against the rules
<br />Against the rules MY EYE!
<br /><br />Silly <strong> little </strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline"> things </span><strong> <em>like </em></strong>
<br />Oops my special needs kid gets a criminal record 
<br /><br />THEY FORGET TO TELL ME
<br /><br /><strong>IT SLIPED OUT.</strong>
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So you put the questions in writting 
<br /><br />We are promised regular updates
<br />One of these precious in depth full months updates are
<br />Left on a answer machine 
<br />MY kid is doing &quot;ok&quot;
<br />That’s it?
<br />I was lucky I got ANYTHING!
<br />So we complain again 
<br /> I FINALLY get some emails.
<br />But hey even HAVE  to pay postage to retrieve letters they send out to US 
<br />That tell us ZILCH wow some government body  THIS IS !
<br />VERY PROFESSIONAL 
<br /><br />Answers promised in Feb 06 
<br />STILL NOT answered
<br />How can a special needs child in the care of professionals
<br />Go out of THEIR care unsupervised and unmonitored 
<br />And THEY don’t know why?
<br />Especially AFTER THEY stress 
<br />My child HAS to be isolated until 
<br />The settle in period and monitoring is complete
<br />Disgraceful
<br />Were entitled to promised answers and 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ranting2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />WERE dam well getting them!!
<br /><br />We don’t have the money at the moment to take them back to court 
<br />so we KEEP going  through the complaints 
<br />How bizarre 
<br />The procedure states answered within 10 days 
<br />Huh No shit!!!!!
<br />Made a complaint in writing November 27th 07 
<br />STILL NO answers!
<br />We send in more forms 
<br />er.... NO answers 
<br />We have proof of postage so whats the problem
<br />I travel hundreds of miles and stick
<br />The complaints in their hands 
<br />er.... that was weeks and weeks and weeks ago!
<br />Any decent organisation would have 
<br />Sacked the staff for negligence by now 
<br />How bizarre..
<br />Do they STILL think I'm the easily led mouse I wonder.
<br /><br />Now I don’t for one minute believe all social workers 
<br />Are deliberately useless deceitful lazy morons? 
<br />whatever impression we seem to get 
<br />THEY have bosses TOO 
<br />Reasons for EVERY action right ?
<br /><br />Good and bad in all people .
<br />The latest Social worker seems to really be trying
<br />Seems to be a caring persoon who 
<br />IF i'm honest we cant agree on everything with 
<br />But she seems to have the childrens welfare at the front
<br />And seems to have been able to get 
<br />family to meet up
<br />That was amazing in itself.
<br />she answers like us all to her  boss !
<br />So it must have been a challenge .
<br /><br />But why have rules
<br />Can WE break them to?
<br />But THEN again I'm NOT good at lying 
<br />I have a conscience 
<br />If there’s a social worker that reads this 
<br />Please don’t just tick boxes and walk away 
<br /> I 'm sure you take on the job because you want to make a difference 
<br />LOOK at the subjects your dealing with 
<br />Please LOOK at the results of your work 
<br />Families deserve a future 
<br />Shouldn’t be simply &quot;to be seen to be&quot; box ticking 
<br />YOU HAVE IMPACT 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hey give yourself a treat look at the fruits of your work
<br />HOW much in employment
<br />HOW many can cope with simple tasks 
<br />Social skills? 
<br /><br />How many with criminal records?
<br /> I was in care it messed me up  for a while
<br />it made me the mouse I used to be 
<br /> and hey
<br />I even got THAT thrown back in MY face 
<br />NOT MY fault your organisation put ME in years ago in a bad enviroment  !!!!!
<br />Dont throw it in MY face 
<br />I turned out reasonable considering.
<br />and when a parent trys EVEN harder to make sure her kids are safe 
<br />YOU criticize? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />If you cant do as good a job as a parent 
<br />DONT promise YOU can.
<br />I went to see my kids(now adults) at Christmas 
<br />1st hot meal in months 
<br />And dont kid yourself 
<br /><br />Pot noodles are NOT a full balenced meal.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />If the social services can stand in the front of a que when kids do good 
<br />So you can promote the cause 
<br />Why cant YOU be there when THEY need you.?
<br />They cant cope with the upheaval you put them through 
<br />Acording to school records before they went
<br />top of class , punctual, hard working, bilingual
<br />Then the crap hits the fan and THEY get a better life.
<br />So they leave school uneducated and unskilled 
<br />Hows THAT work again please?
<br />Dont blame THAT on trauma  at home.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />They have NO patience and since they got fairly big 
<br />&quot;incentives&quot; 
<br />They cant function without them
<br /><br />But then what do I know 
<br />I was a single Mum , at the time on benefits
<br />little education myself 
<br />But if I was to offer advice to 
<br />ANY person is out there struggling and thinking of asking the social services for help
<br />DONT
<br />Go to family, a friend, the church,
<br />Women’s aid, gingerbread, join a support group    <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />,  
<br />ANYWERE but the S.S
<br />Put your kids 1st but DONT put em at risk!!!
<br />Just MY opinion just from our personal experience.
<br />The system offers  wonderful foster parents 
<br />real caring people who treasure your kids and put them 1st
<br />But then there are the abusers the manipulators 
<br />the pay morgage and get free holiday carers few and far between 
<br />but sad though it is I found out STILL out there .
<br />One of my kids EVEN  had foster parents that had to go to crown court for .....
<br />allegedly 17 yrs of &quot;interfering&quot; with girls in their care
<br />I spoke to some of the girls  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Somthing definetly happened They told me stuff
<br />The girls HAD talked to me as well as how I saw their behaviour change
<br />My oldest changed dramatically
<br />Never even been kissed before THAT placment!
<br />Never had a boyfriend 
<br />THEN had a pregnancy test for Chrimbo 
<br />Poor kid 
<br />Outcome to Court<em> <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>VERY private</strong> </span></em>
<br />I was told to leave the court
<br />Closed session!
<br />The carers got more protection than my the kids it seems
<br />THATS for sure. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />It was reported a Mrs Day of Louth who was found dead in her home in Louth 
<br />tottally despaired she felt she had no option other than to take her own life 
<br /><br />Her hubby it was reported to have  stated it was
<br /> the no CONSTANT PROMISES with NO  information 
<br />and her desperate worry and the trauma of their children going into care 
<br /> that he believed was the reason this happened 
<br />I know THAT feeling .
<br />Do you know that when a child is allowed their reports on request the ss can STILL
<br />with hold information on the grounds that person dosen't need to know ALL 
<br />the reasons stuff happens to them, or WHAT has happened to them?
<br />You know WHY kids are placed in certain places , or WHY with whom,
<br />whole records can be withheld because the social services 
<br />feel THEY dont have to disclose what has happened to that young person
<br />So carefully placed in their care.
<br />Mistakes CAN easily be buried then 
<br />and truths twisted within whole families because lies NOT corrected can be allowed 
<br />if its THEIR LIFE shouldnt THEY have all the facts.
<br /><br />IS THIS RIGHT?
<br /><br />So....on a much brighter note 
<br />Please 
<br /> Love your precious kids whatever...
<br />Looking back even the hard times have wonderful  laughs  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />No one can take those..!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />enjoy the good, try if you can to learn from the bad ,
<br />its part of life !
<br />and take as many vids and pics as you can cram in it all goes so fast.
<br />I STILL love my family beyond words ,
<br />We need to move on and stay strong 
<br /><br />We will keep fighting EVEN when all the kids have reached adulthood
<br />We will keep asking we want answers promised 
<br />A true parents obligations wont go away
<br />Even when we would like them to 
<br />As Children in care adults make mistakes 
<br />But when they learn from them and make your life as best they can 
<br />its somtimes not enough when others offer more 
<br />But is it for the right reasons?
<br />Look at those around you and take in all the facts
<br />Dont be like me and just take the ones that suit you and seem to make things easier.
<br />if its  not real or long term what will happen to you when no one is watching?
<br />Will you STILL be loved ?
<br /><br />To the professionals .
<br />If you dont know what your doing in your job or you CANT do it 
<br /><br />Please please get somone who IS capable 
<br /><br />Sorry  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />And we will keep hoping the world will NOT keep hurting those that need support the most
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /> I am dedicating this log to My best friend. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />We Have been mates since the day she walked into the charity shop <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> when I had just started work there some years ago 
<br />although  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />She would say I ran it (bless) <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br />She came over to U.K to be with her husband 
<br />He rebuilds and designs Apache Helicopters. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />She had alot of time on her hands and we got to go and do some fun stuff.
<br />She helped me put up shelves there,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We were a good team <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />If she had felt the job warrented her time she would get on with it.
<br /> I personally find it really hard to make friends and trust people. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I realised along time ago when people let you down,
<br />Lie to you,
<br />decieve you , <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />or just use you
<br /> the self defense bit in me 
<br />will not allow people to get to close.
<br />I am fragile. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We have alot in common , 
<br />Same interests, same caring personalities
<br />Both as gullible when it comes to those we loved. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/weirdo.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Both had the same problems in the past with other people.
<br />Then  my friend moved to the next county,
<br />Beautiful secluded spot 
<br />absoloutely stunning . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Her Hubby works/ plays hard...
<br />She became more and  dependant,
<br />More isolated <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />Left on her own 
<br />More concious of her limits <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />She has tried to correct things but.
<br />Flumoxed at every turn. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We havent worked together on a voluntry basis for a while 
<br />We went out for a bit when she moved  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Since I was in hospital it has been harder to travel as much 
<br />I am a bit more  limited 
<br />Just till I can get more of a handle on my own limitations.
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We  did the shopping thing, the play dress up thing
<br />She made my hubby a chillie to die for  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Her authentic home made cornbread was <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> a real treat.
<br />If he leaves me  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/crazylove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Who ever he runs to had better learn to cook THAT  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />She has been battling with health issues for some time
<br />Been on her own for many hours every day , 
<br />No transport   <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Crap bus service, the village she moved to 
<br />main bit hell of a walk away I'm told.
<br />A death in the family means she had to go back .
<br />She is completely heartbroken  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I feel so helpless...! 
<br />All I do will not bring them back 
<br />She was thousands of miles away when they past over .
<br />The guilt is overwelming. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I'm sure they will understand.
<br />I'm sure they have a hand in her going back
<br />Knowing how her life has been for her since she came here.
<br />It is for the best and she knows it 
<br />but 
<br /> I will miss her .
<br />She has been a good laugh .
<br />she has been a true friend 
<br />Not many ladies go to beer festivals who cant stand beer . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The floating plants we tipped the &quot;samples&quot; in  were really funny 
<br />We had a great laff ,ate out ,  stayed out late ,
<br />and did the girlie stuff  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />I could never do when my kids were young.
<br />Well My kids always came 1st 
<br />No social life.
<br />My last relationship was so restricted I didnt have the luxury of friendships
<br />My ex managed to spoil each and every one . <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> So I miss her already 
<br />She has been a real influance  in helping me realise the person that I am 
<br />Has given me the strength to stand up for my beliefs 
<br />And has helped  bring me back out of my shell.
<br />I spent absolutely ages looking for an appropriate  card to send her home with.
<br /><br />I have emailed her
<br />We will talk on the telephone.
<br />One day I honestly hope we can go and visit her in the U.S.A.
<br />The family she will face,
<br />The funeral she must handle 
<br />And all the other stuff she must resolve in the next few weeks.
<br />May her handbag swing in the warmest wind. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />What to do friday was going to get some gardening done
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ninja.gif" alt=":)" />but the rain has kind of put the dampeners on actually 
<br />Getting anything accomplished outside  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So we stayed inside got up late <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Well chest pains were REALLY bad  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh2.gif" alt=":)" />so I couldn’t do to much,
<br />We watched a bit o TV.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I repaired one of the statues in the garden 
<br />re-attached the hose 
<br />(Bit saucy)
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And THEN we settled down to play a game of 
<br /><br />&quot;Strip worms&quot;
<br /><br />He decided HE wasn’t going to lose THIS one so tells me HE'S 
<br /> off he goes to the bathroom <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And comes down with boxer shorts socks slippers and a wrist watch on.!
<br />Grrr <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So I tells 's him 
<br />I need the bathroom!
<br />(two can play at THAT game!) 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/rock.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I goes upstairs to  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />&quot;the bathroom&quot;
<br />And comes down  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> with 
<br />&quot;pig tails &quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> and multiple hair bobbles <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />4 summer tops..... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fart.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />various items of jewellery 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/holmes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And layers of thongs and knickers  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I DEFINETLY dont want to  lose THIS game  
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cold.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We play I get the holy hand grenade out  
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He lands a brown sofa on my worm
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I misfire my&quot;knee trembler&quot;
<br />He throws a flying sheep at me 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He's laughing almost as loudly as me 
<br />HOW daft can you get  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />So ,,,, getting after midnight and 
<br />AH......HA..
<br />I see bare-naked toes 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />It got too much for me so 
<br />We decide its &quot; bedtime&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Up early we were supposed to be going to 
<br />Canterbury...
<br />Nah where’d we go 
<br />Norwich.
<br />He decides were going to sample the delights of a pub or two and go shopping!
<br /> I can’t really drink...&quot;meds&quot; grrr.
<br />So we go shopping.
<br />I finally manage to find a lovely card to send to one of my kids
<br />(They’ve just got their 1st real home)
<br />Suddenly  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> his nibs spots a house warming gift 
<br />&quot;its perfect&quot;
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He takes me back to some pub somewhere and we have a spot of refreshments
<br />On to another to find the elusive bar billiards table
<br />We hardly EVER get to go out so  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Omg!!!! 
<br />we were discussing
<br /><br />&quot;strip billiards&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />He’s at it again he’s going to WIN this one  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fool.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />So we get on the table a couple of nice blokes 
<br />&quot;Coach&quot; me at the rules and off we go..
<br /><br />No here’s the thing you can rack up several hundred points on this thing 
<br />But if you knock some sticks (mushrooms) that are in the middle of table
<br />You loose points
<br />You can loose ALL your points.
<br /> Of course I was totally rubish  at it 
<br />What a surprise.
<br /> 1st game....
<br />Won
<br />2nd game he’s up to 400 and something 
<br />AHHHHH he hits the wrong mushroom again 
<br />I WIN 
<br />3rd game he’s getting better
<br />300, 460, yep relentless 
<br />The table locks down he’s smiling I have 30 points ......
<br />er... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />. THEN
<br /><br />THEM dam mushrooms  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I win  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Thank god we didn’t go for the &quot;strip game &quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/fancy.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />End of the day he insists we go back to the local for a quickie .
<br />Had second tel call of the day from another of my offspring
<br />Informing me the rice pudding he was trying to make
<br />was a success I was pleased for him.
<br /><br />It got late we'd spoken to our friends 
<br />Seen the drunken parties of people doing the pub crawl
<br />Of course when I was told by hubby 
<br />THERE WAS a man dressed as a vicar 
<br />carrying a full sized cross
<br />and acompanied by numerous &quot;nuns&quot; in mini skirts
<br />I didnt look
<br />I didnt look when HE told me one was wearing suspenders
<br />But WHEN he told me the one in suspenders 
<br />WAS a bloke  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Of course I HAD to peek  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We talked as we watched another fella 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> the man wobbled  down the street 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br />As he stumbled in the distance 
<br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Falling into shop doorways ....
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />and bouncing off the shop windows
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />oh boy WAS I cringing
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But apparently 
<br />THATS normal..!
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He seemed ok!
<br />I was told ok we can go now 
<br />Seen enough!!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />and I could go to bed.
<br /> Yesterday although I wasnt were I'd have like to have been .
<br />It was nice 
<br />Maybe another week hubby will stop worrying
<br />and I can go on my own to see family for the day.
<br />Ah well ...
<br />We'll see what the doc says this week and take it from there ....
<br />Hope you have a good week too 
<br />Best wish's  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Humm lots been going on last few weeks 
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Good and bad things I guess.
<br /><br />Where to begin.... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/book.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Spoke to a good friend long heart to heart to try and help her 
<br />She’s been going through a really tough time and I guess the shoulder to cry on was useful  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />And I guess I felt rather superior as I felt my life is going reasonably good.
<br /><br />Err... 
<br />TOO SOON!!!!!!
<br /><br />1stly we had the death of a friend.
<br />We were aware there was a problem with cancer in / out of remission.
<br />But it still hit hard....
<br />Really hard....
<br />But ... its part of the circle of life right...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blink.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Then.
<br />My Hubbys dad dies  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />We knew he was terminally ill with Alzheimers 
<br />But...
<br /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />There was a rushed post mortem.
<br />He was lucky I guess <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Least THAT’S what I keep telling hubby 
<br />His dad felt bit off
<br />Went for a lay down
<br />And passed away 
<br />In his sleep 
<br />Heart attack!!! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />So hubby about to go to work on nights 
<br />Gets a call from me!  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />After I'd gone through a series of emergency telephone numbers.
<br /><br />A task in itself....
<br />Because ALL calls are monitored and highly monitored because of 
<br />The terror risk thing  
<br />How do you get to say what the problem is without mentioning a death in the family?
<br />So back he comes on the long journey home.
<br />My poor Nephew was devastated
<br />Heartbroken.
<br />We sat on the phone talking in tears.!
<br /><br />We got through the last few weeks 
<br />Poor hubby.
<br />We’ve had to sort out his Mams financial / legal stuff
<br />Shes a mess!
<br />It’s still ongoing.
<br />The bit that hit my hubby most was....
<br /><br />He was ALWAYS going to make time to spend with his Dad
<br />But...
<br /><br />Work; travel to and from work, ...hobby, and the other demands 
<br />Left him asleep on his time off.
<br />He KEPT meaning to make time but...
<br />A mistake I hope someone reading this 
<br />may not  make with their loved ones !
<br /><br />And here’s me seen his Dad loads more  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Simply because I filled in the few gaps
<br /> When his Dad needed running around or..
<br />If I took him for walks to docs, bit of shopping ...out for a giggle
<br />Just to take him for a long loooong walk for a cuppa, and munch
<br />To give Hubbys Mam a break....
<br />If I'm honest I quite enjoyed it.
<br />He really was a lovely gentle  man.
<br />But I'm sure the fact the deterioration of his dad’s health due to the illness 
<br />Must have been really hard to come to terms with,
<br />The picture I took at the birthday party sat proudly on the coffin.
<br />Apparently the VERY best photo the family  could find 
<br />with a genuine heart warming proud to be here cheshire cat smile on.
<br />Captured his cheeky grin VERY well!
<br />But the funeral , wake, and the spreading of the ashes is finally over 
<br />life goes on.
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />To top this off 
<br />One of my sons (now 20 years young).
<br />Decided to be a prize idiot!
<br />He has a hobby I cant approve of.
<br />NO denying that.
<br />He EVEN  told me all about it.
<br /> I’ve seen the result.
<br />But I love him 
<br />He’s an idiot, but he’s my son.
<br /><br />I knew we were having a tough time of it and he asked me for some money.
<br />At the time 
<br /> I couldn’t help
<br />I really couldn’t.
<br /><br />I didn’t tell my son but we were struggling a bit ourselves.
<br />Well if as he tells me he can afford<span style="text-decoration:underline"> his</span> hobby...
<br /><br />He told me it didn’t matter later 
<br />Apparently I ONLY gives him &quot;tatt&quot;
<br />Well over the last few years everything from books a bookcase gothic bits and bobs , And box's and box's of videos ,I spent £70 in petrol to take a tv down worth £25 just to see him and try and help! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Hubby had to help me out of the car my body had crampped up so bad. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I couldnt walk next day as the long journey stuck in traffic had taken its toll on my old spinal injury <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But at the time I said very little !
<br /> I’ve managed to give him a leather coat 
<br />Brand new that had originally been a whopping   £799 price tag on.
<br />Though I didn’t pay that!
<br />I got him a second hand gigging amp I priced them up in Denmark Street London
<br />There over £400 new!.
<br />This doesn’t include the entire solid &quot;bling&quot; he’s had over the years.
<br /> I didn’t EVEN get a free text wishing me well on me birthday.
<br />Few weeks later another son appeals for help to buy a heater.
<br /> Hubby was actually in a almost good mood and just happened to have given me the monthly housekeeping 
<br />So next day I transfer the money to this sons account (early Chrimbo pressy.)
<br />Unfortunately I have been unwell so been on the painkillers and sleeping a lot more.
<br />Had a couple of days of in bed and on fluids.
<br />Imagine my shock when I do get up and check the telephone.
<br />Apparently the son that I couldn’t help financially left a load of abuse on my mobile.
<br />He’s changing HIS last name to HIS fathers  ...
<br />That'l please his Dad.
<br />(Should get him a exspensive Chrimbo pressy of his mug of a daddykins )
<br />aparently I'm a crap Mum! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Partly I'm disgusted with him partly I'm appalled. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But looking at the text I can see WHY people would think badly of me.
<br /> It answered a lot of questions I’ve had for years.
<br />I had problems with the social services and was accused of some horrible things.
<br /> I didn’t understand HOW I could be accused of such rubbish!
<br />NOW I understand.
<br />I looked at the text apparently I was horrible.
<br />And I'm in denial...
<br />Uh huh
<br /><br />He didn’t get his own way years ago,
<br />And He didn’t get his own way now...
<br />And YES 
<br />I can look back on my life 
<br />Which WAS a living HELL and say I did MY best
<br />I tried MY hardest.
<br />I DID TRY to be the VERY BEST Mum I could be.
<br />I failed
<br /> But I tried.
<br />My thoughts analyse everything NOW 
<br />And as hubby points out 
<br />In ALL the time he’s known me
<br /> and the stuff we've been through
<br />Were an even stronger couple for it <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/hug.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />He saw home family videos of me and my kids ,
<br />Before we got married and HE  
<br />Doesn’t recognise ANY of the criteria that he saw in the text.
<br />He is sad and ashamed for me. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/confused2.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/badboy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Completely disgusted  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />and VERY angry at the son
<br />As this son has tried to manipulate over the last few years 
<br />He Braggs about &quot;ruling the family&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />How HE scared his sister,  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />and get EVERYONE to do as HE pleases <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/evileyes.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />After HIS entire dad always sucks up to him in the end. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I don’t want to play. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />Maybe I can’t stand the person his dads become  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/huh.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But you STILL don’t treat people like THAT! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_down.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Hubby has been my shoulder and my rock. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/inlove.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I know I frustrate him when I have refused to turn my back on this family
<br />And he’s Real  pissed at the son that has been stirring it up!
<br /> I've been ill, We have been dealing with so very much, But .....
<br /> I still love them all!
<br /><br />Considering myself lucky. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I do not get abused in ANY way
<br />I feel loved, safe, and as for the &quot;meal ticket&quot;  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbs_up.gif" alt=":)" />of a hubby 
<br />Christ if my kids ONLY KNEW  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I am blessed at having <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/girly.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />The friendship and support of someone I both care about  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/celebrate.gif" alt=":)" />and admire. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/thumbsup.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /> I DONT have things easy.
<br />Typical day for me is long, hardworking, and demanding.
<br />Both mentally and physically 
<br />Few people would queue up to walk in my shoes. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing2.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />I ask for very little!
<br /> But I wish this son would just  listen to himself sometimes
<br />All the best stay safe , but will NOT share in this spiteful delusion.
<br />If he EVER decides he wanted to talk <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />RESPECTFULLY he knows I am a call away. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/ohmy.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But please I have feelings to!
<br /><br />Christmas is looking like a family tug of war 
<br />We can all do without at the moment.
<br />We all know the ex is obviously trying to look good in front of the social services .
<br />Nothing new there then.
<br />Pity the kids are still in the middle  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br />But they are growing up .
<br />Time in these conditions is definetly having an effect.
<br />The results are really sad 
<br />Social services are so blinkered what a waste of public funds .
<br /> Do they EVER do what THEY SAY on the tin...? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyway enough this blog has been long to catch up with all the weeks I missed.
<br />Have a great day world  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/flowers.gif" alt=":)" />
