<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 7, almost a week down!  The first six days went pretty smoothly.  I can take a moment and appreciate all the effort and discipline I’ve needed to get this far with the Ultimate Reset. Is the program starting to feel easier? Let’s find out how Day 7 of the Ultimate Reset went!<br /><br />Ultimate Reset – THE JOURNEY – Day 7<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not sleep well at all last night.  I did get out of bed, but, I just plopped on the couch for awhile because I was so tired.  Eventually, I got up and made a glass of distilled water with Mineralize and Oxygenize.  I also took the two Optimize capsules.  I am definitely getting used to the Ultimate Reset supplements.  Tomorrow starts the Detox supplement and I’m a little nervous about that.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the breakfast on Day 7 of the Ultimate Reset, OATMEAL.  I cooked up some oatmeal with distilled water, added a couple of tablespoons of flax seed, some cinnamon and a chopped up Granny Smith apple. It was prett

<br /><br />Fattest Cities – Richmond, is it true? YES!<br />I cannot believe it!<br /><br />Well, according to Newsweek’s TheDailyBeast.com, Richmond placed second in the list of the fattest cities!<br /><br />That is NOT something I want Richmond to be known for! Our state slogan is “Virginia Is For Lovers” NOT “Virginia Is For The Obese“!<br /><br />With a state slogan of “Everything’s Bigger In Texas“, you would expect some cities from Texas to be on the top 10 list of the fattest cities and you would be right! San Antonio, Texas is ranked as third for the fattest cities in America. But, the Fattest Cities – Richmond, come on!<br /><br />Fattest Cities – Richmond – Specific Numbers<br /><br />What are the specific numbers for Richmond?<br /><br />% of population that is obese: 29.4<br />% of population with diabetes: 9.9<br />% of population that exercises frequently: 50.2<br />% of population that eats produce regularly: 58.1<br /><br />We have some work to do Richmond!<br /><br />Let’s END THE TREND of obesity in Richmond!<br /><br />Fattest Cities – Richmond – It Made

<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 8, Phase 2 and I messed up! No, it isn’t what you are thinking, I didn’t cheat. Just messed up. We’ll get to it. I’ll give you a hint, it is because it is a new phase of the Ultimate Reset. Let’s find out what happened on Day 8 of the Ultimate Reset!<br /><br />Ultimate Reset – THE JOURNEY – Day 8<br /><br />I did get some decent sleep last night, but I was still tired this morning. I had a follow-up chiropractor appointment this morning, but I did NOT want to get out of bed. So I turned off the alarm and dozed in and out for about 30 minutes. Then I had to rush to get out the door to make the appointment on time. Typical, right? I did have enough time to start the day with the distilled water, Mineralize, Oxygenize and Optimize. (Did you notice something missing<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /><br /><br />When I got back home, I was HUNGRY!

<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 9 went smoothly. I didn’t forget any supplements, I was able to stay on track, AND, I found another GREAT Ultimate Reset recipe. This may not surprise you, but it is REALLY surprising me that I am not only making these recipes, eating these recipes, BUT also, LOVING these recipes! The Ultimate Reset has definitely introduced some things into our family’s food habits that are going to be sticking around! Thank you Ultimate Reset! Let’s see how Day 9 unfolded…<br /><br />Ultimate Reset – THE JOURNEY – Day 9<br /><br />I slept pretty well last night and felt pretty good in the morning, but I still didn’t want to get out of bed. It wasn’t that I was so tired I didn’t want to get up, it was just that I was comfortable and sleeping well is just a WONDERFUL experience!<br /><br />I rolled out of bed and headed to the kitchen. I got all FOUR supplements out and started on them. First up was Detox. It wasn’t so bad today, since I knew what to expect. It STILL isn’t the best thing, b

<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 10 and I’m about halfway through it! I am surprised at how well this journey is going. I’ve gotten into the habit of eating well, drinking that distilled water, taking the Ultimate Reset supplements and staying on track! I’ve been faced with temptation and overcame obstacles. I see a difference on the scale and I can see a difference in the midsection. Thank you Ultimate Reset! Let’s see how Day 10 progressed.
<br /><br />Ultimate Reset – THE JOURNEY – Day 10
<br />I went to bed earlier than usual last night and got an AWESOME nights sleep! I actually didn’t set my alarm last night, but I didn’t have to. Why? Because the kids were my alarm. All 3 of them ran in and jumped on us! THAT WAS OUR WAKE UP CALL! They wanted their Shakeology! My wife started on their shakes and I started on the Ultimate Reset supplements. Mixed up a small glass of Detox. I’ve already gotten use to the taste. Still isn’t my favorite but it is doable. Then the tall glass of distilled w

<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 11 and THE HALFWAY POINT! I had another great day of Ultimate Reset meals and am feeling great. The supplementation has become second nature. The only “nature” issues are the number of times I have to go to the bathroom because my “eyes were floating”. Hydration is VERY important, especially with a detox like the Ultimate Reset. So, I’ll deal with it. Onto Day 11…<br /><br />Ultimate Reset – THE JOURNEY – Day 11<br /><br />I had another great night of sleep. I don’t wake up tired, just very comfortable. No “kid” alarm today.

<br /><br />Ultimate Reset Day 12, Friday, thank goodness! Past the halfway point and headed to the weekend. So far the journey hasnt been very bumpy. I havent experience headaches, bathroom issues or skins rashes. All of those things are symptoms of your body releasing toxins. Maybe I didnt have as many toxins in my body as I thought? Either way, I am still going strong with the Ultimate Reset. Lets see what happened on Day 12!Ultimate Reset  THE JOURNEY  Day 12I didnt sleep as well as the past couple of nights. I rolled out of bed and my morning ritual takes me to the kitchen. I mix up a small glass of Detox which tastes much better to me now (better than Alkanalize). Afterwards, I make the large glass of distilled water with with Mineralize, Oxygenize and Optimize. With all that 37 degree water I got a little chill, so I put on a jacket while I waited for the Ultimate Reset breakfast.On the menu for this morning was fruit. Of course that means that Im having

<br /><br />Jump-start weight loss.Yep, everyone wants a jump-start.Especially, when there is an upcoming event or if you have hit a plateau.When it comes to diet and exercise, everyone would like to see some results!And there is nothing wrong with that! You SHOULD see some results.But, what if you have hit a plateau? What if you need to jump-start weight loss?Jump-Start Weight Loss  The Answer!Hitting a plateau in your results can be very discouraging. Making slight adjustments to your diet can usually help push you through, jump-start weight loss and see results again. But, what if those slight adjustments arent helping?To jump-start weight loss or to break a plateau, a well timed 3 day Shakeology cleanse can help you see results in a healthy way. Why do I say well timed? Well, you do NOT want to do a 3 day Shakeology cleanse when you are REALLY pushing yourself. If you are in the middle of an intense program, that is NOT the time to do a cleanse.Jump-Start Weight L
