<br />I yearn for your warm embrace
<br />For the way your hands caress me
<br />Take me to a secret place
<br />Where no one else can take me
<br />You have my very soul
<br />My body’s screaming out to you
<br />Take me now my love
<br />Your eyes how they mesmerize
<br />I see to the core of you
<br />The passion that you have for me
<br />No doubt your love is true
<br />Why can’t we be one?
<br />Intertwined
<br />I crave to indulge in your love
<br />Never to break free
<br />Embrace me now my love
<br />No longer can I wait
<br />To feel your arms around me
<br />Hold me close for heavens sake ...

<br /><br />Sometimes we lose someone by saying
<br />I LOVE YOU
<br />But,
<br />more often we lose someone, by fearing to say,
<br />I LOVE YOU.

<br />Drifting on galactic winds
<br />Exploring the vast universe
<br />Learning the ways of being
<br />How things come together and disperse
<br /><br />My navigation must have been broke
<br />Cause something made go of track
<br />Didn't know what it was
<br />Didn't know how to get back
<br />This thing must be immense
<br /><br />Then I saw it out my cockpit
<br />This massive star
<br />Brightest you have ever seen
<br />Shining it's light on me
<br />Made me feel warmer than I had ever been
<br /><br />It drew me closer and closer
<br />Using its massive gravity
<br />Wanted me to land on her
<br />So I could plant my flag
<br />And truly call her mine
<br /><br />But I yanked the steering wheel
<br />Made a U-turn
<br />Sorry baby this is not how I feel
<br />I need to stay in space
<br />And remain in zero gravity

<br />I'm really trying to say so much
<br />more than those three little words.
<br />I'm trying to say you mean more to
<br />me than anyone else in the world.
<br />I'm trying to let you know that I adore you
<br />and that I cherish the time we spend together.
<br />I'm trying to explain that I want you and that I need you
<br />and that I get lost in wonderful
<br />thoughts every time I think about you.
<br />And each time I whisper&quot;I love you&quot;,
<br />I'm trying to remind you that you're
<br />the best thing that has ever happened to me ?
