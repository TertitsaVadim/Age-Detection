<br /><br /><strong>Roger Federer's historic French open win Sunday has gone down so well among the sport's enthusiasts that even Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan couldn't stop drawing parallel between himself and the Swiss.
<br /><br />The 27-year-old is infamous for shedding tears after winning a trophy and Aamir thinks even he does the same after his films do well at the box office.
<br /><br />&quot;Federer finally wins the French Open. I'm so happy for him... But he is certainly the only one to cry like a baby each times he wins a final! Thats one thing I share in common with him. I cry like hell each time any of my films does well, but I also cry when they don't, &quot; Aamir posted on his blog on Tuesday (June 9) afternoon.
<br /><br />Federer created tennis history when he defeated Robin Soderling 6-1, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 and won the French Open title to become the sixth man in tennis history to win all four majors.
<br /><br />Federer also joined Pete Sampras as the biggest winner ever in the sport and the latter even went on record to say that the former went on to earn the title of &quot;best tennis player in history&quot;, even before winning the Roland Garros.
<br /><br />Aamir, however, is against such titles.
<br /><br />&quot;Sampras says he (Federer) is the best ever tennis player in history. I'm not sure if there is such a thing. Quite frankly each of the leading players of their time were equally difficult to beat. (Bjorn) Borg, Sampras himself, not to mention (Rod) Laver, &quot; Aamir further wrote. </strong>

<br /><br />The wedding comes about two weeks after his 4 year-old daughter, Exodus, from another woman died in what police described as an accident at her Arizona home. The youngster was choked by a cord from a treadmill.
<br /><br />Tyson's marriage to Spicer took place on Saturday in a private ceremony at the La Bella Wedding Chapel, its owner Shawn Absher told Reuters.
<br /><br />&quot;No guests whatsoever, just the bride and groom,&quot; Absher said. &quot;Very intimate, sincere. Mike seemed very happy.&quot;
<br /><br />Tyson's union with Spicer is his third marriage. He was previously married for one year to actress Robin Givens and for five years to a doctor, Monica Turner.
<br /><br />He retired from boxing in 2005 after a career marked by controversy.
<br /><br />Tyson, 42, has a cameo in comedy &quot;The Hangover,&quot; which opened on Friday and was the No. 1 movie at U.S. and Canada box offices over the weekend with nearly $45 million.[/b]

A number of psychological experiments over the years have yielded terrifying conclusions about the subjects.
<br /><br />Oh, we're not talking about the occasional psychopath who turns up. No, we're talking about you. The experiments speak for themselves:
<br /><br />#5. The Asch Conformity Experiment (1953)
<br /><br />The Setup: Solomon Asch wanted to run a series of studies that would document the power of conformity, for the purpose of depressing everyone who would ever read the results.
<br /><br />Subjects were told that they would be taking part in a vision test, along with a handful of people. The participants were then shown pictures, and individually asked to answer very simple and obvious questions. The catch was that everybody else in the room other than the subject was in on it, and they were were told to give obviously wrong answers. So would the subject go against the crowd, even when the crowd was clearly and retardedly wrong?
<br /><br />The Result: Questions the subjects were asked were like the puzzle shown here:</strong>
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/83371105_354503_23910556.jpg" />
<br /><br />[b]All they had to do was say which line on the right matched the one on the left. As you can see, Asch wasn't exactly asking these people to design the next space station. Really, the only way you could get the line questions honestly wrong is if you took two doses of LSD that morning and rubbed them directly on your eyeballs (which would have made for an even more awesome experiment, but we're getting off the point).
<br /><br />Yet, sadly, 32 percent of subjects would answer incorrectly if they saw that three others in the classroom gave the same wrong answer. Even when the line was plainly off by a few inches, it didn't matter. One in three would follow the group right off the proverbial cliff.
<br />What This Says About You: Imagine how much that 32 percent figure inflates when the answers are less black and white. We all tend to laugh with the group even when we didn't get the joke, or doubt our opinion we realize ours is unpopular among our group. So much for those lectures you got in elementary school about peer pressure and &quot;being brave enough to be yourself.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, it's a good thing I'm a rebellious non-conformist,&quot; many of you are saying. Of course, for virtually all of you, the next step is to find out what the other non-conformists are doing ...
<br /><br />... and make sure you conform to it perfectly.
<br /><br />#4. The Good Samaritan Experiment (1973)
<br /><br />The Setup: The Biblical story of the Good Samaritan, if you hadn't heard, is about a passing Samaritan helping an injured man in need, while other, self-righteous types walk right on by. Psychologists John Darley and C. Daniel Batson wanted to test if religion has any effect on helpful behavior.
<br /><br />Their subjects were a group of seminary students. Half of the students were given the story of the Good Samaritan and asked to perform a sermon about it in another building. The other half were told to give a sermon about job opportunities in a seminary.
<br /><br />As an extra twist, subjects were given different times that they had to deliver the sermon so that some would be in a hurry and others not.
<br /><br />Then, on the way to the building, subjects would pass a person slumped in an alleyway, who looked to be in need of help. We like to think Darley and Batson beat the crap out of some random dude to make it more realistic, but sources say otherwise.
<br /><br />The Result: The people who had been studying the Good Samaritan story did not stop any more often than the ones preparing for a speech on job opportunities. The factor that really seemed to make a difference was how much of a hurry the students were in.
<br /><br />In fact, if pressed for time, only 10 percent would stop to give any aid, even when they were on their way to give a sermon about how awesome it is for people to stop and give aid. Though to be fair, if you were late for a class, did your professor ever accept, &quot;I had to stop and help a wounded traveler&quot; as an excuse? Probably not unless you could produce the guy's blood-stained shirt as evidence.
<br /><br />What This Says About You: As much as we like to make fun of, say, anti-gay congressmen who get caught gaying it up in a men's bathroom and pointing out Al Gore's resource-hogging mansion ...
<br /><br />... the truth is us common folk are just as likely to be hypocrites as the politicians. After all, it's much easier to talk to a room full of people about helping strangers than, say, actually touching a smelly and bleeding homeless man. So even pointing out their hypocrisy becomes a form of hypocrisy.
<br /><br />And in case you thought these results were just restricted to hypocritical seminary students, turn on the news. Remember a few years ago when cameras captured at least a dozen cars refusing to stop for an injured woman laying in the road?
<br /><br />Just like the students, they all had to be somewhere. The drivers were presumably proud enough of themselves just for swerving to miss her, rather than squishing her like roadkill.
<br /><br />#3. Bystander Apathy Experiment (1968)
<br /><br />The Setup: When a woman was murdered in 1964, newspapers printed that 38 people had heard and seen the attack, but did nothing. John Darley and Bibb Latane wanted to know if the fact that these people were in a large group played any role in the reluctance to come to aid.
<br /><br />The two psychologists invited volunteers to take part in a discussion. They claimed that because the discussion would be extremely personal (probably asking about the size of their genitals or something) individuals would be separated in different rooms and talk to each other using an intercom.
<br /><br />During the conversation, one of the members would fake an epileptic seizure, which could be heard on the speakers. We're not completely sure how they conveyed over the intercom that what was happening was a seizure, but we're assuming the words &quot;Wow this is quite an epileptic seizure I'm having&quot; were uttered.
<br /><br />The Result: When subjects believed that they were the only other person in the discussion, 85 percent were heroic enough to leave the room and seek help once the other began the fake seizure. This makes sense. Having an extremely personal conversation (again, presumably about tiny genitalia) with another person is difficult enough, but being forced to continue to carry on the conversation by yourself is just sad. But either way, 85 percent helped. So that's good, right?
<br /><br />Well, they weren't done. When the experiment was altered so that subjects believed four other people were in the discussion, only 31 percent went to look for help once the seizure began. The rest assumed someone else would take care of it. So the phrase, &quot;The more, the merrier&quot; somehow got lost in translation because the correct expression should be, &quot;The more, the higher probability that you will die if you have a seizure.&quot;
<br /><br />What This Says About You: Obviously if there's an emergency and you're the only one around, the pressure to help out increases massively. You feel 100 percent responsible for what happens. But, when you're with 10 other people, you're only 10 percent as responsible. The problem is everybody else only feels 10 percent responsible too.
<br /><br />This sheds some light on our previous examples. Maybe the drivers who swerved around the injured woman in the road would have stopped if they'd been alone on a deserted highway. Then again, maybe they'd be even more likely to abandon her since they know nobody is watching (unlike the people in the experiment, who at least knew there were others around to judge their actions).
<br /><br />Or maybe it comes down to just how plausible an excuse we can make for ourselves. &quot;Surely someone will come along and save the lady in the road,&quot; we say. Or, &quot;Surely someone else will do something about the environment,&quot; or &quot;Surely the shark will get full and stop eating that dude at some point.&quot; We just need the slightest excuse to do nothing.
<br /><br />#2. The Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)
<br /><br />The Setup: Psychologist Philip Zimbardo wanted to find out how captivity affects authorities and inmates in prison. Sounds innocent enough. Seriously, what could go wrong?
<br /><br />Zimbardo transformed the Stanford Psychology Department's basement into a mock prison. Subjects volunteered by simply responding to a newspaper ad and then passing a test proving good health and high-quality mental stability, which are very important factors in deciding who goes to prison. These volunteers were all male college students who were then divided arbitrarily into 12 guards and 12 prisoners. Zimbardo himself decided that he wanted to play too, and elected himself Prison Superintendent. The simulation was planned to run for two weeks.
<br /><br />Yep, nothing at all can go wrong with this.
<br /><br />The Result: It took about one day for every subject to suddenly go as insane as a shit-house rat. On only the second day, prisoners staged a riot in the faux detention center, with prisoners barricading their cells with their beds and taunting the guards. The guards saw this as a pretty good excuse to start squirting fire extinguishers at the insurgents because, hey, why the hell not?
<br /><br />From that point on, the Stanford Prison that had already gone to hell, just continued to ricochet around in hell for day after day. Some guards began forcing inmates to sleep naked on the concrete, restricting the bathroom as a privilege (one that was often denied). They forced prisoners to do humiliating exercises and had them clean toilets with their bare hands.
<br /><br />Incredibly, when &quot;prisoners&quot; were told they had a chance at parole, and then the parole was denied, it didn't occur to them to simply ask out of the damned experiment. Remember they had absolutely no legal reason to be imprisoned, it was just a role-playing exercise. This fact continued to escape them as they sat naked in their own filth, with bags on their heads.
<br /><br />Over 50 outsiders had stopped to observe the prison, but the morality of the trial was never questioned until Zimbardo's girlfriend, Christina Maslach, strongly objected. After only six days, Zimbardo put a halt to the experiment (several of the &quot;guards&quot; expressed disappointment at this). If you were about to applaud Maslach as the only sane person involved in this clusterfuck, you should know that she went on to marry Zimbardo, the guy who orchestrated the whole thing.
<br /><br />What This Says About You: Ever been harassed by a cop who acted like a major douchebag, pushing you around for no reason? Science says that if the roles were reversed, you'd likely act the same way.
<br /><br />As it turns out, it's usually fear of repercussion that keeps us from torturing our fellow human beings. Give us absolute power over somebody and a blank check from our superiors, and Abu Ghraib-esque naked pyramids are sure to follow. Hey, if it can happen to a bunch of Vietnam-era hippie college students, it sure as hell could happen to you.
<br /><br />#1. The Milgram Experiment (1961)
<br /><br />The Setup: When the prosecution of the Nazis got underway at the Nuremberg Trials, many of the defendants' excuse seemed to revolve around the ideas of, &quot;I'm not really a prick&quot; and, &quot;Hey man, I was just following orders.&quot; Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram wanted to test willingness of subjects to obey an authority figure. Maybe he could just, you know, ask people? Oh, hell no. That would not be nearly horrifying enough.
<br /><br />Instead he ran an experiment where the subject was told he was a &quot;teacher&quot; and that his job was to give a memory test to another subject, located in another room. The whole thing was fake and the other subject was an actor.
<br /><br />The subject was told that whenever the other guy gave an incorrect answer, he was to press a button that would give him an electric shock. A guy in a lab coat was there to make sure he did it (again no real shock was being delivered, but the subject of course did not know this).
<br /><br />The subject was told that the shocks started at 45 volts and would increase with every wrong answer. Each time they pushed the button, the actor on the other end would scream and beg for the subject to stop.
<br /><br />So, can you guess how this went?
<br /><br />The Result: Many subjects began to feel uncomfortable after a certain point, and questioned continuing the experiment. However, each time the guy in the lab coat encouraged them to continue. Most of them did, upping the voltage, delivering shock after shock while the victim screamed. Many subjects would laugh nervously, because laughter is the best medicine when pumping electrical currents through another person's body.
<br /><br />Eventually the actor would start banging on the wall that separated him from the subject, pleading about his heart condition. After further shocks, all sounds from victim's room would cease, indicating he was dead or unconscious. If you had to guess, what percentage of the subjects kept delivering shocks after that point?
<br /><br />Five percent? Ten?
<br /><br />Between 61 and 66 percent of subjects would continue the experiment until it reached the maximum voltage of 450, continuing to deliver shocks after the victim had been zapped into unconsciousness or the afterlife. Repeated studies have shown the same result: Subjects will mindlessly deliver pain to an innocent stranger as long as a dude in a lab coat says it's OK.
<br /><br />Most subjects wouldn't begin to object until after 300-volt shocks. Zero of them asked to stop the experiment before that point (keep in mind 100 volts is enough to kill a man, in some cases).
<br /><br />What This Says About You: You might like to think of yourself as a free-thinking marauder, but when it comes down to it, odds are you won't stick it to The Man because of the fear The Man will stick it right back up your ass. And this was just a guy in a lab coat--imagine if he'd had a uniform, or a badge.
<br /><br />Charles Sheridan and Richard King took this experiment one step further, but asked subjects to shock a puppy for every incorrect action it made. Unlike Milgram's experiment, this shock was real. Exactly 20 out of 26 subjects went to the highest voltage.
<br /><br />Almost 80 percent. Think about that when you're walking around the mall: Eight out of ten of those people you see would torture the shit out of a puppy if a dude in a lab coat asked them to[/b].[/b]<object width="336" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-2898955"></param><param name="wmode" value="window"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://en.pan.netcom/go/widget/videoID=en-2898955" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" wmode="window" width="336" height="295"></embed></object>
<br /><br /><strong>In the video above you can watch a modern reproduction of the experiment. All involved are “confederates”, except for the one person who is the unsuspecting subject.
<br /><br />Asked about a simple obvious question, everyone will give correct answers at first, but then will start to give unanimously wrong answers. Again and again.
<br /><br />Will the sole subject eventually give in and give the same, but wrong, answer as all the others?
<br /><br />As you can see, and hundreds of reproductions have confirmed, they eventually do, in an alarming proportion. More than one third of the times the subject gives in to the collective error, and up to three quarters of the subjects eventually gave in at some point.
<br /><br />No one was told to conform. There was nothing to gain or to lose. This is spontaneous social conformity.
<br /><br />“That we have found the tendency to conformity in our society so strong that reasonably intelligent and well-meaning young people are willing to call White Black is a matter of concern. It raises questions about our ways of education and about the values that guide our conduct”, wrote Asch.
<br /><br />Beyond its worrying main results, Asch’s Social Conformity Experiments are also enlightening in their details and variations.
<br /><br />If even one of the confederates gives a different answer, the conformity drops dramatically (from 5% to 10%). And this dissenting minority doesn’t even has to give the correct answer. It just has to manifest a different opinion.
<br /><br />There’s more. The conformity gets stronger when the confederates grow in number from one to three, unsurprisingly. But from three up to 10 to 15 confederates, the conformity don’t keep growing in a significant way. We would expect it to grow in linear form as the group gets bigger, but apparently things do not work that way.
<br /><br />We may also assume that those subjects who eventually gave the wrong answer knew they were wrong, and did so in a conscious manner so as to avoid conflict. But apparently, things do not work that way.
<br /><br />The subjects blamed their errors as their own fault, and even though they may not have been entirely sure of their choice, on the other hand they didn’t consider it clearly incorrect. Cognitive dissonance?
<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, a recent reproduction of the experiment using fMRI (a “brain scan”) suggests that social conformity does indeed alters the perception of reality. The areas of the brain activated during the crucial cases of conformity weren’t those high-level areas dealing with conflict and planning (“I know this is wrong, but I will give the same answer as everyone else”), but those more elementary dealing with perception (“oh well, that thing really looks like the other”).</strong>

<br />What is interesting about her story is that it is unlike anything we have read about a nine year old before. It brings insight into a world that many people disdain because they cannot relate to it. It is a far cry from the life of a perfect Disney or Nickelodeon child.  
<br />And here we have a young child telling chilling tales of things some could possibly not fathom. It’s a really deep journey of a young girl who must face daily challenges; challenges that her survival depends on. This is certainly quite the contrast from the girl we see walking down the red carpet in pretty dresses with a smile that could light the world on fire.
<br />In addition, another B-town baby tries her hand at writing. Shahrukh Khan's daughter, Suhana, is slated to release a fictional, four chapter children’s book in the near future.  A source reveals, “The novella she's written tells the story of a girl with six feet long eyelashes. When SRK asked her how it was possible for a girl to have such long lashes, she quickly replied back saying that the lashes were not real but just extensions.&quot; We can all see that young Suhana certainly gets her creativity from her talented dad.
<br />It looks like there is a bright future in the works for these two young girls, capitalizing on fame at a very young age.Tell us what you think about these child authors and their recent endeavors</strong>

		<document id="fb41563db3c66d92245dd971d37b9ff2" url=""><![CDATA[An imaginary Story written by 17 yrs BBA 1st Year student On<br/><br/><strong>The students from 1st year Bachelor of business administration were asked to write an imaginary story of self confidance/dedicasion in just 20 minutes, and one girl aged 17 years of age, was thinking what to write… she remembered her father, and God know what came in her mind and she wrote this story……..
<br /><br />One day a disheartened Businessman was seating in a park, very desperate, didn’t know what to do next, various vague ideas were coming in his mind, sometime he thought  of committing suicide, but then he started thinking of his family, as what they will do after his death, because non natural death don’t pay insurance, and no savings were left due to loss in business, house ornaments were sold, Villa was hypothecated to bank, the factories were locked by creditors, banks through court, he was totally confused, and at that time one old men in his 60’s comes and seats next to him, he seas this businessmen, and with enthusiasm he asks this men..
<br />Hello Gentlemen you look tensed, what is the problem?
<br />The business men looking at this old men says,
<br />Nothing Sir,  just like that.  The old men again looks at the businessmen and says, look son, my experience says that you have some problems, and it is said that if you tell your problems to some one you feel like telling, you may relax your mind and probably may even get a solution for your problems.
<br /><br />Now the businessmen thinks that the old men may be saying right, and I know I might relax my mind by telling him my story, may be the old men may not be of my any financial help, but I may get some advice from him, so the businessmen tells him his past and present..
<br /><br />Sir, my name is Mr.Rakesh Gupta, was so called CEO of &quot; Gupta Industries&quot;, Due to sudden crash in stock market and recession in the world market, I almost lost every thing,  you may say bankrupt , I asked time from Bankers, financers, and all other financial institutions, with whom I had borrowed money, but they refused,  giving a reason of recession .  After giving all my assets I had nothing to give more, I started getting warning calls from many financial institutions and other private financers, some in the midnight ,early mornings, there was a fear when they may call, some of the financers use to threaten with Dior consequences , they use to even call my wife, when I was not available, and my life became miserable.
<br /><br />All my so called friends, well wishers, relative, no one was ready to help me, no one even offered me food when my entire family did not eat food for three four days at a stretch, where I use to spend lavishly for parties on them, with liquor flowing like water,  I could not even get a glass of  water from them, so now I am into double mind as what to do? 
<br /><br />Feel like committing suicide, but I don’t want to die a coward’s death, I want to do some thing, but confused, so now you tell me what to do Sir?
<br /><br />The old men looked at Mr.Gupta and said, Mr. Gupta it is very sad what happened with you, but if you are, hardworking, ambitious, and believe in your self, think positive, take life as challenge, be sportive and think it this way, what happened in past was a bed dream, and try and achieve the next good dream, you have done it Gentlemen.
<br /><br />So Mr.Gupta I am Mr.Narsima Birla, no not any to do with Aditya Birla Group, but Chairmen of &quot; Narsima Group of Industries&quot; (Baed in Landon), which is a chain of Industries like Textile, Automobiles, Steel, energy power, N.B.Airlines, this air lines head office is in Landon, and it makes only Europe flights travels, so you must have not heard of that, also we are into fertilizers, with an annual company turnover of 5000 million dollars. That is my introduction, presently I have come to India on a vacation, my parents were from India, but I was born and bought up in Landon.  
<br /><br />When my father handed over this business to me it was only 550 million empire, and with my hard work, confidence, I brought this empire to 5000million,
<br /><br />So Mr.Gupta , let me offer you some thing, saying this Mr.Birla removed a cheque book from his coat and wrote one cheque for Five million Indinan Rupees, signed it and handed over to Mr.Gupta, and said,
<br /><br />Is this enough, or you want more? Don’t look at the cheque, as its from my personal account, and not form my company, now I shall meat you after one year at this same place, that time you may return my money back, and if you lose all this money even after putting hard work/dedication/self confidence, I won’t ask you for the money back.
<br /><br />So Mr.Gupta I shall see you after one year.
<br /><br />Mr.Gupta was just watching the cheque , he could not believe his eyes, and before he could say thanks,  Mr.Birla had disappeared.   Mr.Gupta pinched at himself, to see if he was not seaing a dream, or really a messenger of God had come to help him.
<br /><br />Mr.Gupta put the cheque in his pocket and came home, and he started thinking…..
<br /><br />Should I deposit this cheque? Yes.. No?
<br /><br />He thought, If I deposit it and if I fail to return?  Then I will not be able to face the old men, and he decided not to deposit it,  and just put in more efforts/dedication/hard work/ and work with confidence, probably he would be able to achieve his Goals.
<br /><br />He spoke this out to his wife.   And wife helped him even with the extent of geving her Mangalsutra , and told him..  &quot;when my husband is alive and ready to do any thing for his family, one chain for that matter can be taken care with one black thread round her neck&quot;.
<br /><br />With the little money Mr.Gupta gotby selling the same, he started a software developing company.
<br /><br />And it started picking up, he started getting orders from all over the world, and Mr.Gupta thought that probably the old men was helping unknowingly, Actually he was getting orders because of his work, quality of product, and user friendly software, so he started growing his business, the old creditors, banks which refused to give him lone, came to his door to help him, and very soon Gupta again became a business tycoon, he cleared all his earlier loans, he also bought a diamond studded Mangalsutra for his wife.  
<br /><br />But somewhere he was waiting for that day to come, to meat the old men, and one day morning Mr.Gupta’s electronic alarm clock gave a morning alarm at 5 in the morning &quot; Good Morning Gupta, you have to meat Mr.Birla today”
<br /><br />Gupta went to the same park at 5.30 in early morning, and was looking for the old men, and at sharp 7.23a.m the old men came to him, and says hello Gentlemen? Who are you? and what are you doing here in the morning?
<br /><br />Mr.Gupta said, don’t you remember me? You had given me a cheque for Five million Indian rupees, and I was to return to you today, so Sir here is your cheque. The old men sai.. But this is my own cheque, why are you giving it to me, and I don’t remember you, I am seeing you for the first time,
<br /><br />What? Gupta asked, and that time two nurses came the and said to Gupta, Sorry sir, hope this men has not disturbed you, then two ward boys came and took that old men with them, so Gupta asked the nurse, Is Mr.Birla not keeping well?
<br /><br />The nurse looked at Gupta and smilingly said, So,  Sir  has he given you any cheque?  This old men is a med patient, and is with us for last 15 yrs, every time he runs away from hospital, he introduces himself as Birla or some other name and issues chques of any amount,  you can see the mental hospital is just across that compound, and in the morning when we leave these patients for brushing , this old men always runs away and comes to this Garden. And  our Doctor, just to make this old men silent, printed a cheque  book and gave him to play in his room, he pays his hospital bill to doctor, give donations to other patients etc.. with these cheques, sir don’t deposit the cheque if he has issued you any.
<br /><br />Mr.Gupta realized one thing, that people may call this men mental, but for him he was a new rays towards success, because of him he could get his hidden self confidence, hard work and dedication , which helped him to get his lost empire, and then same evening he went and bought a building and named it as &quot;Mr.Narsimha Birla trust mental home&quot;, this was just next to the existing mental hospital, where the old men was treated, Then he also shifted the old men to this place,once it was ready. This hospital had all free facility for old mental people.
<br /><br />Mr.Gupta started a new chain of Industries named it &quot;N.Birla grope of industries&quot;.  He also built a small house with garden, nurses, , and all  facility for so called Birla next to the new hospital, he also maid a cabin with name board as CEO Mr.N.Birla, and printed a cheque book of 5 million slips with the name printed on it as, Mr.Narsima Birla, CEO, and handed it over to so called Birla.
<br /><br />The old men looked at the cheque book, with his name,  and smiled at Gupta, Gupta found the smile  more then 550 million rupees.
<br /><br />The girl student handed the story to the professor.
<br /><br />Professor went through the story again and again , and thought in his mind, that this may be an imagination, but it could be a lesson and inspration  for many youths around the world, and just when the class bell rings, and brought the end of the day for the student.</strong>

We were deeply in love. We were sitting in a fabulous restaurant after a magical evening listening to the Prague String Quartet. (Bach - my favourite.) We’d had a box (!) in the lavishly decorated Art Nouveau Opera House. The holiday was my Christmas present. By far and away the best Christmas present I’d ever had!
<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/83371105_11495935_23940824.jpg" />
<br /><br /><strong>He smiled. His deep blue eyes sought mine. Now was the moment - he was about to ask me, for sure.</strong>
<br />“Shall we get the bill?” he said.Oh, well, ok, perhaps a romantic walk in the moonlight would be better - more private. “God it’s cold out here - I can’t wait to get back to our lovely warm hotel…” It wasn’t far…
<br /><br />Well it was a lovely evening, but I had thought - had been sure - that he was going to ask me. He’d dropped so many hints, even trying a ring on my finger “…just to see if it fits…”
<br /><br /><strong>Mind you - I hadn’t decided for sure that I would say “Yes”. -</strong>
<br /> I loved him, (still do!) - I wanted to be with him, and I was definitely in it for the long haul, - but marriage? Been there, done that, got the crappy T shirt, the dish wash hands and the broken heart to prove it. All mended now, but it took a while.
<br /><br /><strong>And I had so enjoyed being single!</strong>
<br /> Watch E.R. on the telly. Eat cold spaghetti out of the tin (!). Natter on the phone til 2 in the morning and have a whole double bed all to myself! Was I ready to give up these delights for good?
<br /><br /><strong>Ok, I’m being flippant - but I do like my independence, </strong>and I’d hated the way that my first marriage seemed to end all that.
<br /> We’d turned into stereotypes overnight. Him: bullying husband. Me: nagging wife. But of course there was more to it than that, and I’d sorted through it all. Healed it, as best I could. Had time out. And then met this wonderful man. The man of my dreams. <strong>Except… did I want to get married again? I wasn’t sure. </strong>My doubts were about the institution. Not the man. There was nothing, and I mean: not one thing - even remotely similar between my previous relationship and this new love of my life. That much I knew.
<br /><br />On the plane, coming home from our wonderful holiday, I felt an unexpected pang of disappointment. My lovely man had thought of every detail. We’d had a blissful time. So why did I feel that something was missing? Actually… <strong>Why hadn’t he asked me to marry him?</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>I sat with the question for a while</strong>. I expect you’ve seen the answer already. Every time he’d dropped a hint or made a joke about getting married, I’d been non committal or downright negative. He’s sensitive, loving and wise. And he’s not stupid either! Why would he risk ruining a lovely holiday by asking me and maybe getting turned down? That would end up with both of us upset and awkward.
<br /><br /><strong>Suddenly, I knew what I wanted. I wanted him.</strong> Fully and completely. No holding back. Til death do us part, and all that. I had to let him know. But gently… Thoughtfully… When it happened naturally… at the right moment. I too, had to be patient.
<br /><br /><strong>After two weeks apart, we were together again. A cold, brisk walk on Dartmoor</strong>, along the river. I was grumbling about our long distance, back and forth, relationship. (Even though we probably spend more time together than most married couples.)
<br /><br />He leaned thoughtfully on the bridge: “Would it make a difference if we were married?” I looked straight at him. No jokes or snide remarks this time. “Do you mean it?<strong>” My voice wavered. “Are you asking me?”</strong>
<br /><br />“Well, I don’t know…” He was watching me, carefully. “What do you think?” As he put his arms around me, I knew what I thought, but thoughts and emotions are different animals and a whole herd of emotions seemed to be jostling for attention.<strong> “I think…” - there was no going back - my tears tumbled over a precipice - “</strong>…I would like to be married to you.” And since that day I have never been more certain of anything in my life.

With the Goan victim of the disease, the total number of those affected by Influenza A has gone up to 12.
<br /><br />The director of Health Services, Dr Rajnanda Dessai informed that a 41-year old man from South Goa who has been diagnosed of suffering from Influenza A (also known as swine flu) has been quarantined at the Chicalim Cottage Hospital and treated for the same as per the directive of central health agencies.
<br />In another case, a 35-year old woman who had flown from Sharjah was tested on Thursday for a possible case of Influenza A after she showed signs of flu. The woman was brought to the Goa Medical College for various tests and her blood samples were sent to NIV and NICD for test and the results would be known in a couple of days. The woman has since been told to remain indoors at her residence and not to come in contact with others till the test reports were received by the health officials.
<br /><br />According to information provided by health officials, the man had travelled to Brussels on June 2 and stayed in a hotel for half a day before leaving for London to catch a British Airways flight to Mumbai on June 3. He arrived in Goa from Mumbai by Jet Airways flight on June 4 and on June 6 he complained of headache, backache, fever, throat and other symptoms associated with Influenza A.
<br />The doctors said that the person was asymptomatic when he presented himself before the private doctors on June 8, where his blood samples were drawn for tests. The samples tested positive for influenza type A only and also indicated that it could be possible seasonal influenza as well.
<br />The additional samples were collected on June 10 and sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, and National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, for confirmation of the Novel H1N1 virus and tested positive for influenza type 'A' only, fitting the definition of a probable case of Influenza A (H1N1).
<br />Meanwhile, a second sample was taken as per the instruction of Dr Ravindran, director of EMR, New Delhi, and sent to NICD for official confirmation. The patient was also examined by a clinician to rule out any respiratory complication and quarantined in the isolation unit. The patient was since being treated with Oseltamivir capsule.
<br /><br />The state health officials have carried out the instructions of the central health agency and have begun identifying all possible contacts of the man found positive for Influenza A. The EMR director has told the state health officials that all contacts of the person, including flight passengers on the same row and three rows in front and back and all family members be given chemoprophylaxis with Oseltamivir capsule.
<br />The health officials have also been told to isolate the contacts if they develop flu-like symptoms and not to allow any person to contact the infected person except the medical and paramedical professionals. The GMC officials have also been told to be on lookout for influenza-like cases and take appropriate action in suspected cases.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the health officials on Thursday screened 219 foreign passengers for signs of Influenza A (H1N1) taking the total of foreign passengers screened so far to 6,675 since the directives were issued by the central health officials following outbreak of the disease. State health authorities and airport authorities are highly geared up to tackle the swine flu case detected in the state. A child and a mother have been referred to the Goa Medical College and Hospital at Bambolim for suspected swine flu while one person is undergoing treatment at the Chicalim Cottage Hospital in an isolated ward. The health officer, Cottage Hospital, Chicalim, Dr Suhas Gaitonde informed that the patient undergoing treatment in the isolated ward is a resident of Navelim, Margao.
<br /><br />Airport authorities in the state have raised concern over the attitude of the state health authorities for not providing any feedback to them on the cases detected at Dabolim airport. Highly placed sources informed that the airport authorities had requested the health authorities to provide them with feedback on suspected swine flu cases detected at the airport. The sources further informed that the airport authorities have already been alerted in view of the swine flu case detected in the state.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, as more swine flu cases were reported in the world including India, the World Health Organisation on Thursday declared the disease as a pandemic, raising its alert to maximum &quot;level six&quot;. A total of 74 countries are now affected by the virus. Swedish Health Minister, Ms Maria Larsson was to hold a press conference following 'the WHO's decision to raise the pandemic level to six for the influenza A(H1N1),= the Swedish government said in a statement.</strong>

<br /><strong>Washington, June 19  India has cautioned nations toying with protectionist measures in the wake of the global economic crisis that such a move would not only be counterproductive, but also deepen the recession and delay recovery.
<br /><br />'Any kind of protectionism will not only be counterproductive, but deepen the recession and delay the recovery,' Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told reporters Thursday at the end of his three-day visit for talks with the US officials.
<br /><br />'In our opinion, protectionism is counterproductive for any country, because protectionism at a time when we are talking of kickstarting the Doha development process would actually go against that spirit,' he said when asked about protectionist trends in the US.
<br /><br />Protectionism in any legal format would also subvert the multilateral processes and prolong the present economic recession and further delay any turnaround, he said.
<br /><br />All nations do eventually take action and policy measures to uphold supreme national interest, he said, but India is also committed to multilateralism. 'We are against protectionist measures.'</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>In the US, there was a lack of comprehension and information, particularly about the services sector which forms a major component of Indian exports, he said. 'What is perhaps not fully appreciated is that the outflow of services is evenly matched by the inflow of services.'
<br /><br />Noting that of the Fortune 500 companies, 100 have their research and development hubs in India and another 220 are sourcing their software from it, Sharma said: 'Do not forget, if India is such a huge IT industry, where does the hardware come from. That is why any protectionist barrier is dangerous.'
<br /><br />Referring to a report he released Wednesday, Sharma said the Indian industry brought in over $106 billion in economic activity to the US last year and created 300,000 jobs. Indian IT industry alone has created 250,000 jobs in America.
<br /><br />'It is reciprocity, which has to be acknowledged and appreciated,' he said.</strong>

<br /><br /><strong>Mumbai, June 20 (IANS) The intruder US-chartered Russian-make aircraft, AN-124-100, which was ordered to land in Mumbai late Friday after it violated Indian air space, was cleared by the intelligence and security agencies and given the green signal to leave Saturday afternoon, airport sources said.
<br /><br />The aircraft was to proceed on its journey around 4.30 p.m. Saturday, according to the sources.
<br /><br />On a flight from Diego Garcia, a US military base in the Indian Ocean, to Kandahar in Afghanistan, the aircraft chartered by the US Air Force had strayed into Indian airspace over Gujarat.
<br /><br />The civil cargo carrier was directed by the Mumbai Air Traffic Control (ATC) to change path and land at the airport here, which it complied with
<br /><br />Top civilian, intelligence and security agencies questioned the six crew-members of the aircraft.
<br /><br />However, the details of the outcome of the probe were kept under wraps. There is no indication whether the airspace violation was a genuine error on the part of the pilot or otherwise.
<br /><br />Since landing FRiday night around 10.45 p.m., the aircraft was stationed in the parking bay of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) amid high security.
<br /><br />It was provided all necessary ground services and reported to be carrying a cargo of military trucks and some arms and ammunition, though no official was willing to confirm.
<br /><br />The Indian Air Force (IAF) had detected the violation when the alien aircraft was seen flying over north-west Gujarat skies without appropriate clearances.
<br /><br />The Mumbai Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the IAF ordered it to divert to Mumbai and land here while the security set-up was put in high gear.
<br /><br />'Since the aircraft obeyed the ATC instructions and changed its path, there was no need for the IAF to be directly involved in the matter. Contrary to speculation, the IAF did not provide any escort to the aircraft which landed in Mumbai,' a defence ministry official told IANS.</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>Chartered plane forced to land after violating Indian airspace</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span>
<br /><strong>
<br />A chartered flight from Diego Garcia was Friday made to land at Mumbai by the Indian Air Force after it was found using a false call sign, an IAF official said here.
<br /><br />'All private planes are supposed to use a specific call sign. But this plane was using a call sign generally used by US military aircraft,' the official said.
<br /><br />'Due to this, we realised that it did not have a valid air defence clearance to fly over India,' the official added.
<br /><br />'Following this, IAF aircraft escorted the chartered flight to Mumbai.'</strong>

Journalists covering the protests reported that the Iranian pro-government Basij militia wasn't acting lightly on the protests and on numerous occassions used force to disperse the crowds. The protests come on the 10th anniversary of a student uprising that posed an unheralded threat to the Islamic regime. Reports have the number of protesters around 3,000 located not to far away from the University. Men and women chanted Mir Hossein Moussavi name, the opposition who was not elected as well as other religious phrases. Journalists say that students had tear gas thrown at them along with beatings from batons that officers carried. Government officials made it clear before these protests took place that if anyone demonstrated their disgust, they would be met with strong and swift forces since no demonstration permits were issued to the people protesting the election results. It is amazing how a government will make and bend rules to sure that their authority is not challenged by the people who supposedly put them in office. It makes me proud to have freedoms that are so often taken for granted. I praise and admire the students and people who defied government warning to fight for their beliefs. Whether they know it or not they are making an impact and a difference; I guarantee the government is hearing their voices and cries for changes, now if only something would be done by a brave and courageous soul inside the government office.</strong>
