<br />&quot;Mom and Dad, I'm coming home, but I've a favor to ask. I have a friend I'd like to bring home with me.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Sure,&quot; they replied, &quot;we'd love to meet him.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;There's something you should know the son continued, &quot;he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting. He stepped on a land mind and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to come live with us.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Son,&quot; said the father, &quot;you don't know what you're asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something
<br />like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own.&quot;
<br /><br />At that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing more from him. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police believed it was suicide. The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had only one arm and one leg.
<br /><br />The parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don't like people who inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away
<br />from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are. Thankfully, there's someone who won't treat us that way. Someone who loves us with an unconditional love that welcomes us into the forever family, regardless of how messed up we are.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />A woman was out golfing one day when she hit the ball into the woods.
<br /><br />She went into the woods to look for it and found a frog in a trap. The
<br />frog told her, &quot;If you release me from this trap, I will grant you
<br />three wishes.&quot;
<br /><br />The woman freed the frog, and the frog said, &quot;Thank you, but I failed
<br />to mention that there was a condition to your wishes. Whatever you wish
<br />for, your husband will get it ten times!&quot;
<br /><br />The woman said, &quot;That's okay.&quot;
<br /><br />For her first wish, she wanted to be the most beautiful woman in the
<br />world. The frog warned her, &quot;You do realize that this wish will also make
<br />your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis whom women
<br />will flock to&quot;. The woman replied, &quot;That's okay, because I will be the
<br />most beautiful woman and he will have eyes only for me.&quot;
<br /><br />So, KAZAM-she's the most beautiful Woman in the world!
<br /><br />For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world.
<br />The frog said, &quot;That
<br /><br />will make your husband the richest man in the world. And he will be ten
<br />times richer than you. &quot; The woman said, &quot;That's okay, because what's
<br />mine is his and what's his is mine.&quot;
<br /><br />So, KAZAM-she's the richest woman in the world!
<br /><br />The frog then inquired about her third wish, and she answered, &quot;I'd
<br />like a mild heart attack!&quot;
<br /><br />Moral of the story: Women are clever. Don't mess with them!
<br /><br />Attention female readers: This is the end of the joke for you. Stop
<br />here and continue feeling good!
<br /><br />Male readers: Please scroll down.
<br /><br />The man had a heart attack ten times milder than his wife!!!
<br /><br />Moral of the story: Women are really dumb but think they're really
<br />smart!
<br /><br />Let them continue to think that way and just enjoy the show!
<br /><br />PS: If you are a woman and are still reading this; it only goes to show
<br />that women never listen!!!

<br /><br />Why Lawyers should never ask a witness a question if they aren't
<br />prepared for the answer...
<br /><br />In a trial, a Southern small town prosecuting attorney called his first
<br />witness to the stand. The witness was a grand motherly, elderly woman.
<br />He approached her and asked, &quot;Mrs. Jones, do you know me?&quot;
<br /><br />She responded, &quot;Why, yes I do know you, Mr. Williams. I've known you
<br />since you were a young boy, and frankly, you've been a big
<br />disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate
<br />people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big
<br />shot when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to
<br />anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you. &quot; The Lawyer
<br />was stunned.
<br /><br />Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, &quot;Mrs.
<br />Jones, do you know the defense attorney?&quot; She again replied, &quot;Why yes, I
<br />do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. He's lazy,
<br />bigoted and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal
<br />relationship with
<br />anyone and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not
<br />to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women, one of
<br />them was your wife. Yes, I know him.&quot; The defense attorney almost died.
<br /><br />The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench, and in a very
<br />quiet voice, said, &quot;If either of you bastards asks her, if she knows me,
<br />I'll throw you in jail for contempt.&quot; <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />__/                                    __/
<br /><br />Little Bobby came into the kitchen where his mother was making dinner.
<br /><br />His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good time to tell
<br />his_ mother what he wanted.
<br /><br />&quot;Mom, I want a bike for my birthday.&quot; Little Bobby was a bit of a troublemaker.
<br /><br />He had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Bobby's mother asked
<br />him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday.
<br />Little Bobby, of course, thought he did.
<br /><br />Bobby's mother wanted Bobby to reflect on his behaviour over the last
<br />year.
<br /><br />&quot;Go to your room, Bobby, and think about how you have behaved this year.
<br /><br />Then write a letter to God and tell him why you deserve a bike for your
<br /><br />birthday.&quot; Little Bobby stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to
<br /><br />write God a letter.
<br /><br />*/*/Letter 1/*/*/
<br /><br />//Dear God,
<br /><br />//I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my
<br /><br />//birthday. I want a red one.
<br /><br />//Your friend,
<br /><br />//Bobby///**
<br /><br />Bobby knew that this wasn't true. He had not been a very good boy this
<br />year,
<br /><br />so he tore up the letter and started over.
<br /><br />*/*/Letter 2/*/*/
<br /><br />//Dear God,
<br /><br />//This is your friend Bobby. I have been a good boy this year and I
<br /><br />would like
<br /><br />//a red bike for my birthday.
<br /><br />//Thank you.
<br /><br />//Your friend Bobby//
<br /><br />/**
<br /><br />Bobby knew that this wasn't true either. So, he tore up the letter and
<br /><br />started again.
<br /><br />*/*/Letter 3/*/*/
<br /><br />//Dear God,
<br /><br />//I have been an &quot;OK &quot;boy this year. I still would really like a bike
<br /><br />for my birthday.
<br /><br />//Bobby//
<br /><br />/**
<br /><br />Bobby knew he could not send this letter to God either. So, Bobby wrote
<br />a
<br /><br />fourth letter.
<br /><br />*/*/Letter 4/*/*/
<br /><br />//God,
<br /><br />//I know I haven't been a good boy this year. I am very sorry. I will be
<br /><br />//a good boy if you just send me a bike for my birthday. Please!
<br /><br />//Thank you,
<br /><br />//Bobby//
<br /><br />/**
<br /><br />Bobby knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him a
<br /><br />bike.
<br /><br />Now, Bobby was very upset. He went downstairs and told his mom that he
<br /><br />wanted to go to church. Bobby's mother thought her plan had worked, as
<br />Bobby
<br /><br />looked very sad.
<br /><br />&quot;Just be home in time for dinner,&quot; Bobby's mother told him.
<br /><br />Bobby walked down the street to the church on the corner. Little Bobby
<br />went
<br /><br />into the church and up to the altar. He looked around to see if anyone
<br />was
<br /><br />there. Bobby bent down and picked up a statue of the Mary. He slipped
<br /><br />the statue under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street,
<br />into
<br /><br />the house, and up to his room. He shut the door to his room and sat down
<br /><br />with a piece of paper and a pen. Bobby began to write his letter to God.   
<br /><br />*/*/Letter 5/*/*/
<br /><br />//God,
<br /><br />//I'VE KIDNAPPED YOUR MAMA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, //
<br /><br />//SEND THE BIKE! !!!!!!!!!//

<br />while he logged on the website with his registration no.
<br /><br />&quot; Ma&quot; , he screamed in excitement,&quot; I scored 1191, with centum in 4
<br />subjects. I cant believe it. &quot;
<br /><br />I kinda became numb in my excitement. My eyes became wet.
<br /><br />I kissed him on his forehead and smiled. My husband had gone out of
<br />station on some business trip and my son immediately called him on his cell
<br />and told him of the news.
<br /><br />Soon we realized that he stood first in the state. Oh, my joy knew no bounds
<br />when Reporters and media persons soon swamped my house for interviews and
<br />photos. I was so honored to join him in the snaps.
<br /><br />I wanted to call my &quot;wrong-number-friend to tell him the news......I was so
<br />excited.
<br /><br />He was someone whom I have known for more than 20 years.
<br /><br />I still do not remember when we became friends, but certainly cannot forget
<br />the first day he called me when I blasted him for giving me so many wrong
<br />calls.....after that he had called up a week later asking apology, for he
<br />had now got the right no of his friend whom he wanted to talk to .We spoke
<br />for an hour that day...even without knowing each other's names. Though he
<br />kept pestering me to reveal my name I never did and so he kept a
<br />name...Sweety. I used to get so shy whenever he called me 'Sweety'. I was
<br />doing first year of BSc. Maths then, and he was a Computer Engineering
<br />student.
<br /><br />From then he used to call me very often. We almost discussed everything..
<br />By the final year of my college, we probably we were in love, but I had been
<br />cautious. I was in a dilemma whether to tell him. But what if he was of a
<br />different religion? Do I have the courage to talk to my parents about it?
<br /><br />.........all these questions ran through my mind.
<br /><br />I decided I'll not talk to him thereafter. When he called next time I told a lie to him I that I was going to Karachi for my studies.
<br /><br />He gave me his office number and asked me to ring him up once I reach there.
<br /><br />I never called.......
<br /><br />A couple of months later my marriage got fixed with a guy of my parent's
<br />choice. I was not happy but I did not complain; rather accepted it as an
<br />obedient daughter. At times I felt I missed my wrong- number- friend.......
<br /><br />My hubby was a moody person; I have hardly spent any good time with him- but
<br />he was genuine indeed and never bothered my personal space. After 2 years we
<br />had a boy...Yet, I was not very happy with my married life...One day I
<br />happened to browse through my diary and found I still had my old friend's
<br />office phone no that he had given me. I dialed it and spoke with him.
<br /><br />He said he was married and got a kid too. I was happy for him though in the
<br />bottom of the heart I felt bad that I could not marry him.
<br /><br />From then I used to occasionally call him on that number. I never gave him
<br />mine as I felt that would put me in trouble...
<br /><br />And till today I almost shared everything with him including my relationship
<br />with my hubby.....today I was so happy and I wanted to call him.
<br /><br />Just then I got a call.
<br />&quot;Your husband met with an accident and died on the spot&quot;
<br /><br />I banged the phone down. I broke. I did not call my friend.....I somehow
<br />started feeling guilty. I have never tried to talk to him properly when he
<br />was alive or moved close with him....
<br /><br />I felt I had been a bad wife........
<br /><br />A couple of years passed and one day my son brought home a Bengali girl and
<br />said they wanted to get married. I got them married as I did not want my son
<br />to go through what I did.
<br /><br />I decided to give my son his father's room and started clearing it. There
<br />was a phone book. I gently opened it to find, &quot; Wrong No: Sweety -XXXX XXXX&quot;

<br />&gt;&gt;Dear Husband
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for
<br />&gt;&gt;good.
<br />&gt;&gt;I've
<br />&gt;&gt;been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show
<br />&gt;&gt;for
<br />&gt;&gt;it.
<br />&gt;&gt;These last two weeks have been hell.
<br />Your boss called to tell me
<br />&gt;&gt;that
<br />&gt;&gt;you
<br />&gt;&gt;had quit your job today and that was the last straw. Last week, you
<br />&gt;&gt;came
<br />&gt;&gt;home and didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done,
<br />&gt;&gt;cooked
<br />&gt;&gt;your
<br />&gt;&gt;favorite meal and even wore a brand new negligee. You came home and
<br />&gt;&gt;ate
<br />&gt;&gt;in
<br />&gt;&gt;two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game.
<br />&gt;&gt;You
<br />&gt;&gt;don't
<br />&gt;&gt;tell me you love me anymore, you don't touch me or anything Either
<br />&gt;&gt;you're
<br />&gt;&gt;cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm
<br />&gt;&gt;gone.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;P.S. If you're trying to find me, don't. Your BROTHER and I are
<br />&gt;&gt;moving
<br />&gt;&gt;away
<br />&gt;&gt;to West Virginia together! Have a great life!
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;You're
<br />Ex-wife
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;***********************
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;Dear Ex-Wife
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter. It's true
<br />&gt;&gt;that
<br />&gt;&gt;you
<br />&gt;&gt;and I have been married for seven years, although a good woman is a
<br />&gt;&gt;far
<br />&gt;&gt;cry
<br />&gt;&gt;from what you've been. I watch sports so much to try to drown out
<br />&gt;&gt;your constant nagging. Too bad that doesn't work. I did notice when
<br />&gt;&gt;you
<br />&gt;&gt;cut
<br />&gt;&gt;off all of your hair last week, the first thing that came to mind
<br />&gt;&gt;was
<br />&gt;&gt;&quot;You
<br />&gt;&gt;look just like a man!&quot; My mother raised me to not say anything if
<br />&gt;&gt;you can't say anything nice. When you cooked my favorite meal, you
<br />&gt;&gt;must
<br />&gt;&gt;have
<br />&gt;&gt;gotten me confused with MY BROTHER, because I stopped eating pork
<br /><br />&gt;&gt;seven
<br />&gt;&gt;years ago. I went to sleep on you when you had on that new negligee
<br />&gt;&gt;because
<br />&gt;&gt;the price tag was still on it. I prayed that it was a coincidence
<br />&gt;&gt;that
<br />&gt;&gt;my
<br />&gt;&gt;brother had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning and
<br />&gt;&gt;your
<br />&gt;&gt;negligee was $49.99. After all of this, I still loved you and felt
<br />&gt;&gt;that
<br />&gt;&gt;we
<br />&gt;&gt;could work it out. So when I discovered that I had hit the lotto
<br />&gt;&gt;for ten
<br />&gt;&gt;million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica
<br />&gt;&gt;.
<br />&gt;&gt;But
<br />&gt;&gt;when I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason I
<br />&gt;&gt;guess.
<br />&gt;&gt;I
<br />&gt;&gt;hope you have the filling life you always wanted. My lawyer said
<br />&gt;&gt;with
<br />&gt;&gt;your
<br />&gt;&gt;letter that you wrote, you won't get a
<br />dime from me. So take care.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />&gt;&gt;P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this but Carl, my brother was
<br />&gt;&gt;born
<br />&gt;&gt;Carla. I hope that's not a problem. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />ARIES                         MARCH 21 - APRIL 20
<br />Nothing seems to ruffle you more than a lack of discipline, disloyalty and decorum.  But Arians are also known to go into a rage very easily when
<br />challenged.  Those of you who have been on the receiving end of the Aries temper know that if not calmed down they can even get violent.  But one
<br />thing is certain if the opponent remains calm and does not
<br />react to their outburst, Arians cool down very fast.  They are also the first to apologise,
<br />which makes them easier to forgive.
<br /><br />TAURUS                      APRIL 21 - MAY 20
<br /><br />You are generally quiet and have control over your emotions.  It is difficult to predict what will upset you, so when you do lose your cool, people
<br />don't know how to react.  Your temper is like that of a raging bull, and anyone trying to pacify you will be the first one to get a verbal bashing.
<br />You generally get upset when you are concerned or when people accuse you of doing something wrong.  You also hate being reminded about mistakes you've
<br />made in the past.  You also have the potential to be
<br />terribly vindictive if rubbed the wrong way.
<br /><br />GEMINI                       MAY 21 - June 20
<br /><br />You are recognised by your cheerful disposition and your jovial nature is easily susceptible to anger.  In fact, you are the best person to have
<br />around when there is an ugly scene at a party you can bring the warring factions together quite diplomatically.  But when you lose cool, you yell and
<br />scream and will not listen to reason.  You must have the last word in a wordy duel.  Your capacity to argue aggressively is matched only by your
<br />seductive charm.
<br /><br />CANCER                  JUNE 21 - JULY 21
<br /><br />Considering how charming, caring and kind you are, you dislike unpleasant scenes, much less creating one yourself.  You have great tolerance and
<br />rarely get provoked into losing your temper.  If someone is unreasonable or trying to create trouble, you are more likely to walk away quietly.  But
<br />that does not mean you do not have a temper.  When angry, in your effort to control your emotions, you tremble, your hands get sweaty and sometimes
<br />you fumble for words.  Tears roll down your eyes easily and the opponent is touched by your innocence and will seek an apology immediately.
<br /><br />LEO                             JULY 22 - AUGUST 21
<br /><br />If anyone has total control over their emotions, it is you.  But then, you can be described as stiff, cold and uncaring.  You are known to lack
<br />spontaneity but you really don't care about opinions.  You don't like to create scenes and will never accept invitations to a party where you suspect
<br />the presence of an unruly lot.  But your very presence seems challenging to some and they take vicarious pleasure in your disquiet. When angry you can
<br />use critical language.  A dressingdown can humiliate your opponent, causing a strain between both of you forever.
<br /><br />VIRGO                         AUGUST 22 - SEPTEMBER 21
<br /><br />Most of you are gentle and have full control over your emotions but
<br />those of you given to temper tantrums can certainly get violent. When see things
<br />with rage, you yell and shout and tend to break things lying close at hand.  You can even harm yourself by banging your hands on a glass top table or
<br />wall.  You should never get into any argument, for you are a sore loser.  You feel that others are trying to persecute you and don't quite respect
<br />your opinions.  When hurt, you can also hold grudges forever.
<br /><br />LIBRA                       SEPTEMBER 22 - OCTOBER 22
<br /><br />Did someone say that you are the charmers of the zodiac?  Well, it's true. Few have ever seen you ruffled or angry.  You are very conscious of your image, and
<br />you believe that anger distorts your face and personality.  You also think you are above things like anger.  But wait before you get into
<br />self-congratulatory mood.  Your family or those very close to you know you better.  You have an unmatched temper amongst all the zodiac signs, and
<br />what makes it worse is your capacity to justify it.
<br /><br />SCORPIO                    OCTOBER 23 - NOVEMBER 21
<br /><br />Of course you don't lose your cool.  But your very demeanour (manner) projects hauhtiness (arrogance, pride), pride and grand disdain (disregard) for
<br />lesser mortals (human).  Others are often found saying that anger sits on your nose and you are raring to give your piece mind to the first person who try to be funny with you.  You are selective in the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance for the superflous (extra) types. Your
<br />tongue-lashing (attack) is generally in a soft hissing tone for when you scream, your voice tends to get shrill and loud and you do hate drawing
<br />attention to yourself!  When upset, you are angrier with yourself for having shown we a! kness, for the last thing that Scorpio wants to show is being
<br />out of control.
<br /><br />SAGITTARIUS                NOVEMBER 22 - DECEMBER 20
<br /><br />You are insensible and generally have no complete control over your emotions.  You do get angry quickly and others marvel at your anger levels even when provoked.  Actually, you get tongue-tied when angry and you will remove your anger waiting for the other person to calm down.  Then you will
<br />reason with your opponent and convince the other person in a very gentle manner that the whole thing was just his mistake.  You're also likely to totally sever ties with someone when you're upset with them.
<br /><br />CAPRICORN               DECEMBER 21 - JANUARY 19
<br /><br />Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like you is capable of sensitivity and genuine emotions.  You project a hard
<br />exterior but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide from others.  You can see thing with anger but will not betray your feelings.
<br />But then, there are times that even you cannot control your temper.
<br />Under such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with frustration at the
<br />situation than with anger at any particular person. Your outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.
<br /><br />AQUARIUS                  JANUARY 20 - FEBRUARY 18
<br /><br />You are noble and kind and dislike losing control over yur emotions.  It is very rare for you to get angry.  You are also the pacifier in situations
<br />that involve arguments.  It is always your endeavour to be perfect and socially correct in your behaviour and attitude, but if misunderstood and
<br />slighted you can give in to an angry outburst.  You will shout and scream and then walk out from the scene.  You cannot easily forget the situation
<br />and will be bitter about it for a long time.
<br /><br />PISCES                       FEBRUARY 19 - MARCH 20
<br /><br />The only thing that can be said about you dreamers is that you appear even more attractive when angry.  You are very sensitive to others' feelings, so
<br />you rarely hurt them.  But when others tend to hurt you, then things take a nasty turn.  You will yell and use harsh words and feel inclined to shake everything and everyone up.  Your creative imagination is at its best when angry, and you tend to get pretty dramatic.  When upset, you refuse to
<br />listen to reason and wish to be left alone.  But once you calm down, you repent your tantrums and seek forgiveness.  SO nobody can be ups e! t with you for too long.

If we see you wearing Prada shoes and carrying a Gucci bag, we assume you are doing well financially and therefore do not need a raise. If you dress poorly, you need to learn to manage your money better, so that you buy nicer clothes, and therefore you do not need a raise. If you dress just right, you are right where you need to be and therefore you do not need a raise.
<br /><br />Sick Days
<br />We will no longer accept a doctors statement as proof of sickness. If you are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come to work.
<br /><br />Annual Leave Days
<br />Each employee will receive 104 Annual Leave days a year. They are called Saturday &amp; Sunday.
<br /><br />Bereavement Leave
<br />This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing you can do for dead friends, relatives or co-workers. Every effort should be made to have non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare cases where employee involvement is necessary, the funeral should be scheduled in the late afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work through your lunch hour and subsequently leave one hour early.
<br /><br />Toilet Use
<br />Entirely too much time is being spent in the toilet. There is now a strict three-minute time limit in the stalls. At the end of three minutes, an alarm will sound, the toilet paper roll will retract, the stall door will open, and a picture will be taken. After your second offence, your picture will be posted on the company bulletin board under the Chronic offenders category. Anyone caught smiling in the picture will be sanctioned under the company&amp;#8217;s mental health policy.
<br /><br />Lunch Break
<br />Skinny people get 30 minutes for lunch, as they need to eat more, so that they can look healthy. Normal size people get 15 minutes for lunch to get a balanced meal to maintain their average figure. Chubby people get 5 minutes for lunch, because that&amp;#8217;s all the time needed to drink a Slim-Fast.
<br /><br />Thank you for your loyalty to our company. We are here to provide a positive employment experience. Therefore, all questions, comments, concerns, complaints, frustrations, irritations, aggravations, insinuations, allegations, accusations, contemplation&amp;#8217;s, consternation and input should be directed elsewhere.

<br />Lord,  I would like to know what Heaven and Hell are like.
<br />The Lord led the holy man to two doors. He opened one of the doors and
<br />the  holy man looked in. In  the middle of the room was a large round
<br />table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew which
<br />smelled delicious and  made the holy man's mouth water. The people
<br />sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They  appeared to be
<br />famished. They were holding spoons with very long handles and  each
<br />found it possible to reach into the pot of stew  and take a spoonful,
<br />but because the handle was longer than their arms,  they could not get
<br />the  spoons back into their mouths. The holy man  shuddered at the
<br />sight of their  misery and suffering. The Lord said, &quot;You have seen
<br />Hell.&quot;
<br />They went to the next room and opened the door. It  was exactly the
<br />same as  the first one. There was the large round table with  the
<br />large pot of stew  which made the holy man's mouth water. The people
<br />were equipped with the same long-handled spoons, but here the people
<br />were
<br />well nourished and plump,  laughing and talking. The holy man said, &quot;I
<br />don't  understand&quot;.&quot; It is simple  said the Lord, &quot;it requires but one
<br />skill. You see, they have learned to feed each other. While the greedy
<br />think only of  themselves.&quot;
<br /><br />Moral:  Its people's attitude that makes our place of work, a hell or
<br />heaven to  them!!  'Help and Seek Help'  this makes all the
<br />difference to each individual's life...and makes our lives hell or
<br />otherwise.
<br />Success and happiness is all  about effective team-work.....make it a
<br />great week  ahead!!!.

<br />while he logged on the website with his registration no.
<br /><br />&quot; Ma&quot; , he screamed in excitement,&quot; I scored 1191, with centum in 4
<br />subjects. I cant believe it. &quot;
<br /><br />I kinda became numb in my excitement. My eyes became wet.
<br /><br />I kissed him on his forehead and smiled. My husband had gone out of
<br />station on some business trip and my son immediately called him on his cell
<br />and told him of the news.
<br /><br />Soon we realized that he stood first in the state. Oh, my joy knew no bounds
<br />when Reporters and media persons soon swamped my house for interviews and
<br />photos. I was so honored to join him in the snaps.
<br /><br />I wanted to call my &quot;wrong-number-friend to tell him the news......I was so
<br />excited.
<br /><br />He was someone whom I have known for more than 20 years.
<br /><br />I still do not remember when we became friends, but certainly cannot forget
<br />the first day he called me when I blasted him for giving me so many wrong
<br />calls.....after that he had called up a week later asking apology, for he
<br />had now got the right no of his friend whom he wanted to talk to .We spoke
<br />for an hour that day...even without knowing each other's names. Though he
<br />kept pestering me to reveal my name I never did and so he kept a
<br />name...Sweety. I used to get so shy whenever he called me 'Sweety'. I was
<br />doing first year of BSc. Maths then, and he was a Computer Engineering
<br />student.
<br /><br />From then he used to call me very often. We almost discussed everything..
<br />By the final year of my college, we probably we were in love, but I had been
<br />cautious. I was in a dilemma whether to tell him. But what if he was of a
<br />different religion? Do I have the courage to talk to my parents about it?
<br /><br />.........all these questions ran through my mind.
<br /><br />I decided I'll not talk to him thereafter. When he called next time I told a lie to him I that I was going to Karachi for my studies.
<br /><br />He gave me his office number and asked me to ring him up once I reach there.
<br /><br />I never called.......
<br /><br />A couple of months later my marriage got fixed with a guy of my parent's
<br />choice. I was not happy but I did not complain; rather accepted it as an
<br />obedient daughter. At times I felt I missed my wrong- number- friend.......
<br /><br />My hubby was a moody person; I have hardly spent any good time with him- but
<br />he was genuine indeed and never bothered my personal space. After 2 years we
<br />had a boy...Yet, I was not very happy with my married life...One day I
<br />happened to browse through my diary and found I still had my old friend's
<br />office phone no that he had given me. I dialed it and spoke with him.
<br /><br />He said he was married and got a kid too. I was happy for him though in the
<br />bottom of the heart I felt bad that I could not marry him.
<br /><br />From then I used to occasionally call him on that number. I never gave him
<br />mine as I felt that would put me in trouble...
<br /><br />And till today I almost shared everything with him including my relationship
<br />with my hubby.....today I was so happy and I wanted to call him.
<br /><br />Just then I got a call.
<br />&quot;Your husband met with an accident and died on the spot&quot;
<br /><br />I banged the phone down. I broke. I did not call my friend.....I somehow
<br />started feeling guilty. I have never tried to talk to him properly when he
<br />was alive or moved close with him....
<br /><br />I felt I had been a bad wife........
<br /><br />A couple of years passed and one day my son brought home a Bengali girl and
<br />said they wanted to get married. I got them married as I did not want my son
<br />to go through what I did.
<br /><br />I decided to give my son his father's room and started clearing it. There
<br />was a phone book. I gently opened it to find, &quot; Wrong No: Sweety -XXXX XXXX&quot;
