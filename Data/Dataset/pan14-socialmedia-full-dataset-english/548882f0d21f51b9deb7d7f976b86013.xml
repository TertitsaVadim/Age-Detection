This ACSM certified course is designed for people who are already working as personal trainers, and it is focused on helping you enhance your coaching and client management skills. <br /><br />What You Can Gain<br /><br />You can gain a number of things from the Fitness Coach course. First, you will gain improved coaching skills. Second, you will gain improved client management skills. Third, you will gain access to a client management system. <br /><br />Good coaching skills help you to retain your clients. Many people come to a personal trainer because they have specific goals in mind. Some people want to lose weight, some people want to get in shape, and some people want to do something better. For example, someone might decide to work with a personal trainer because he wants to be able run a mile in under six or seven minutes. <br /><br />Your first job is to be the personal trainer and to help your clients achieve these goals. However, in the interest of your business and your clients’ continued wellbeing, you want them to continue to work with you even after they have achieved their initial goals. For this to occur, you need to have good goal setting skills, good motivation skills, and good coaching skills. You have to make the transition from personal trainer (who is helping someone with something that they cannot do by themselves) to coach (who is there to challenge and encourage someone who has the physical skills). <br /><br />In terms of client management, you learn how to keep your clients’ information organised through the use of a client management system. This system helps you keep up with your client’s details, such as birthdays, their progress, and your appointments. It also helps you to keep track of your prospective clients. <br /><br />How the Course Works <br /><br />The Fitness Coach course has two distinct parts. First, you will work with the Virtual Library. This is an online portal where you will find both written and recorded information. You will have to time to look through this information before the e-classes begin. <br /><br />E-classes are online classes that you will take with other students. You will need internet access and a headset to be able to participate, and the classes will focus on topics such as coaching, client management, your client management system, and business. For example, you will learn about new business plans that can better incorporate your new skills and your client management system. Once the course is complete, you will still have access to your client management system, and you will be able to use it as part of your day to day business. <br /><br />Taking the Fitness Coach course is easy, as it is all online, and you will benefit from taking this course. The European Institute of Fitness is an organisation with a great deal of experience, and you should contact them today about enrolling in the Fitness Coach course. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vdXJzdGFnZS5jb20vcHJvZmlsZS9jYXJjY3dwcm9pdHkvYmxvZy8x" target="_blank">Expand Your Business with Fitness Coach</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL2VoQ2xhenl1ZGVqYU1hZ2dpby9ibG9nLzE4NTAyOA__" target="_blank">Expand Your Business with Fitness Coach</a>

This ACSM certified course is designed for people who are already working as personal trainers, and it is focused on helping you enhance your coaching and client management skills. <br /><br />What You Can Gain<br /><br />You can gain a number of things from the Fitness Coach course. First, you will gain improved coaching skills. Second, you will gain improved client management skills. Third, you will gain access to a client management system. <br /><br />Good coaching skills help you to retain your clients. Many people come to a personal trainer because they have specific goals in mind. Some people want to lose weight, some people want to get in shape, and some people want to do something better. For example, someone might decide to work with a personal trainer because he wants to be able run a mile in under six or seven minutes. <br /><br />Your first job is to be the personal trainer and to help your clients achieve these goals. However, in the interest of your business and your clients’ continued wellbeing, you want them to continue to work with you even after they have achieved their initial goals. For this to occur, you need to have good goal setting skills, good motivation skills, and good coaching skills. You have to make the transition from personal trainer (who is helping someone with something that they cannot do by themselves) to coach (who is there to challenge and encourage someone who has the physical skills). <br /><br />In terms of client management, you learn how to keep your clients’ information organised through the use of a client management system. This system helps you keep up with your client’s details, such as birthdays, their progress, and your appointments. It also helps you to keep track of your prospective clients. <br /><br />How the Course Works <br /><br />The Fitness Coach course has two distinct parts. First, you will work with the Virtual Library. This is an online portal where you will find both written and recorded information. You will have to time to look through this information before the e-classes begin. <br /><br />E-classes are online classes that you will take with other students.
