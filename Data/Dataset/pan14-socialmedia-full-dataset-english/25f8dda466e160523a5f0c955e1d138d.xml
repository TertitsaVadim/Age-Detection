Over the past decade, Wal-Mart has become an extremely powerful global leader in the retail sector by providing consumers with goods at everyday low prices. To achieve this, they developed a strategy that centers on replenishing their inventory efficiently while striving to lower costs through cross docking. The cross docking technique allowed Wal-Mart to reduce handling, operating, and storage costs to allow for everyday low prices. Wal-Mart’s commitment to a sustainable supply chain management strategy by providing consumers what they want and when they want it contributed to their low cost leadership strategy—the global retail giant’s competitive advantage over rivals.

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Logistics software</strong></a> refers to the management of material flow in an organization from the point of origin to the point of destination. Logistics is the combination of information, transportation, warehousing, inventory, material handling, packaging, and often, security in a business organization. Supply chain is dynamic and it refers to the constant flow of information, goods, and capital from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Supply chain management (SCM) is the management of the network of information, materials, and finances as it flows from supplier to manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer, and then finally to the consumer. SCM aims to reduce inventory while assuring the goods are immediately available when needed.
<br /><br />Logistics and supply chain management software have evolved over the years, giving businesses plenty of reasons to take advantage of them. Logistics software has allowed organizations to automate the management of transportation related data for analysis. Businesses can then make more informed decisions, like how to get products out faster to the public, based on that analysis. Supply chain management software (SCMS) includes a wide array of software tools used in management and execution of supply chain functions and business processes. The goal of installing supply chain management software is to ultimately, apply just-in-time manufacturing. By gathering accurate supply chain information, businesses can apply just-in-time manufacturing—an inventory strategy in which materials purchased and produced only needed to meet actual consumer demand. This will allow companies to reduce the amount of in-process inventory they keep, allowing the business to lower storage costs.
<br /><br />Today, in order for corporations and businesses to efficiently and effectively manage inventory and material handling, strategic logistics and supply chain management solutions must be utilized. Because logistics can be extremely complex and constantly changing, software has been developed as tool for modeling and analyzing. Companies can look to logistics software to better optimize production logistics. Furthermore, there is a plethora of effective supply chain management software for businesses to take advantage of. Not sure which one to purchase? Product reviews and other resources for logistics or supply chain management software can be found online. By setting up efficient logistics and supply chain procedures, you can better predict and meet customer expectations and demands.

A specific type of logistics software that is extremely adept at doing this is supply chain software. This covers the complete logistics process of delivery of a product from seller to buyer.  There are two parts to this software: the sales process and the purchasing process. The purchasing process begins with an order being made and logged into the system with all the details pertaining to the specific order. This information is then sent to the supplier and the merchandise is then sent to the warehouse. The accounts payable then gets a bill, which can be used to pay the provider. This then translates to the sales process where sales and shipping orders can be made and logged into the supply chain software. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21hZ2F5YV93YXJlaG91c2VfbWFuYWdlbWVudF9zeXN0ZW0uYXNweA__" target="_blank"><strong>Knowing More</strong></a> about Warehouse could be helpful to you.

<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Logistics software</a> company, Magaya Corporation is growing and has moved its Northeastern U.S. office and its Brazilian office to be closer to new and existing customers in each of these regions. The Northeastern U.S. office was located in Hoboken, New Jersey. Since opening in 2010, the office has grown with the addition of new employees. The new location is in Jamaica, New York, just a few minutes from the John F. Kennedy International Airport, in a major warehousing and freight district.
<br /><br />The director of the Northeast region for Magaya sales, Daniel Najman, noted the company wanted to be closer to the freight forwarders who are concentrated near JFK. “We have many customers here and we are receiving more requests from companies in this area,” Mr. Najman said. “With growth of about 35% since opening this office 2 years ago, we anticipate more customers and want to be here to provide quality customer service to them.”
<br /><br />The Brazilian office of Magaya was also moved recently. It was located in Sao Paulo, where it opened in 2005. The new office location is in Santos, the largest port in Brazil. The port accounts for 26% of Brazilian trade, according to Reuters News. Plans for the port include it doubling in size by 2012, enabling it to handle more containers. Jose Correia Serra, president of Codesp, which operates the port, said studies show the movement of goods can triple through Santos in 15 years. The Minister of Ports, Leonidas Cristino, said Brazil plans to invest 1.3 billion reais ($813 million) in federal funds over the next four years to expand Santos.
<br /><br />“This means a huge increase in the investment in technology applied to logistics. Magaya is the first <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tLw__" target="_blank">freight forwarding software</a> company to move to this region and we propose to take our full array of products to all the sectors of the supply chain in this region,” said Ignacio Bencomo, Latin American Business Manager for Magaya Corporation. Many US freight forwarders and NVOCCs have partners or branch offices in Brazil. Using Magaya logistics software on both sides of their operations provides real-time tracking across their supply chain, one-time data entry, and reduced communication expenses and labor costs.
<br /><br />Magaya logistics software is the leading choice of start-up companies in the logistics industry. In addition to the New York and Brazil offices, we have offices to serve you, including the corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida and regional offices in Houston, Texas, and Los Angeles, California.

<br /><br />Companies that own any kind of warehouse learn early on that monitoring inventory is critical to financial success. Whether your company is a wholesaler that holds a significant amount of product or you are a small retail store that has a small warehousing operation, you need logistics software to help you run your operations more efficiently. When you have good inventory control software in place, you can monitor the movement of your stock and lower the cost of purchasing items that you do not use. You can see which items sell quickly and which ones sit on the shelves for a long time. It will help you in your purchasing and your sales projection operations.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Logistics software</a>also helps to schedule deliveries and mark products in as soon as they arrive to the warehouse. You can then use your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ludmVudG9yeV9jb250cm9sLmFzcHg_" target="_blank">inventory control software</a> to compare the products you received to the products that were on the purchase order. It helps you to identify products that may be on backorder and to see items that may have been missed in the shipment. You can also find out if anything was shipped that was not part of your order. All of these inventory control activities are critical to making sure that the product that sits on your warehouse shelves is product that you can sell. If you are getting products you did not order, then you may be getting stuck with inventory you cannot use.
<br /><br />Your inventory control software also works in conjunction with your purchasing software to schedule orders based on consumer needs. A company that is buying products after they are out is a company that could be losing orders. But if you use your logistics software to follow product sales and always have your most popular products in stock, then your sales will increase. When you always have stock on hand for the consumers that want it, then you become a preferred vendor for more and more clients. That improves your buying power and will add profit to your bottom line.
<br /><br />Any time you have to maintain any level of inventory you should have inventory control software installed into your computer network. When you use logistics software to its fullest potential, then you are helping to create a more efficient purchasing system that will pay for itself with more sales and higher profits. In any size organization, inventory management is a process that always generates more income when used properly.

This is especially true if you have a long, complex supply chain that needs to be optimized and attended to constantly to perform at its best. Every serious materials and supply professional understands that a minor tweak in your supply chain, using the latest logistics software, can result in huge gains in efficiency and cost control. Over time, this can mean that you save not just thousands, not just tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars says <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21hZ2F5YV9zdXBwbHlfY2hhaW5fc29sdXRpb24uYXNweA__" target="_blank"><em><strong>supply chain software</strong></em></a>company. 
<br /><br />The longer your supply chain is, the more challenging it will be to operate. Inventory control software can help you understand the patterns of behavior that are driving your existing business and how to take advantage of them by tightening up your margins. The more you are able to control and adapt your margins, the more waste you will be able to cut. Certified logistics and inventory professionals swear by logistics software as a way of visualizing their logistical projects and understanding, quickly and intuitively, exactly where improvements can be made. It will truly pay for itself.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL2NvbXBhbnkvaW5kZXguYXNweA__" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182299599_10453839_48842744.jpg" /></a>
<br /><br />A plan to consolidate and optimize logistics is especially important when you are dealing with a global business. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2ludmVudG9yeV9jb250cm9sLmFzcHg_" target="_blank"><em><strong>Inventory control software</strong></em></a> is vital here, as it can help you save an enormous amount of money in both production and shipping costs. Think, for example, about IKEA. The Swedish furniture juggernaut is one of capitalism’s biggest success stories in recent years. One way that it is able to make so much money while continuously expanding in multiple global regions is a central supply plan. This makes it less likely to suffer from an attenuated supply chain. Logistics software can help you develop a similar plan.
<br /><br />If you operate a large or mid-sized enterprise, odds are that many other functions in your business already enjoy the benefits of electronic automation and visualization. Inventory control software is just as important to your bottom line as other tools that you may already use and take for granted every day, such as Customer Relationship Management and the latest information technology applications. Logistics software combines with a strong orientation toward business analysis to provide you with the power of long-term savings that will empower your business. If you haven’t already, now is a good time to consider how enterprise-class logistics automation can benefit you.

Most often, these warehouses are located in industrial areas of cities where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, railways, airports or harbors. The goods may be placed on standard pallets from where they are lifted using cranes and forklifts.
<br /><br />With the advent of logistics software, even warehouses have become automated requiring operators to work and handle all the tasks. The system uses automated conveyors and cranes where pallets and products are made to move. Also, programmable logic controllers and computers running<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21hZ2F5YV93YXJlaG91c2VfbWFuYWdlbWVudF9zeXN0ZW0uYXNweA__" target="_blank"><em> <strong>warehouse software</strong></em></a> automate the storage and retrieval system and are usually installed at refrigerated warehouse to keep the temperatures cool and prevent the product from getting spoiled. An automated storage system may be built up to a height of 40m and is encouraged to efficiently use vertical space. A warehouse can be made to work efficiently by slotting them. Here, the whole system is made to improve its inventory requirements using either FIFO (first-in-first-out) or LIFO (last-in-first-out) procedure. This in turn, controls labor cost and increases productivity.
<br /><br />On the other hand, logistics aims to fulfill the requirements of customers or corporations by managing the flow of goods between the point of origin and point of destination. It may cover an entire range of industries that may include consumer goods such as FMCG (fast moving consumer goods), IT, aerospace, defense, etc. The complete system is a whole sum of information, transportation, inventory, warehousing, material handling, packaging and sometimes, security.

<br /><br />Track assets:  A product in a warehouse is tracked using a bar code or serial number.
<br /><br />Barcodes: These require a special barcode reader that read the codes looking for information of the product.
<br /><br />Manage orders : Companies may avoid running out of products by programming the system to reorder a product once it has reached a certain low level
<br /><br />Manage services: For service companies, it may be easier to track the cost of the materials used in the service.
<br /><br />Distributors, wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers may be helped by grouping and placing products near the delivery area. Such products are usually those that are more popular than others and are readily picked, packed and shipped to customers.

The built-in “System Alerts” feature in all Magaya logistics software can notify you or any employee when a customer places an online order or other LiveTrack transaction. See this month’s how-to tip to learn more.Patrick Oliva, founder of Simple Freight Solutions, started from a home office, but now is doubling his warehouse space to handle the increased volume that each year has brought his New York logistics company. 
<br /><br />When Patrick Oliva started his freight forwarding business out of his home office in 2008, he did not imagine his company would grow so much that he’d move four times in four years and be doubling his warehouse space by the summer of 2012. The company, Simple Freight Solutions, went from Mr. Oliva’s hometown of Bohemia, New York, on Long Island, to renting space at the John F. Kennedy International Airport and back to Bohemia. He chose to return to his neighborhood of Bohemia when he purchased trucks and courier vans for his business and he calculated the cost of the commute to realize he could save 70% in overhead compared to renting space and commuting to JFK.  Saving money is a key component of managing a small business well,  as is having the right partners and technology. 
<br /><br />Mr. Oliva was using different<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><em> <strong>logistics software</strong> </em></a>but soon switched to the Magaya warehouse management software when a friend showed it to him. “When I evaluated the system, I fell in love with it. It’s colorful and easy to use. Not just that, but all the capabilities and the help from my salesperson and the Tech Support team – they really make you feel like Magaya’s got your back.”Approximately 70% of the business at Simple Freight Solutions is imports sent from Asia to the West Coast of the U.S. The other 30% is exports. Commodities they ship and store raw materials for foods; and medical devices. One of their customers from Holland imports pump assemblies to the U.S. to be used to deliver DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) solution to a vehicles holding tank. This is now required for old and new diesel vehicles to help reduce harmful emissions and meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) regulations.
<br /><br />Simple Freight works with FedEx and LTL or FCL carriers (Less Than and Full Container Loads) to provide domestic and international shipments, in addition to using their own trucks for deliveries. Simple Freight Solutions also offers custom crating and packing. For customers who need help with the U.S. Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certifications or classifying commodities, Simple Freight Solutions offers customers a specialist who ensures the correct HTS codes (Harmonized Tariff System) are used for duty rates and that filing of entries with Customs is done correctly.They also provide warehousing services to their customers. “We can give our customers the visibility and inventory control and show them the documents they need to see for their business,” Mr. Oliva said. 
<br /><br />Simple Freight Solutions also uses the online tracking called Magaya LiveTrack, which is included with all the software. “With the tracking, we can offer our customers one-stop shopping: They can see what’s been received, what’s in transit, what’s delivered. All they need is a user name and password.” Using Features as They Grow “When I started my business, I didn’t use the inventory item definitions,” Mr. Oliva said. “But as the company grew, we started to use them,” Mr. Oliva said.
<br /><br />The<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWdheWEuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL21hZ2F5YV93YXJlaG91c2VfbWFuYWdlbWVudF9zeXN0ZW0uYXNweA__" target="_blank"><em> <strong>warehouse management software</strong> </em></a>enables the user to define and save an Inventory Item Definition that includes details about cargo items received regularly such as part numbers, the manufacturer, dimensions and more. When a bar code for a defined item is scanned, the details populate in the software, speeding up cargo receipt, movements, packs and loads, and shipments and reducing errors.  
<br /><br />Mr. Oliva explained that the variety of software features helps his business as it grows. “Some features we don’t use right now, but we know they are there when we need them. We won’t have to buy a new program in the future.”One of the software features they are taking advantage of now is the Custom Fields feature. An example of how they use this feature is how they handle shipments and returns for their Dutch customer that ships diesel pump assemblies. All the parts have serial numbers. 
<br /><br />These numbers must be tracked in the system in case of a return. If a pump or accessory malfunctions, it must be returned and replaced. The return and replacement parts must be tracked by Simple Freight and made available to the customer to see online. All this data is managed in the Magaya Cargo System and can be included in reports. The reports that Mr. Oliva creates from the inventory data and accounting data include a P&amp;L report (profit and loss) and reports that show how many shipments they are processing for a specific client. “The report can be as specific as we like,” he said. “Whatever the needs are, the capabilities are there. And it only takes a couple of clicks.”

When asked about his success, Mr. Oliva attributes it to “good old fashioned hard work and customer service. It’s that simple.” “We also surround ourselves with partners in the industry that meet or exceed our standards of service,” he said. “I believe very strongly that personal service is the key to success. No matter if a customer brings in a small amount of revenue or a large amount, they still get the same quality service.” “Magaya is a partner that helps us get everything done,” he said.
