<br /><br />Had a busy day as usual. Woke up pretty early this morning.. All my aunts turned up at my house today to prepare the dumplings.. Had to help out here and there and to entertain relatives from Malaysia as well.. Kind of busy where I have to prepare my documents for the appt later in the evening. Shag.... Well, the dumplings smell and taste nice... however, somehow i felt a little too oily.. hehe~~  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> Anyway, thanks for all the efforts - mum and aunts.
<br /><br />Had a merry go round when going for my appt in the evening... Suppose to go to Simei after sending my 3rd aunt to tampines. Got the wrong exit and ended up making a very big round... moreover, I can't find the place in the street directory.. gosh~~ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> Think I should get an updated one. Nevertheless, I learnt a new route today. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />oh ya... enjoyable nite.. I just come back from KTV Pub - finally i can relax and enjoy myself once again.

<br /><br />Hmm.. What's on my mind now?? It's all nothing but work - fully planned schedule for tomolo - Yes! It's Sunday but not a rest day for me ya... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> I still got some work to do but... hehehe~~ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> think I shall complete them tomolo before I go off for my appt.
<br /><br />So now... Shoo~~~ Off to bed! Time to Sleep, have a good dream and wake up early later. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Oh ya... hope tomolo can heng heng - strike 4D. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Back already... was watching the channel 8 12am show... about the Netherworld. Pretty nice actually...

<br /><br />Oh no... i really dislike the commercial of Gasby (hope I got the spelling correct). Think be'cos of the song they had. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Hmm.... pretty interesting during these few days....
<br /><br />A wedding just over. A sms from the Groom - &quot;Clear the Carpark! My convoy is existing SLE!&quot; Hahaha~~~ Funny groom, interesting &quot;Sisters&quot; and &quot;Brothers&quot;. However, Brothers not so sporting leh..... purposely dragged time so that don't have to be &quot;Sabo&quot; too long... hahaha~~ Something more interesting... Half way through the Tea-Ceremony, Summon auntie came. All those brothers rushed down to put coupons.. Some manage to put, some can't make it in time (and That's me! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> ) Was quite angry cos that Malay Aunite said it's too late. I already keyed in when I just managed to appeared in front of her.... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> Can't they just do something good - giving us extra time - knowing that there is an blissful event going on? haiz.... for the sake of commission... become so heartless. Anyway, the groom was very kind enough to settle the summons for us... wahahaha.... Thanks, Jason!
<br /><br />Everything went perfectly. 95% of the guests came on time at 8.15pm; The timing for the March Ins were perfect; Solemnization; the montage and highlight screening was good. I'm very satisfied with the entire flow. Another success wedding that I have done!
<br /><br />Know what! After the wedding dinner, most of their friends go down to their pub to celebrate. I went down too.. haha.. so happening~~ Well, saw a no. of TPs on the road, but lucky, they didn't drive home. Haha~~ Was tired but enjoyable. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Now, left with 1 more couple to do. Tomorrow is their ROM and customary 2 weeks away from now. Hmm... this couple is hard to handle in a way that they engaged me to help them but never want to listen, wanna act on their own - end up making confusion and procastinating... Headache <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> Anyway, I just want to make sure that every goes well and no hip-ups along the way - So far, all the weddings I handled turned out good and nice.
<br /><br />Hmm... oh ya.. went for a BBQ on Sat evening. I was one of the organizers - was tired cos the pervious night was the wedding; then got a deal to make on sat morning; then head down to buy all the BBQ stuffs... Really knocked out after that. Phew~
<br />Well, at least turned out fun and busying BBQing.. hahaha~~ And now, I got abit heaty. Gums abit swollen and pain! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> So pityful...............
<br /><br />All the 3-day events - that's why &quot;Eventful Days&quot;. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Weather is rather hot and humid since last week. Got to bath so many times... Unbearable.... To remind all: please drink alot of water. Me too. keke... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Summary:
<br /><br />Friday (15 June 07)
<br /><br />It's all started here... Carrying my laptop and stuffs happily walking down to my car... who knows! 
<br />1. Car was driven out - no car to drive to Rasa Sentosa, 
<br /><br />2. Realised that my wallet was in the car - so ended up with no cash with me, had to walk to the Mcd, with heavy stuffs, where my cousin was waiting for me (suppose to pick her up there)
<br /><br />3. Was having breakfast, almost done with my cup of tea, heavy downpour! Ended up got to call for cab - extra money and effort spent!
<br /><br />4. On the cab towards expressway, struck in a traffic jam. Too occupied with those unpleasant events earlier on, forgotten to ask the driver not to travel by Expressway. Too late, afterall.
<br /><br />Well, in the end, spent quite alot on the cabfare which I could have top up my car to the max. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />5. On top of this. Regarding my service provider - No biz enthics, principles and integrity - Supposingly agreed on the cut to my company; agreeing on his service much earlier. In the end, he can't make it and referred another friend of his to replace him (I am okay with that since he has yet meet up with my couple - by right it shouldn't be in this case where you already agreed to provide your service to my couple - but I accommodate him)and now claimed that nothing has been agreed on (I even email him those corresponds to him for verification on this issue); his friend don't give any cut and still suggested that I should t/f in full. I shall not give him any deal in future. That will be the end of our collaboration. Really upset and angry with these kind of people. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wacko.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Someone suggested that I should just give them the balance, dont' take the cut, and forget about it. Isn't it allowing them to bully me and at a losing end? Haiz~~ Just becos of the $75.00. Funny right?
<br /><br />Well.......... was going to genting to witness the Guiness 9 Ball tour in the evening.
<br /><br />Tgt everything should be fine.... Haha~~ Guess what! So decide to try my luck - if it was proven that I'm down of luck - Tried 3 times in the casino and really can't make it. Haha~~ and sorry for the man whom I placed my bet on top of his... haha~~ Then decided to go and sleep. Try again next day~
<br /><br />Sat (16 June 07)
<br /><br />Nothing happen today. Hmm.... the only good thing is that being able to be on live on ESPN. haha~~ Can see me there with my team mates. Woohoo~~ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> Catch me in there if you can. haha~~
<br />Well, did try my luck again... but really no luck again. Haha~~
<br />Anyway, overall is an average trip, at least take some time off from work. Was back at about 3.30am... so shag~  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Today - Sun (17 June 07)
<br /><br />Hmm... slept for almost whole day... so long didn't sleep like that already.. haha
<br /><br />Everything went on fine... Until I received a msg from my sis that something happened to the car......... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />  My bro just banged onto a taxi while doing a reverse parking at my blk carpark. I just saw how bad the damage was... think he must be in a fast speed....
<br /><br />Bringing my car to the &quot;clinic&quot; tomorrow. Haiz~ And almost all guys have an ego. Still have to urgue with me when I tell my bro what we should do in this case - in terms of the insurance issue. Haiz~~ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Heartache!

<br />And yes! 1994 till 2007. It's has been 13 Years of friendship and we still keep in touch with one another. Of cos, some of them are already out of MCD, however, some are still in the big family; some of them already married with kids; some married; some single; and of cos some attached. Wahaha..... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Friends are hard to come by; memories will be forever remain in our mind so long we shall live. 
<br />It was really filled with great, fun, happening, crazy and lovely memories, not forgetting, some unhappiness as well. Those were the days~~ <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />  Nevertheless, all these were over and all of us stil make the effort to meetup once in awhile despite our hectic work schedule and personal commitments. It's all about how each of us see in this friendship.
<br /><br />Really nice to know all of you. And by chances or the fate that brought us together, we must treasure this long long r/s. I shall see you guys again in the Chalet in Sept 07. Hurray~~
<br /><br />Yours sincerely,
<br />Von
