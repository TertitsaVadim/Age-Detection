<br />If there is any single thing that really took over the basketball sneaker industry last year, it would definitely have to be the Hyper line form Nike. As we’ve seen with the original Hyperfuse, the Hyperfuse 2011 is set to drop in a wide variety of colorways starting this summer.The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGUta2lja3MuY29tL2Jhc2tldGJhbGwtc2hvZXMtbmlrZS1oeXBlcmR1bmstMjAxMS1jLTE3Xzc1Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Hyperfuse 2011</a></strong> continues to be a favorite amongst basketball players, and has been seen in a variety of designs so far this year.There were a few different shoes that came as a part of this lineup, but it just about instantly became the go-to shoe for <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGUta2lja3MuY29tL2Jhc2tldGJhbGwtc2hvZXMtYy0xNy5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike basketball</a></strong> players all over the world, including those in the NBA. Each shoe had its own version for 2010, but as Nike fans we all know that they wouldn’t just sit back and let their fans wear a shoe marked 2010 in the year 2011. Today we are going to be looking at the latest version with this new <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGUta2lja3MuY29tL25pa2Utem9vbS1oeXBlcmZ1c2UtMjAxMS13aGl0ZS1tZXRhbGxpYy1sdXN0ZXItc3BvcnQtcmVkLXAtMjQ5My5odG1s" target="_blank">Nike Zoom Hyperfuse 2011 White Red</a></strong>, Metallic Luster and Sport Red.Emblazoned with an emblem that would make a Rolls Royce driver double take, the newest Nike Zoom Hyperfuse 2011 is a surefire to get noticed on the court. Then again, you’d have to be able to actually utilize the Zoom Air nikes sneakers and lightweight Hyperfuse upper to ensure you actually get picked. Either way, the white and Sport Red colorway seen here is great for on court performance.
<br /><br />Here’s our first look at this colorway, which features a black and sport red Hyperfuse composite upper. The branding plate, medial Swoosh and tongue Hyperfuse notation are also done in red, while black works the tongue, inner liner, laces and outsole. The lateral Swoosh is finished in the same metallic luster look we’ve seen used on several pairs of the Hyperfuse 2011, as well as the Air Shox Hyperballer.Shown here is a new version that has started making its way to accounts, including Eastbay. The nikes shoes features a predominantly white upper which consists of perforations and hyperfuse technology. The bland upper is contrasted by silver, red, and orange accents.

Initial releases were classic university colors, but new non-team colors were soon introduced. At this time, Nike often released the same dunk in two different versions consisting of reversed colors. The dunks released from 1998 to 2000 featured a nylon tongue and arch supports, distinguishing them from today's dunk releases. Overall, the reintroduction of the dunk proved to be extremely successful and production numbers have since increased to meet growing demand.Nike's basketball shoe line was fairly popular in the skateboarding scene, and the Dunk soon became a popular shoe for skaters due to the stability and lower profile sole which improved grounding performance. In 2002, Nike created a Dunk specifically for skateboarders, known as the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGUtc2hvZS5vcmcv" target="_blank">Nike Dunk SB</a></strong>. It features an extra-padded &quot;puffy tongue&quot; (common among skateboarding sneakers) and Nike's patented Zoom Air insole. Since then, the SB Dunk has become a popular icon for enthusiastic sneaker-collectors, and has hit the streetwear fashion scene. Nike currently collaborates with many designers to create special edition and collectible Dunks. The popularitiy of these dunks has grown so wide that it has prompted Nike to create many other kinds of shoes specifically for skateboarding such Paul Rodriguez's, Tre's, Blazer's, and Team Editions to name a few. These shoes mimic the colorways and limited quantities of that of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aG9sZXNhbGUtc2hvZS5vcmcvbmlrZS1kdW5rcy1jLTIzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Nike Dunks</a></strong>, which increases their value and appeal.
