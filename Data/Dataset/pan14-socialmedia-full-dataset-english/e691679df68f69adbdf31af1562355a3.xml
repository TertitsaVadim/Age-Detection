<br />Is this just fantasy?
<br />Caught in a landslide,
<br />No escape from reality.
<br />Open your eyes,
<br />Look up to the skies and see,
<br />I'm just a poor boy,
<br />I need no sympathy,
<br />Because I'm easy come, easy go,
<br />Little high, little low,
<br />Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.
<br />Mama, just killed a man,
<br />Put a gun against his head,
<br />pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
<br />Mama, life had just begun,
<br />But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
<br />Mama, ooh,
<br />Didn't mean to make you cry,
<br />If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
<br />Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
<br />Too late, my time has come,
<br />Sends shivers down my spine,
<br />body's aching all the time.
<br />Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
<br />Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
<br />Mama, ooh,
<br />I don't want to die,
<br />I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
<br />I see a little silhouetto of a man,
<br />Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.
<br />Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.
<br />(Galileo.) Galileo.
<br />(Galileo.) Galileo,
<br />Galileo figaro Magnifico.
<br />I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
<br />He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
<br />Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
<br />Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.
<br />Bismillah!
<br />No, we will not let you go. (Let him go!)
<br />Bismillah!
<br />We will not let you go. (Let him go!)
<br />Bismillah!
<br />We will not let you go. (Let me go.)
<br />Will not let you go. (Let me go.)
<br />Will not let you go. (Let me go.)
<br />Ah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
<br />(Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go.
<br />Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.
<br />So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
<br />So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
<br />Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
<br />Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.
<br />Nothing really matters,
<br />Anyone can see,
<br />Nothing really matters,
<br />Nothing really matters to me.
<br />Any way the wind blows.

<br />Of the next in line

<br />Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
<br />You're lying safe in bed
<br />It was all a bad dream

<br />Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
<br />Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
<br />So here it is, another chance
<br />Wide awake you face the day
<br />Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
<br /><br />There's a place I like to hide
<br />A doorway that I run through in the night
<br />Relax child, you were there
<br />But only didn't realize it and you were scared
<br />It's a place where you will learn
<br />To face your fears, retrace the years
<br />And ride the whims of your mind
<br />Commanding in another world
<br />Suddenly you hear and see
<br />This magic new dimension
<br /><br />I will be watching over you
<br />I am gonna help you see it through
<br />I will protect you in the night
<br />I am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
<br /><br />[Visualize your dream]
<br />[Record it in the present tense]
<br />[Put it into a permanent form]
<br />[If you persist in your efforts]
<br />[You can achieve dream control]
<br />[Dream control]
<br />[How's that then, better?]
<br />[Hug me]
<br /><br />If you open your mind for me
<br />You won't rely on open eyes to see
<br />The walls you built within
<br />Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
<br />Living twice at once you learn
<br />You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
<br />A soul set free to fly
<br />A round trip journey in your head
<br />Master of illusion, can you realize
<br />Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
<br /><br />I will be watching over you
<br />I am gonna help to see it through
<br />I will protect you in the night
<br />I am smiling next to you....
