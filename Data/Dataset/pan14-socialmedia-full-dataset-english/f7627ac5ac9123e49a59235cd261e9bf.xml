The paid memberships are usually for the blogger who goes all out, like publishing once or twice every single day, or even for the people that have more than one blog. This is a quite simple plugin that is developed for wordpress, and when you add a post to your blog, Only wire is going to take that post and distribute it to social bookmarking sites for you on auto-pilot. Therefore each and every time you post an article it is published on these other sites, thereby developing you links to the actual post page.<br /><br />One more thing I suggest you do is to utilize article marketing to build links to each and every page. And you might be thinking, &quot;isn't Only wire more than enough?&quot;, the answer is no, it isn't, you want as many links as possible. So once you subscribe to only wire you should start searching for a article submission website or software program. You can find one program that I use called &quot;Unique Article Wizard&quot; and it actually makes this process very simple. OK so you now have to make up another article with regards to the article you just put up. You then create 2 rewrites of that article, and make sure that every article has the same amount of paragraphs. You then login to your &quot;UAW&quot; account and have them publish the articles for you. Make sure you set up a resource box along with one link which points back to the home page of your blog and the second link should be pointing to the page you just published on your blog. This is often a little time consuming however, you will find that it is definitely worth the effort you put in.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ziki.com%2Fen%2Falejandro-riddle-1%2B285159%2Fpost%2FGetting-Traffic-For-Your-Blog-Is-A-Lot-Easier-Than-You-Think-And-We-Teach-You-How-To-Do-It%2B12874141"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziki.com/en/alejandro-riddle-1+285159/post/Getting-Traffic-For-Your-Blog-Is-A-Lot-Easier-Than-You-Think-And-We-Teach-You-How-To-Do-It+12874141</a> , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwallinside.com%2Fpost-181272.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://wallinside.com/post-181272.html</a>
