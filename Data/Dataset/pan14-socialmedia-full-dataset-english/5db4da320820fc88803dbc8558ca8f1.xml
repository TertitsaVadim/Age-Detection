Both my parents have now ended their lives with a slow descent into the full throes of this terrible disease.<br /><br />My father (who died some years ago) was also effectively deaf and blind, immobile and doubly incontinent at the end. My mother is still physically fairly robust at 92, but has finally completely disappeared emotionally, spiritually and mentally to leave no signs of the person she once was. And it is a painful thing - this grieving for someone who is still alive.<br /><br />This article, by the UK Times newspaper columnist, A A Gill, who lost his father to Alzheimer's disease captures the heartache: Disease with Dreadful Sadness for Carers.<br /><br />The massive explosion in Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia has been paralleled by the rise in autism and behavioural disorders in children - and by the advent of 'mysterious' disorders and syndromes such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and autoimmune disease in the last few decades. <br /><br />The question arises: Do they have a common cause? <br /><br />Many think that they do and provide compelling evidence that the increasing use of mercury in both medicine and dentistry in recent decades is responsible for these conditions - coupled with an inherited ability or inability to detoxify mercury which has helped to confound making the link. The evidence and the issues involved are explored below.<br /><br />Alzheimer's disease: The statistics <br />The allopathic world maintains that Alzheimer's disease is largely a genetic disease and (as ever) with yet more research money they will be able to find a 'cure'. But this is patently nonsense.<br /><br />Over half the population in the developed world will currently end their days with Alzheimer's disease if they live to be 85 or over. The earliest recorded case is now in someone aged 28, and 40 and 50 year olds are now being diagnosed fairly regularly with the condition. One in ten people aged 65-75 years and one in five people aged 75-85 will also succumb to this living death. <br /><br />More than 4 million Americans now have Alzheimer's disease and over 750,000 people in the UK have dementia according to the latest statistics. Which puts Alzheimer's disease in the epidemic category. <br /><br />This is not remotely 'normal' - and it's not genetic. If it were, then there would be a long and overwhelming history of half the population ending their days with this paralysing dementia. <br /><br />Others claim that this is an inevitable aspect of living longer, but even that oft quoted chestnut is not entirely true - because we are not really living that much longer than we were 150 years ago if you take out neonatal and child mortality. And many manage to live into great old age with all their faculties - so there is nothing inevitable about the decline into insensibility. <br /><br />The first symptoms of this disease are difficulty concentrating and variable degrees of memory loss, leading ultimately to devastating mental deterioration. The brains of people with Alzheimer's disease shrink by 25 percent and have distinct pathologic hallmarks (neurofibillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and phosphorylation of tau protein).<br /><br />&quot;There is a peculiar and particular hammering sadness for those that love and care for an Alzheimer’s spouse or parent. It is a wearying and lonely obligation, but with the added cruelty that the person you’re looking after vanishes, escapes before your eyes. In the end, you’re caring for the case that someone came in.&quot;<br /><br />A A Gill<br /><br />Autism: The statistics<br />Autism was first identified by the author of Child Psychiatry, Leo Kanner, in 1931 in the USA and from these few early cases, it has grown to affect approximately 1 in 110 children today according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Asperger's Syndrome too was identified approximately ten years later by the Austrian paediatrician, Hans Asperger.<br /><br />The difference between the two diseases is one of degree with both conditions being characterised by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialisation and communication. In addition to those diagnosed with autism and Asperger's syndrome, there are many more children who are unable to concentrate, and who are restless and have difficulty communicating normally. <br /><br />Some suggest that the labels 'autism' and 'Asperger's syndrome' be abandoned and that all autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) be placed on a severity scale or that they be reclassified as Pervasive Development Disorders (PDD). <br /><br />In the US, there are 100,000 new cases of autism diagnosed every year with more than one million children having been diagnosed over the last 30 years. There is no geographic or ethnic pattern to those affected, but all autistic spectrum disorders are 3-4 times more common in boys, and also occur more frequently in the first born and to children of older parents.  <br /><br />A typical case involves a healthy boy who stops developing and communicating some time prior to his second birthday. He starts to avoid eye contact, becomes strange and aloof and retreats into his own inner world. There are usually visual, coordination, gait, speech and digestive problems accompanied by immune dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and unprovoked emotional outbursts. <br /><br />&quot;It was as though he were in his own little world. It was like there was nobody home. He was a shell of the boy he had been before that had been energetic and had personality. It was like the movie 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. He was gone. He was literally gone from us.&quot;<br /><br />Lyn Redwood, mother of a recovered autistic child <br /><br />Alzheimer's disease and autism: The similarities<br />For anyone who has spent any amount of time in the company of individuals suffering with Alzheimer's and autism, the similarities between the two diseases are striking - although they affect different ends of the lifespan. In fact, there are over 160 similarities between autism and Alzheimer's disease. Listed below are just some of the more obvious parallels. With both conditions there is:<br /><br />A profound impact on memory making everyday functioning and recognition of faces and voices impossible  <br />A lethargy, passivity, and loss of energy <br />A loss of intellect and an inability to concentrate, sequence and complete tasks coupled with a lack of comprehension which profoundly impacts everyday life<br />A sensory overload with sufferers having difficulty processing sensory information such that they withdraw from social contact, prefer being on their own and avoid eye contact <br />A catatonic state, with blank, emotionless expressions, and flat or monotone speech and a lack of comprehension of others feelings and/or meaning<br />Usually an ability to read, but not to understand what is read<br />Common physical markers include: poorly controlled insulin levels, sensitivity to gluten and/or casein, low levels of essential fatty acids, specific brain abnormalities, abnormal mineral and neurotransmitter levels, elevated homocysteine, characteristic immune system abnormalities, low glutathione levels, vitamin B and E deficiencies, etc.<br />Difficulties with balance and gait, poor coordination, restless constant movement, 'flapping' and grimacing<br />A stubborn attachment to routines and repetitive behaviours and odd and/or inappropriate behaviours<br />No understanding of orientation in time or space, indeed little comprehension of 'self' and 'non-self'   <br />Changes in appetite and usually weight loss<br />Disrupted sleep<br />Aggression, agitation, hyperactivity, anxiety, fears, depression, mood swings, rages, and unprovoked and uncontrollable crying/laughter and<br />Digestive system problems with ultimate loss of continence.<br /><br />Environmental factors: Mercury<br />Over the last 500 years there is estimated to have been a 1,000 fold increase in the amount of toxic metals stored within our bodies, primarily lead, cadmium, aluminium and mercury. And all these metals are highly synergistic with each other and also with other environmental toxins and biotoxins produced by microorganisms within the body. <br /><br />These toxic metals are effectively 'mistaken' by the body for their innocent naturally occurring mineral cousins and incorporated into all body tissues and enzyme systems. Of all the metals, mercury is the most destructive of neural tissue being the second most toxic element known.<br /><br />Although, as epidemiologists are fond of reminding us 'association is not causation', during the rapid growth in the prevalence of these disorders there has been the introduction - and the massive expansion - of the vaccination programme (with the use of the mercury-based preservative, thimerasol), and the universal introduction of high copper amalgam in the 1970s (which releases 50X the mercury of the previous formulation). <br /><br />There are different forms of &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url], although all are highly toxic and infants are known to acquire between one-third and two-thirds of their mother's toxin load in the womb and via the breast milk. For the last few decades infants have then been subjected to repeated doses of the mercury based preservative (thimerasol) and aluminium (added as an adjuvant) via the vaccination programme. Thimerasol is the most toxic organic form of mercury and is, of course, injected directly into the body of a small child with an immature immune system. <br /><br />Older individuals are most likely to have acquired most of their mercury burden from their &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url], and this is mostly in the form of elemental mercury vapour which is then converted within the tissues of the body into its inorganic mercurous and/or organic mercuric forms.<br /><br />A secondary source of mercury exposure for adults is the vaccination programme and a tertiary source is fish consumption (WHO 1991). However, both of these sources provide mercury in its most toxic, organic form which has been shown to be at least 100X more toxic than elemental mercury. <br /><br />&quot;Early manifestations (of chronic mercury toxicity) are likely to be subtle and diagnosis difficult: Insomnia, nervousness, mild tremor, impaired judgment and coordination, decreased mental efficiency, emotional lability, headache, fatigue, loss of sexual drive and depression are often mistakenly ascribed to psychogenic causes”.  <br /><br />Medical text<br /><br />For possibly obvious reasons, although public health bodies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency are happy to warn of the potential for neurological injury to an estimated one in six infants from fish consumption by the mother while pregnant, they overlook the greatest sources: amalgam fillings and vaccinations.<br /><br />The foetus is known to accumulate mercury at up to twice the rate of the mother and the developing nervous system of the foetus is also sensitive to mercury at levels far below those considered toxic in adults. There are also known to be 'vulnerable periods' during development of the brain and central nervous system during which exposure to neurotoxins such as mercury can profoundly and possibly permanently affect neurological development processes. <br /><br />Although mercury is known to inflict direct catastrophic neurological damage, it can also cause collateral damage via other mechanisms such as:<br /><br />Disabling the immune system<br />Causing massive oxidative stress<br />Decreasing lithium (which is protective of the brain)<br />Depleting glutathione which is critical for mercury elimination<br />Destroying the enzyme required for conversion of the fatty acid, EPA, which results in widespread inflammation and impacts the development of both red and white blood cells thus decreasing oxygenation to the tissues (particularly important in the brain) <br />Blocking the production of digestive enzymes required to digest gluten in grains and casein in milk. This causes these foodstuffs to release neurotoxic morphine-like substances that can cause the psychosis associated with autism and ADHD.<br /><br />Many suspect that thimerasol and aluminium in vaccines are responsible for the lion's share of the neurological damage witnessed in children. However, others such as the neurologist, Dr Russell Blaylock, suggest that it is the number of vaccines given and especially the live vaccines such as MMR which cause 'collateral' brain damage. <br /><br />Of course, the authorities concerned (the American Academy of Pediatrics, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the American Academy of Family Physicians) famously claimed in a joint statement that there was “no evidence of harm” resulting from exposure to thimerasol in vaccines.<br /><br />And in an article by the FDA advisory member, Paul Offit, in the medical journal Pediatrics in 2002 the good doctor estimated that each child could theoretically respond to 10,000 vaccines at one time without adverse effect. Which begs the question: if the immune system of a child is that robust, why do they need vaccinating at all?<br /><br />Mercury causation of Alzheimer's disease: The evidence<br />Listed below is just some of the more compelling evidence linking mercury toxicity to Alzehimer's disease. <br /><br />Alzheimer's disease was first described in 1906 - just a few decades after the widespread introduction of amalgam fillings.<br />Alzheimer's disease sufferers have 2-3 times the brain mercury levels found in unaffected people.<br />People with more amalgam fillings have been shown to have significantly more neurological, memory, mood, and behavioural problems than control groups. <br />Early life exposure to mercury has also been shown to cause subtle deterioration in neural development which may only become apparent in middle age - and exposures are cumulative throughout life (mercury has a half-life in the central nervous system of 27 years).<br />Experiments on rats exposed to the levels of mercury vapour found in the oral air of people with several amalgam fillings showed that brain mercury increased increased 11 - 47 fold (Pendergrass et al, Neurotoxicology, 1997). <br />Animals exposed to the amounts of mercury found in people with an average number of fillings developed all the biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (Pendergrass et al, Neurotoxicology, 1997). <br />Having regular mercury-containing flu shots for 3-5 years was shown to increase the odds of contracting Alzheimer’s disease by a factor of ten compared to those who had one, two or no shots (Fudenberg, Internat. J. Clin. Invest., 2000 &amp; 2004).<br />Dr Boyd Haley has demonstrated that the signature changes in brain morphology associated with Alzheimer's disease can be induced by exposing neurons to the levels of mercury found in an adult with a large number of amalgam fillings.<br />The SPECT scans shown below show the massive neurological destruction of the central nervous system demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease and the images of the damage done to a single neuron 30 minutes after exposure to a dilute mercury solution.<br /><br />Construction and repair of the nervous system requires the structural protein tubulin be created to provide support for the neuron. Mercury interferes with the ability of the proteins involved to dock together. <br />Dr Boyd Haley and his team have demonstrated that radioactively labelled mercury from dental amalgam fillings placed in sheep accumulates at very high levels in the areas of the brain associated with memory (the cerebral cortex and hippocampus). <br />Of all the metals, only mercury has been shown to cause the abnormal biochemistry and neurofibillary tangles typical of Alzheimer's disease, although aluminium has been shown to dramatically potentiate the destructive actions of mercury.<br />In patients diagnosed with chronic mercury toxicity (CMT), nearly 90% exhibited memory loss (Wojcik et al, Neuro Endocrinol Lett. 2006 Aug).<br /><br />Mercury causation of autism: The evidence<br />Some of the evidence linking autism to mercury toxicity includes: <br /><br />Autism was first described just a few years after thimerasol was added to the pertussis vaccine in both the US, and later in Europe. <br />Researchers at Stony Brook Medical School found that boys that had received the thimerasol-containing hepatitis B vaccination were 9 times more likely to be enrolled in special education services, and were 3 times more likely to have autism when compared to boys that had not (Gallagher and Goodman, J. of Toxicol and Env. Health, 2010).<br />A study in monkeys showed that a single thimerasol-containing Hepatitis B vaccine at birth has been associated with delayed development of innate reflexes (Hewitson et al, Neurology 2009).<br />A study conducted by the US Center for Disease Control identified an association between live thimerasol injections and autism and PDD (Verstraeten et al, 1999).  <br />Autistic children appear to be unable to eliminate mercury and this was first revealed by hair analysis when ASD children exhibited lower than normal levels of mercury (0.47 ppm versus 3.63 ppm in controls) in their hair samples. Also, those with the lowest mercury levels in their hair samples were the most profoundly affected (Holmes et al, Int J Toxicol. 2003).<br />Mothers of autistic children were also found to have significantly higher levels of mercury exposure from a variety of sources than mothers of the control group. <br />Higher exposure to mercury and lead, especially in combination, prior to age 1 has been shown to correlate with a higher incidence of autism diagnoses (Schweikert et al, 2009).<br />Children with autism have been shown to have low levels of glutathione, an antioxidant that detoxifies the body against heavy metals (James et al, American J. of Clin. Nut., 2004). <br />The statistics relating to autism prevalence can also be explained by the toxicity theory. First, older parents have accumulated a greater toxin burden which the mother then passes to her first born. The fact that ASD are 3-4 times more common in boys is a function of the fact that the male brain matures more slowly than the female brain, and also the interaction with testosterone which greatly enhances the neurotoxicity of mercury.<br />Research on primates has shown that organic mercury can be converted into inorganic mercury within the brain where it accumulates causing the kinds of brain cell dysfunction and inflammation found in patients with autism (Burbacher et al, Env. Health Persp., 2005). <br />In a U.S. government funded study conducted in 2005 by the NIH, at least twice as much inorganic mercury was found to be retained in the brains of animals injected with ethylmercury (thimerasol) compared to those that ingested methylmercury.<br />Vaccinations were first introduced in 1910 with the smallpox vaccine. The first recorded cases of autism and Asperger's syndrome respectively occurred in the 1930s in the US and in the 1940s in Europe. In the 1950s there were 8 vaccines to 5 diseases and the autism rate was 1 in 10,000. In the 1980s there were vaccinations to 11 diseases and an autism rate of 1 in 2,600, and this rose to a total of 40 vaccinations recommended in the 1990s and an autism rate of 1 in 350. Now, the current US mandated vaccines have risen to 58 vaccinations to 15 diseases of which 33 vaccinations are administered before the age of 2 and an autism rate of 1 in 110. Although this is an association it fits with the theory of mercury causation of ASD.<br /><br />&quot;I think that the biological case against Thimerasol is so dramatically overwhelming that only a very foolish or a very dishonest person with the credentials to understand this research would say that Thimerasol wasn’t most likely the cause of autism.&quot;<br /><br />Dr. Boyd E. Haley<br /><br />Since thimerasol has been replaced in some vaccines as a preservative, autism rates have started falling.<br />Last, but not least, is the fact that chelation and detoxification of mercury has resulted in recovery for many ASD children as documented by Stan Kurtz on his website <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.recoveryvideos.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.recoveryvideos.com</a> and by Dr Rashid Buttar at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drbuttar.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.drbuttar.com</a>.<br /><br />Inherited capacity for mercury detoxification<br />A critical determining factor in susceptibility to not only autism and Alzheimer's disease, but also schizophrenia, autoimmune disease and fatigue syndromes appears to be one's genetically programmed ability to rid the body of mercury. <br /><br />The brain has a protein (apolipoprotein or APO) which is responsible for removing dangerous waste products including mercury, and which comes as either APO-E2, E3 or E4. APO-E3 can carry 1 atom of mercury out of the brain, APO-E2 can carry 2 atoms and AOP-E4, no atoms.<br /><br />Our genetic inheritance determines which combination of genes we have. For those that have inherited two APO-E4 proteins, there is an 80 percent chance of acquiring Alzheimer's disease. Both Alzheimer's disease sufferers and autistic children have also been shown to have a huge preponderance of APO-E4 protein in their brains. Whereas, the APO-E2 allele - being the most efficient - may have a protective effect. <br /><br />If both your parents got Alzheimer's disease (as mine have), then there is a very high probability that you have had the misfortune to have inherited APO-E4 from both parents. Putting aside concerns about Alzheimer's disease, this allele is also responsible for 15 years of additional brain ageing according to a study conducted by Dr Stephanie Debette at Boston University. And this may account for the memory lapses in mid-life that have been associated with the later onset of Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />Old Order Amish are often studied when it comes to environmental and genetic factors because the older Amish have eschewed the vaccination programme and because their lineage can be clearly documented. <br /><br />Both Alzheimer's disease and autism are rare amongst Old Order Amish. A study which examined the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and apolipoprotein E allele frequencies in this group concluded that the lower rates of incidence were not due to a reduced frequency of the APO-E4 allele (Pericak-Vance et al, Ann Neurol., 1996). <br /><br />In addition, inherited traits relating to the ability to detoxify mercury via the methylation pathway in both the liver and the cells may play a role and impairment of this pathway has been shown to be associated with mood disorders and depression. <br /><br />Preventing Alzheimer's disease and autism<br />Both these illnesses brings into question the whole concept of consciousness and the nature of reality since the robotic body 'suit' seems to live on while the unique individual disappears. <br /><br />&quot;It is a wearying and lonely obligation, but with the added cruelty that the person you’re looking after vanishes, escapes before your eyes. In the end, you’re caring for the case that someone came in.&quot;<br /><br />A A Gill<br /><br />Many millions more are destined to suffer for lifetimes entirely unnecessarily because of allopathic medicine's refusal to concede that illness in general is caused by toxicity. And many more lives will be dashed on the iceberg of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias caused ironically by the deployment of the second most toxic substance known to man - mercury - in healthcare. <br /><br />A A Gill mentions in his article his daughter's fear that he too will be claimed by Alzheimer's disease, just like his father. And he says that there are no guarantees - which, of course, is true. However, there is a lot you can do - and the time to do it is long before the diagnosis. For a self-help programme of mercury detoxification please refer to Chronic Fatigue, ME and Fibromyalgia: The Natural Recovery Plan.<br /><br />Furthermore following this toxic metal detoxification programme prior to pregnancy and being fully conversant with the dangers inherent in vaccinations and making informed choices for your child(ren) may help to reduce the chances of your child's entire life being lost to an autistic spectrum disorder.

This is a simple, powerful, free and easy test to help you to help yourself back to health.<br /><br />Muscle testing and kinesiology<br />Muscle testing is the basis of kinesiology which uses light pressure applied by the therapist usually to the client's arm, but sometimes to the leg, to assess whether the individual being tested is strengthened or weakened by substances or other issues. <br /><br />This is a binary system, so that effectively only weak or strong responses are elicited. Having said that, computers work entirely on a binary system of coding (0 or 1) and we all appreciate how complex information can be transmitted using this simple system. <br /><br />Kinesiology is the art and science of muscle testing to elicit these responses to a variety of substances or emotional issues.<br /><br />DIY muscle testing<br />You can try the muscle testing technique shown in this video for yourself by using a light weight of some sort.<br /><br />Muscle testing foods <br />First, you may want to muscle test yourself to foods such as dairy products and/or wheat. Holding the weight in your hand as shown, first establish the ease and range of movement on both sides of your body whilst holding the weight. Then, with your other hand, hold the food being tested against your upper abdomen and repeat. <br /><br />If your range or ease of movement is diminished this means that the food being tested has a detrimental effect upon the biodynamic system that you know as your body. <br /><br />If your range or ease of motion is unaffected then the foodstuff probably has a neutral effect and if it is enhanced, then these foods are supportive of your health. <br /><br />This can also depend upon how the particular food has been grown, treated and stored so that apples in general may be supportive, but one particular batch may be neutral or detrimental to your health. Most people, for instance, will muscle test strong to pure water and most will muscle test weak to processed, sugary foods, margarine or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Other applications<br />Muscle testing supplements<br />You can also use this muscle testing technique to test supplements in the same way as foods and so dynamically tailor your needs on a weekly, monthly or occasional basis.<br /><br />Muscle testing appliances <br />You can expand this muscle test to include testing appliances such as your cell phone or any appliances that you keep next to the bed.<br /><br />Muscle testing locations <br />Various locations in your house or office may unknowingly be adversely affecting you and you can assess these too using this muscle test.<br /><br />Muscle testing emotional issues <br />You may also care to experiment with the emotional aspects of this muscle testing technique. Pretest as described above. Then, thinking about someone you love and/or saying their name repeat the muscle test and note the result. Then think of someone with whom you have a difficult or problematic relationship and/or say their name and repeat. You may be surprised to discover that even thinking about this person profoundly affects all your energy circuitry temporarily!<br /><br />Muscle testing dental work <br />The muscle testing technique shown can be valuable to assess which dental restorations and dental crowns (if any) might be adversely affecting your health. Systematically touch all your teeth repeating the muscle test and making a note of the responses. Please note that the responses elicited using muscle testing may be counter-intuitive so that dental restorations or dental crowns that are adversely affecting you when touched can cause an increase in strength and range of movement. <br /><br />I cannot currently offer an explanation as to why this is so, other than to suggest that when touching a problematic dental restoration or &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam filling[/url] crown you enable a ‘dammed’ energy to flow. If no adverse mucle testing responses are elicited, then your dental restorative status and/or oral health may not be a causative issue in your chronic or fatiguing illness. However, if your muscle testing responses change dramatically on contacting individual teeth then you may need to give consideration to your oral health and/or replacing dental restorations or dental crowns at some stage in order to recover.<br /><br />How does muscle testing work?<br />As you can see, muscle testing is a valuable tool that can be used in a multiplicity of ways. How does it work? Well, I don't think anyone has the ultimate answer to that one - other than to say that it does and that the information gained from muscle testing proves to be valuable and accurate especially when assessed over time. Different explanations can be offered. All involve the meridian system used by acupuncturists which is a system of energy flows within the body that have been carefully mapped and used in the East over millennia. <br /><br />All also involve regarding the body as more than a mechanistic lump of flesh that is separate from the universe that surrounds it. Some believe that muscle testing may be accessing your vast subconscious mind, some your supraconscious mind, others the innate intelligence of your body and yet others think that this reality is a holographic simulation and that you are effectively accessing the universal database! <br /><br />Take your pick, but ultimately it doesn't matter if you find the information gained from muscle testing to be valuable and true.<br /><br />The adverse effects of dental restorations<br />The effect that dental restorations have upon the energy systems of the body may be many-fold. First, the metals used in dental restorations may be toxic in and of themselves and this is certainly the case with dental amalgam which contains half liquid mercury which causes &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url]. There are also electrical and galvanic actions between the various different metals used in dental restorations and dental crowns which may account for some of the effect. Finally, and significantly, all the meridians flow through the teeth and implanting any form of metal dental restoration or dental crown within the body may serve to act as an efficient barrier to these meridian energy flows.<br /><br />The intelligent body<br />One thing that you do realise as a kinesiologist, is that there is no such thing as perfect health. The body is constantly dynamically responding to a whole host of influences both internal and external and there are all sorts of means of compensation built into the system. Many muscular aches and pains in the limbs, for example, are ultimately related to the function of internal organs that may be in distress and the muscles becoming tense is a ‘safety valve’ for these vital organs where function must be preserved at all costs. <br /><br />You also come to understand that the body is always doing the most intelligent and least damaging thing that it can do under any given set of circumstances, however mystifying that may seem to us at the time. Treating the symptom – in this case the muscular spasm – will do little to resolve the issue which will recur with treatment only ever providing temporary relief until the cause is identified and addressed. For example, both shoulder pain - especially on the right hand side and knee pain or stiffness may relate to underlying gall bladder problems.

A series of small bones or ossicles in the middle ear then transmit this vibration to a membranous window in the cochlea. The cochlea looks like a snail shell and contains a membranous structure which is filled with fluid within the bony cavity. The cochlea and the adjacent vestibular apparatus are part of the inner ear which is encased in bone.<br /><br />The cochlea is divided along its length into three compartments of which the upper and lower compartments are continuous and filled with a fluid known as perilymph. As the ossicles vibrate the membranous window, this in turn creates vibrations within the perilymph which travel the length of the cochlea in the upper compartment and then back in the lower compartment to be discharged by another membranous window within the middle ear.<br /><br />The vibrations set up within the perilymph are transmitted to a middle membranous compartment filled with endolymph which contains the organ of hearing known as the spiral organ of Corti. The spiral organ of Corti contains groups of approximately 100 hair cells arranged in rows and supported by pillar-like cells and the vibrations detected by these cells are converted into signals by the vestibulocochlear nerve and transmitted to the brain. The frequencies at which these cells are stimulated depends upon their position within the cochlea. As you can see from the scanning electron microscope images below, this is a complex and exquisitely organised system. <br /><br />The middle ear contains air and communicates with the throat via the Eustachian tube or auditory canal. At rest this tube is collapsed to prevent the ingress of bacteria from the nose and mouth, but four small muscles open the tube when you swallow or yawn allowing pressures to equalise and the middle ear secretions to drain. A functional and patent Eustachian tube is necessary for the mechanics of both hearing and balance. <br /><br />The tubular tonsils guard the pharyngeal end of the Eustachian tube and these form part of the ring of lymphoid tissue in the nasopharynx known as Waldeyer’s Ring. Enlargement of the tubular tonsils or of the adjacent pharyngeal tonsils (also known as adenoids) can cause blockage of the auditory canal. Animal experiments have shown that the inner and middle ear are independently connected to the lymphatic drainage system. <br /><br />In relation to balance, there are three semicircular canals organised in different planes of space that again have a fluid filled membranous structure encased within a bony cavity. These canals known as the vestibular apparatus and the cochlea are continuous and meet in a central chamber known as the vestibule. <br /><br />These canals are lined with groups of sensory hair-like cells that are attached to otoliths or little stones. As the stones and fluid move the hairs are stimulated and send information about 3 dimensional position and movement in space to the brain. <br /><br />This information is coordinated by the brain with proprioceptive feedback from the joints and muscles (which gives information about the relative position of body parts to one another) and to vision to coordinate balance and movement. In total, six neurotransmitters are involved in generating and transmitting the signals produced by the organs of balance and hearing. <br /><br />Ear problems<br />Otitis media<br />Otitis media or inflammation of the middle ear is the most common diagnosis in sick children in the developed world. It involves ear pain which may be accompanied by fever, a feeling of fullness in the ears, temporary hearing loss and distress.<br /><br />Infection, allergy, toxicity or inflammation from any source causes lymphatic fluid to build-up in the middle ear. Enlargement of either the tubular tonsils or the adenoids may block the Eustachian tube. Food intolerances and particularly the consumption of dairy products are considered to be a prime suspect as they are known to induce mucus membrane inflammation and mucus production in many people.<br /><br />Hearing loss<br /><br />Hearing loss can be caused by a variety of toxins (see below), infections including measles, mumps, and meningitis, physical trauma, central nervous system disorders (such as tumours) and exposure to loud noises.<br /><br />Individuals with a history of head injury are particularly vulnerable to later hearing loss or tinnitus which may be temporary or permanent. An example is King Jordan who lost his hearing as a result of sustaining a skull fracture in a motorcycle accident when he was 21 years old.<br /><br />Tinnitus<br />Tinnitus is the perception of ringing or whining tones within the ear. It can be genetic or caused by exposure to loud noises, infections, allergies, and some medications particularly benzodiazepine withdrawal.<br /><br />It can vary in intensity from occasional and mild to continuous and loud disrupting sleep and normal activity. It is very common with one in five people between the ages of 55 and 65 reporting some symptoms of tinnitus. <br /><br />Vertigo<br />Vertigo is the sensation of motion while being stationary that induces dizziness. It may be associated with other symptoms such as vomiting, blurred vision, hearing loss, difficulty speaking, standing or walking, and a lowered level of consciousness. In particular the eyes may jerk rapidly in attacks of what is known as nystagmus. <br /><br />Episodes of vertigo may last anywhere from a few moments to a few days or may become permanent. Sufferers often need to sit or lie still during an attack, but the sensation of movement may continue even though they are not moving at all. <br /><br />Inflammation and infections including the common cold and influenza can cause transient vertigo, as may exposure to toxins and physical trauma (eg: skull fractures). Vertigo can also be due to disorders of the auditory nerve, brain or brain stem. Sometimes collections of the otoliths in particular locations can cause positional vertigo when the head is moved in particular ways especially in older people. <br /><br />Ménière's disease<br />Ménière's disease affects about 2 people per 1,000 and involves sudden, episodic attacks of vertigo which may be accompanied by noise in the ears (tinnitus), progressive hearing loss (usually lower frequencies and in one ear), a sense of fullness or pressure in the affected ear, nystagmus and severe nausea and vomiting. Sometimes sounds can be tiny or distorted and sufferers may become unusually sensitive to sounds. <br /><br />Attacks can last from minutes to hours. Sudden, severe attacks known as 'drop attacks' can cause the person to fall. Ménière's disease can range in intensity from being a mild annoyance to being a total, lifelong disability.  <br /><br />Critically, individuals suffering with other conditions including some autoimmune diseases, dysautonomia (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system), multiple sclerosis (MS), thyroid disorders and migraines may present with Ménière's-like symptoms - many of which are probably caused by the same underlying toxicity (see below). Like the autoimmune diseases, CFS and fibromyalgia, Ménière's disease tends to affect more women than men and onset is typically in adulthood with prevalence increasing with age.<br /><br />The consumption of salt, alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco, can all aggravate symptoms of Ménière's. Allergies may also play a causative role. <br /><br />Medical approaches include giving drugs for the nausea and vomiting, using cyclizine patches worn behind the ear to alleviate symptoms, and benzodiazepines for the anxiety induced by the unexpected attacks. The drugs used all have side-effects, especially in older people and should be avoided if at all possible. <br /><br />Surgery is recognised to compromise hearing and some treatments aim to chemically destroy or surgically remove the vestibular apparatus or to sever the nerves. Even then, recovery is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting as the brain learns to compensate. <br /><br />Causes of ear damage<br /><br />Toxic causes of ear damage<br /><br />Hearing loss due to exposure to toxic chemicals tends to start in the high frequency range as toxins create areas of damage within the cochlea and also degrade central portions of the auditory system. Ototoxic substances known to cause balance or hearing problems include:  <br /><br />Solvents such as toluene which is used in gasoline, paint thinners and removers, and correction fluid<br />Other solvents including styrene, xylene, p-xylene, n-hexane, ethyl benzene, white spirits, carbon disulphide, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene<br />Asphyxiants including carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide<br />Toxic metals including lead, mercury, and organotins (trimethyltin)<br />Pesticides and herbicides including paraquat, and organophosphates and<br />The artificial sweetener, aspartame. <br /><br />Exposure to these toxins has an additive effect along with exposure to noise.<br /><br />Pharmaceutical causes of ear damage<br />This issue first came to light when tuberculosis patients were given the newly developed antibiotic, streptomycin in 1944 and many subsequently developed irreversible hearing loss. The later development of other aminoglycoside antibiotics led to a great deal of research into the mechanisms of ototoxicity. <br /><br />Over 100 classes of drugs have now been associated with causing toxic damage to the structures of ear or the associated brain centres leading to hearing and balance problems, and tinnitus. The following drugs have all been shown to be ototoxic: <br /><br />Aminoglycoside antibiotics including gentamicin<br />Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin<br />Anti-angina nitrate drugs may cause immediate balance or hearing problems<br />The chemotherapy drug cisplatin<br />Various antihypertensive drugs <br />The sedative phenobarbital<br />The anticonvulsant phenytoin<br />The antipsychotic chlorpromazine <br />Antimalarial drugs including quinine<br />Certain diuretics including furosemide and<br />No surprises - excessive consumption of alcohol can also cause temporary vertigo.<br /><br />Rush Limbaugh, the American radio talk show host was diagnosed with an autoimmune inner ear disease and within three months lost all his hearing. He has subsequently had a cochlea implant fitted and now has some measure of hearing. Some have speculated that his hearing loss was due to his admitted addiction to narcotic pain killers, in particular Vicodin and OxyContin.<br /><br />Dental causes of ear damage<br />There are several ways in which dental procedures in general and dental restorations in particular may cause problems with hearing or balance. Many dentists especially in Germany, Scandinavia and Denmark have documented improvements in balance and hearing loss after the safe removal of amalgam fillings (Mat Hanson, M. Daunderer, D.K. Lichtenberg, R.L. Sibelrud, D. Melchart, and Dr. Harald Hamre, and the Marburg study).<br /><br />Mercury toxicity &amp; ear problems<br />The majority of the mercury vapour given off by dental amalgam fillings is inhaled into the lungs from where it passes in the blood to the rest of the body. Being highly lipophilic (fat-loving) and neurophilic the mercury is absorbed into the nerve endings particularly of the autonomic nervous system (the automatic system that governs functions below conscious awareness). <br /><br />It then travels up the autonomic nerves to the central nervous system in a process known as retrograde axonal transport disrupting function and eventually causing death of the neurons involved. Some of the mercury vapour emitted by amalgam fillings is absorbed directly into the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx and sinuses where it may directly disrupt function (eg: of the tonsils). <br /><br />Mercury poisoning is recognised to cause hearing loss, deafness, vertigo, tinnitus and also to change perception of sound so that the individual's ability to understand what they hear is diminished. They may also experience sharp pricking pains in their ear canals.<br /><br />Mercury rapidly damages the organs of excretion - the liver and kidneys - and so the cargo of mercury is stored in body tissues. More mercury may be launched into the system as a result of a variety of factors including exposure to electromagnetic fields, dental work, chewing, grinding teeth, and drinking or eating hot or acidic foods. <br /><br />Mercury also seems to be moved from organ system to organ system according to factors including stress, the nutrients available, the time of day, in/adequate sleep and rest, etc.  <br /><br />Being fat soluble, mercury accumulates in the lymph and may well concentrate in the perilymph and endolymph of the inner ear. From there absorption into the sensory cells of the organ of Corti or balance may cause destruction as shown in the images below. <br /><br />Ultimately this destruction may cause progressive degeneration of the vestibulocochlear nerve or the parts of the brain responsible for processing aural information. Mercury accumulating in the lymph of the ear may also disable the tubular tonsil so that lymph backs up within the ear becoming toxic.  <br /><br />Mercury also disrupts the biochemistry of the neurotransmitters and given that there are 6 different neurotransmitters involved in the process of hearing there is plenty of opportunity for blockade of one or more neurotransmitters thus disrupting nerve signals. <br /><br />Many people presenting with Ménière's-type symptoms also have disorders known to be associated with mercury poisoning including 'autoimmune' diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS), thyroid disorders and migraines which may all be caused by the same underlying toxicity. As may the nystagmus which also often occurs during an attack. <br /><br />And the greater prevalence of Ménière's in women and onset in midlife also ties in with the fact that women are more vulnerable to mercury toxicity. Added to which Ménière's disease was first diagnosed in the 1860s - just a few decades after the introduction of dental amalgam.<br /><br />Galvanic currents from dental restorations &amp; ear problems<br /><br />The conductor of the Boston Philharmonic, Dr Benjamin Zander, recently gave testimony to the FDA hearings into the safety of dental amalgam. <br /><br />He stated that 7 years previously he had developed Ménière's disease, which had caused violent bouts of vomiting, vertigo and massive hearing loss. Because of the violence of these attacks, he had had to cancel or stop in the middle of several performances and visits to Ear, Nose and Throat specialists throughout the world had yielded no results. <br /><br />Eventually, the Paracelsus clinic in Switzerland suggested he have all his metal dental restorations removed as a result of which he describes his recovery as 'extraordinary'. All symptoms of the Ménière's disease suddenly disappeared and have not reappeared in the intervening 7 years.<br /><br />Since the improvement appears to have been fairly immediate and he makes no mention of any extensive detoxification, his symptoms may well have been a result of the galvanic currents created within the moisture of the mouth by the various metals and he specifically mentions amalgam fillings and nickel-containing crowns. <br /><br />The electromagnetic currents generated by the different metals used in the mouth can be 1,000X those in the brain and ear which are just centimetres away and which may disrupt either the generation or transmission of the nerve impulses. <br /><br />Dental restorations disrupt meridian flows<br />All the energy meridians pass through the teeth and any metal restorations may block these flows. Removal of such restorations may also result in immediate improvements in many kinds of conditions.<br /><br />Also, according to the dictates of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the Kidney meridian 'opens into the ear' so that tinnitus and other symptoms may be a sign of kidney stress. In animal experiments by Murray Vimy et al at the University of Calgary, the mercury from dental amalgam fillings has been shown to compromise kidney function by 50% within a month of placement of the first filling. So the kidneys are known to be under enormous stress in individuals with amalgam fillings. Removal of toxic metal restorations may enable the kidneys to repair and restore thus alleviating the associated ear symptoms. <br /><br />The muscles of the body all relate to the meridians and effectively act as safety valves for the function of the internal organ systems. Such that muscles become weak or hypertonic (tense) depending upon the status of the associated meridian. The relationships of at least 42 of the bilateral muscles to the meridians was established by the founder of Kinesiology, Dr George Goodheart some 40 years ago. Doubtless the tiny muscles governing the drainage and functioning of the ear may have relationships to energy meridians which to the best of my knowledge have yet to be established. <br /><br />Temperomandibular joint dysfunction &amp; ear problems<br />Although temperomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJD) is regarded as being the province of dentists, the function of this joint may be related to, or may be the cause of, balance or hearing problems. Half the motor cortex of the brain is devoted to the TMJ, so the body regards this joint as being very important for reasons that aren't entirely clear. <br /><br />TMJ problems are a common finding in the fatigue syndromes caused by mercury toxicity and almost all dental procedures have the potential to alter the bite causing TMj problems which may affect the functioning of the ear.  <br /><br />As a veteran of detoxifying mercury, I can tell you that a prickling sensation in the hands and tinnitus are some of the more reliable signs that mercury is being mobilised from storage and excreted. I have also experienced episodes of hearing loss and vertigo related to detoxifying mercury. <br /><br />For more information, refer to the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a>]natural recovery plan website[/url].

It is a mixture of 50% liquid mercury and 50% powdered metals and it never truly sets, instead becoming a stiff paste of alloys in a liquid mercury base. <br /><br />These different metals combine to create a battery in the moisture of the mouth and when these fillings discharge their electrical current, the liquid mercury within the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam filling[/url] is vaporised.  <br /><br />Although the authorities impose strict rules about the handling of amalgam before and after placement, and even relating to cremation of cadavers, they still maintain that the mouth of a human being is a safe place for this material - in spite of never having produced one scientific paper to demonstrate their claim. <br /><br />Mercury truly acts like the proverbial spanner in the works in the body, disrupting biological function on a number of different levels. The following is not exhaustive, but presents a list of some 150 recognised symptoms of mercury toxicity. <br /><br />The respiratory system <br />Up to 80% of inhaled mercury vapour is absorbed through the lungs. From here it travels to all the other tissues and organs of the body in the circulation, but particularly concentrates within the kidney, liver and brain. <br /><br />The presence of mercury in the lungs causes chronic breathing disorders including: <br /><br />Asthma <br />Bronchitis <br />Breathlessness <br />Persistent cough and<br />Bad breath<br /><br />Compromised cognitive function<br />Mercury is both highly neurophilic (which means that it binds tightly to nerves) and highly lipophilic (which means that it binds tightly to fats). When distributed around the body in the circulation it is absorbed into the nerve endings that regulate all the functions of the body (the autonomic nervous system). From there it slowly tracks up the nerves into the central nervous system, in what is known as retrograde axonal transport. <br /><br />It prevents nerves regenerating by disrupting the protein tubulin, disrupts nerve function and also attacks the insulating myelin sheaths surrounding some nerves. <br /><br />Mercury from amalgam easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and can damage any part of the central nervous system including the master endocrine glands at the base of the brain which control both the nervous and endocrine systems. <br /><br />The levels of mercury in the brain have been shown to be directly related to the number of amalgam fillings in the mouth. Whilst mercury is highly detrimental on its own, its destructive power can be increased 100 fold by exposure to other toxic metals such as aluminium, lead or cadmium. <br /><br />Mercury can produce a host of mental, emotional, and behavioural changes and what are considered 'psychiatric' disorders by disrupting neurotransmitters, interfering with endocrine gland function and hormones and causing destruction of nervous pathways.<br /><br />The effects of mercury on cognitive function include:<br /><br />Poor memory <br />Difficulty multitasking<br />Difficulty finding words <br />A lack of initiative <br />An inability to concentrate <br />An inability to make decisions and <br />Lack of motivation<br /><br />Changes in mood<br />Mercury is also known to have profound effects upon mood including:<br /><br />Fears <br />Anxieties<br />Irritability<br />Fits of anger<br />Panic attacks<br />Mood swings<br />Loss of self-confidence<br />Withdrawal<br />Being easily embarrassed<br />Feeling overwhelmed<br />Feeling easily discouraged<br />A loss of sense of humour and<br />Life seems an endless, joyless struggle<br /><br />'Psychiatric' symptoms<br />The ability of mercury to induce 'mercury madness' is well recognised and symptoms include:<br /><br />Hallucinations<br />Depression<br />A persistent death wish<br />Suicide attempts<br />Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders<br />Manic-Depressive Disorder<br />Panic disorders and<br />Schizophrenia spectrum disorders<br /><br />Peripheral nervous system symptoms<br />The profound disruption of nerve structure and function leads to difficulty with motor nerve function including: <br /><br />Difficulty articulating words<br />Numbness and tingling<br />Clumsiness<br />Difficulty doing fine tasks such as typing or adding numbers on a calculator<br />Tremors<br />Ticks and twitches (especially of the face and eyes)<br />A loss of coordination and <br />Restless legs<br /><br />Reproductive and sexual function<br />Mercury is also recognised to collect in the reproductive organs in both men and women where it can cause a variety of disorders including infertility. <br /><br />It is known to directly cross the placental barrier in pregnant women and also to concentrate in breast milk and mercury levels in newborn babies have been shown to be directly related to the number of amalgam fillings in the mother’s mouth.  <br /><br />The symptoms of mercury toxicity in both sexes include: <br /><br />A low or non-existent libido<br />Precocious or late puberty and<br />Infertility <br /><br />In women, the effects of mercury on reproductive function include: <br /><br />Heavy, missed or irregular periods <br />Severe period pains<br />Pre-menstrual tension (PMT)  <br />Miscarriages and<br />Still births<br /><br />In men, mercury accumulates in the reproductive organs and particularly the testes causing: <br /><br />Impotence<br />Premature ejaculation and<br />Low sperm count, defective sperm and sperm with poor motility<br /><br />The urinary system<br />Mercury from dental amalgam fillings is also recognised to severely impact kidney function such that animal studies have shown a 50% reduction within a month of placement of the first amalgam filling. <br /><br />Effects of mercury on the urinary system include:<br /><br />Kidney damage<br />Frequent urination<br />Frequent nocturnal urination (2-3 times a night or more)<br />Incontinence (especially in women)<br />Difficulty urinating (especially in men)<br />An urgent need to urinate and<br />A variety of kidney and bladder diseases.<br /><br />The musculoskeletal system<br />Mercury also accumulates throughout the body in muscles and joints causing the muscle tenderness and pain familiar to fibromyalgia sufferers and the joint pain, stiffness and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis. <br /><br />The symptoms of mercury toxicity on the musculoskeletal system include:<br /><br />Tender, sore muscles<br />Rapid muscle fatigue <br />Joint pain<br />Joint swelling<br />Joint stiffness<br />Muscle cramps<br />Low-back pain<br />Muscle weakness and<br />Jaw joint or Tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction (TMJD)<br /><br />The cardiovascular system<br />In particular, mercury seems to collect in the heart muscle and valves and has been found at 22,000X the levels found in the blood. Mercury is strongly associated with elevated levels of homocysteine and cholesterol and heart attacks.<br /><br />It also causes red blood cells to rupture and replaces the iron in haemoglobin so that the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood can be reduced by half. Mercury also causes a weakening in the walls of the small blood vessels leading to a reduced blood supply to the organs and tissues. <br /><br />The cardiovascular symptoms of mercury poisoning include:  <br /><br />Heart palpitations<br />An irregular heart beat<br />Angina or chest pain<br />A racing heart beat <br />Either an abnormally slow or rapid heart rate <br />Low or high blood pressure<br />Frequently feeling faint <br />Elevated blood cholesterol and homocysteine levels and <br />Easy bleeding and bruising.<br /><br />The endocrine system<br />Mercury disrupts hormone production and release from the endocrine glands, and also blocks the receptors which allow the hormones to dock on to the target cells in the tissues. <br /><br />The endocrine system has a high requirement for specific trace minerals and accumulation of mercury within the glands may occur because of the chemical similarity to the essential mineral, zinc.<br /><br />Symptoms of mercury poisoning in the endocrine system include: <br /><br />Hypoglycaemia and dysglycaemia (low and poorly controlled blood sugar respectively)<br />Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland)<br />Hypoadrenalism (under-functioning adrenal glands)<br />Constant fatigue (adrenal and thyroid gland exhaustion) and<br />A poor physiological response to stress.  <br /><br />The oral cavity<br />Mercury also collects in very high concentrations in the jaw bones and the soft tissues of the mouth. This is a result of it being a heavy metal that literally sinks to the bottom of each body compartment including the jaws and pelvis and the fact that mercury is driven into the tissues of the mouth which act as a cathode to the anode of the amalgam fillings. <br /><br />Mixing gold and amalgam restorations in the mouth is also recognised to increase the amount of mercury vapour given off several fold and placing gold crowns over amalgam cores particularly drives mercury into the surrounding bone. <br /><br />Symptoms of mercury toxicity in the mouth include: <br /><br />Bleeding gums<br />Periodontal (gum) disease<br />Mouth ulcers<br />A metallic taste<br />Excessive salivation<br />A loss of the sense of taste <br />A burning, red, inflamed mouth <br />‘Bald’ patches on the tongue or cheeks (includes geographical tongue) and<br />Dark spots on gums ('amalgam tattoos')<br /><br />The ears: Hearing and balance <br />Mercury also seems to collect in the many sensory nerves of the ear that serve hearing and balance. Symptoms include:<br /><br />Dizziness<br />Vertigo<br />Poor balance<br />Tinnitus (ringing or whining noises in the ears)<br />Pain in the ear canals <br />Poor hearing and deafness and<br />Difficulty interpreting what you hear.<br /><br />Skin, hair and nails<br />For the body, the skin is a major route of excretion and it will try to expel mercury via the skin<br /><br />leading to itchy rashes, and dry, flaking skin. It can also strange crawling sensations and reddening of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. <br /><br />It also seems to interfere with the regulation of perspiration so that some people become unable to sweat while others sweat profusely. <br /><br />Cold, clammy skin<br />Dry skin<br />Peeling or flaking skin on the hands, feet and face<br />A puffy face<br />Red, flaky skin around the eyes <br />Thick, red skin on hands &amp; feet <br />Pricking, stabbing, fizzing or crawling sensations in the skin (vermiculation)<br />Very itchy rashes<br />Eczema and psoriasis.<br /><br />Mercury also seems to interfere with the autonomic control of perspiration causing:<br /><br />Excessive perspiration<br />An inability to sweat or<br />Night sweats.<br /><br />The quality of the hair and nails is also adversely affected causing: <br /><br />Loss of axillary, pubic, body or head hair <br />Greying of hair<br />Dry, thin, wiry, dull hair and<br />Weak, flaky nails that split and tear easily.<br /><br />The nose and sinuses <br />Some of the mercury vapour from amalgam fillings adheres to the lining of the nose and sinuses from where it can be transported directly into the brain and cause the following symptoms:<br /><br />Chronic sinusitis<br />Poor sense of smell<br />Chronic or recurrent rhinitis<br />Nasal congestion<br />A persistently sore throat and <br />Chronic tonsillitis.<br /><br />Eyesight <br />Mercury appears to collect within the eye balls themselves leading to the appearance of 'floaters' (dark cloudy areas), but also adversely affects the muscles controlling focussing of the eyes and lens and the sensory nerves of the retina itself leading to: <br /><br />Intermittent visual blurring<br />Deteriorating peripheral vision or 'tunnel' vision<br />Bulging eyes<br />Sensitivity to light<br />Difficulty focussing<br />Poor colour vision <br />Poor night vision and<br />Difficulty moving the eyes. <br /><br />The digestive system <br />Much of the mercury from dental amalgams is swallowed along with foods or in the saliva and the digestive system is usually one of the first to be affected. Mercury binds with and blocks the actions of digestive enzymes leading to poor digestion and the development of food intolerances. <br /><br />It also alters the normal ecology of the colon, favouring the overgrowth of yeasts (most commonly Candida albicans) and suppressing the growth of 'friendly' bacteria which can lead to the development of intestinal permeability or a so called 'leaky gut'. Digestive symptoms of mercury poisoning include:<br /><br />The development of food sensitivities and intolerances<br />Abdominal cramps and pain<br />Constipation and/or diarrhoea<br />Irritable bowel syndrome<br />Malabsorption<br />Leaky gut<br />Gastroenteritis<br />Nausea and<br />Heartburn.<br /><br />The immune system<br />The immune system is one of the first casualties of mercury toxicity. It causes a reduction in the number of natural killer (NK) cells which are responsible for policing tumours and viruses leading to the development of chronic viral infections and cancer. <br /><br />The effects of mercury toxicity upon the immune system include:  <br /><br />Chronic, recurrent or frequent infections.<br />Chronic or recurrent yeast infections. Mercury actively promotes the overgrowth of yeasts such as Candida albicans causing thrush, 'jock' itch and athlete’s foot.<br />The development of allergies and sensitivities. Mercury alters the ratios of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells so that the immune response is turned on more readily but not terminated, leading the immune system to over-react to a wide variety of foods and chemicals.  <br />Autoimmune diseases. Mercury binds to proteins on the surface of the cells of the body (the histocompatibility complex), leading the immune system to identify them as being foreign and initiating one of the 100 or more autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, scleroderma or Hashimoto thyroiditis.<br />Various cancers. The undermining of the immune response and in particular the disabling of the natural killer cells leads to the development of one of the most prevalent immune deficiency disease of all: cancer. <br /><br />The lymphatic system works to drain and filter excess fluid from the tissues and to initiate an immune response if required. The effects of mercury toxicity on the lymphatic system include: <br /><br />Water retention (especially of the legs) and <br />Swollen lymph nodes (especially in the neck). <br /><br />General symptoms of mercury toxicity<br />Last, but not least, mercury particularly accumulates in the mitochondria ('powerhouses') of the cells where it poisons energy production. The presence of mercury in the circulation and the effects on energy production lead to:<br /><br />A profound exhaustion and fatigue (chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia)<br />Low body temperature <br />Cold hands and feet<br />Unexplained changes in weight <br />Changes in appetite<br />Excessive thirst <br />Headaches and migraines<br />Anaemia<br />Difficulty getting to sleep<br />Early waking<br />Insomnia and<br />Sleepiness during the day<br /><br />Illnesses associated with mercury poisoning<br />There are a wide range of illnesses that have been linked with mercury poisoning including:<br /><br />Fibromyalgia<br />Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)<br />Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)<br />Multiple sclerosis (MS)<br />Parkinson's disease<br />Alzheimer's disease (AD) <br />Colitis <br />Crohn's disease<br />Autoimmune diseases <br />Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <br />Autism and<br />Cancer.<br /><br />Check out more info from the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a>]natural recovery plan[/url].

The findings were published in a 57 page report entitled Future Use of Materials for Dental Restoration in 2010, a summary of which is provided at the end of this article.<br /><br />But first, in order to understand the implications of the report for the future of dentistry, it is important to look back and understand where we are and how we got here. I know that I spent a total of seven years training at two of the best dental schools in the world, actually doing a Master’s degree in Restorative Dentistry at the University of Michigan and the subject of the toxicity of amalgam was never mentioned other than to be summarily dismissed! <br /><br />Amalgam: The first 200 years<br />Dental amalgam was first created nearly 2 centuries ago by a Frenchman, August Taveau, who shaved silver coins and mixed the filings with mercury causing &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url]. Two French brothers - the Crawcours - first brought this innovation to England and then to America when they emigrated there in 1833. <br /><br />At the time there were no dental schools and there were two groups of people providing dental services. One were unregulated and untrained tradesmen and particularly barbers who had the advantage of having reclining chairs, and the other group were gentleman physician-surgeons.<br /><br />Things, frankly, weren’t fantastic when the Crawcour brothers began peddling their new filling material under the grand title of Royal Mineral Succedaneum since lead, cork, tin and pine resin were all being used as filling materials for the masses along with gold for the wealthy. <br /><br />The dangers of mercury as particularly evidenced in the hatting and mining industries were already well known at the time. And the first dental society, the American Society of Dental Surgeons (ASDS), was founded in 1840 on the basis of the physician-surgeons taking a stance against the use of amalgam which it regarded as being unethical. <br /><br />However, the untrained and unregulated barber surgeons continued to cash in on the craze, and soon membership of the ASDS dwindled as physician members jumped ship until the society was disbanded just 16 years after its foundation. In fact, the derogatory term 'quack' (from quecksilber, the German word for mercury) was originally coined by the physicians to refer to the tradesmen who used amalgam fillings. <br /><br />From the void created by the dissolution of the ASDS arose, phoenix-like, the American Dental Association (ADA) which was founded in 1859 and actively promoted the use of amalgam and for which it currently owns the patents (U.S. Patents 4018600 and 4078921). <br /><br />This fracas was the ‘First Amalgam War’ and you have to ask yourself how it can be considered unethical to remove something today which it was unethical to place 180 years ago.<br /><br />The &quot;We've done it for a long time&quot; argument<br />From its introduction to the present day, amalgam has never been subjected to any meaningful toxicological testing and has been 'grandfathered in' to the profession. One of the main and rather circular arguments used to defend this state of affairs by the ADA is that the safety of amalgam should not be disputed precisely because it has been in use for over 150 years. <br /><br />However, the fact that we have been doing something plainly as inadvisable as inserting the third most toxic and second most deadly substance known to man into cavities in people's teeth for nearly two centuries doesn’t make it right. Take, for example, slavery and bloodletting. <br /><br />The human slave trade in one form or another has dogged the history of mankind for millennia (and still does with an estimated 27 million slaves worldwide) and some of the good people of the US resisted that change so vociferously they went to war with their brothers over it.  <br /><br />The theory of the four humors as propounded by the Ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates, became the central tenet of medical practice for over two thousand years. As such, bloodletting was the most common practice used to treat or prevent almost every disease and was still being recommended in respected medical textbooks as recently as 1923!<br /><br />We have done a lot of foolhardy things when we didn't know any better. We used asbestos in buildings, x-rayed children’s feet in shoe shops, and used DDT with abandon. Now, with the wisdom of hindsight we ask with incredulity &quot;What were we thinking?&quot; <br /><br />The health effects of amalgam use<br />In 1974 the World Health Organisation stated that heavy metal toxicity was a major source of world disease and also determined in 1991 that the lion's share of mercury exposure (65-90%) for most people comes from their dental amalgam fillings. <br /><br />Mercury is unique in being a liquid metal that vaporises at room temperature. When mixed with the other toxic metals used in dental amalgam the fillings become galvanically active and this promotes the release of about 32 mcg of mercury vapour per filling per day. <br /><br />This vapour is inhaled and approximately 80% is absorbed in the lungs from where it readily passes into the circulation and to the rest of the body. From there (depending upon a variety of factors) it can accumulate in any organ or system initiating or worsening a wide range of illnesses. <br /><br />There is a delay of many months or even years in the appearance of symptoms known as 'silent latency' and this and the sheer number of different biochemical and neurological manifestations have confounded making the causative link.<br /><br />The average filling contains 1 gm of mercury (about the same amount as in a thermometer) which is enough to contaminate a 20 acre lake to the point where warnings not to eat any fish caught would be issued. And it is well established that just 50% of the original mercury content of the amalgam filling remains after 7 years and just 20% after 20 years. <br /><br />The harm that mercury does is cumulative and it is said to take just one atom of mercury to kill a cell. With the average filling emitting more atoms of mercury (120 trillion) per day than there are cells in the body, you may start to appreciate the effects of having an average number of amalgam fillings over a period of years or decades. <br /><br />To make a bad situation a whole lot worse, high copper or non-gamma II amalgam was universally introduced in the 1970s and was supposed to overcome the problem with amalgam fillings expanding and cracking and breaking teeth. There is evidence to suggest that this amalgam - which contains 30 percent copper in the alloy powder - was known to form droplets of mercury on its surface when it was introduced. <br /><br />Droplets of mercury on the surface of high copper amalgam <br /><br />This means that for the last 40 years the profession has been using amalgam that has been shown to emit 50 times the mercury vapour of the previous formulation - in addition to emitting large amounts of highly toxic copper. This one factor I believe may account for the stratospheric increase in chronic and serious illnesses including the ‘mysterious’, autoimmune and fatiguing syndromes such as CFS and fibromyalgia in recent decades.<br /><br />In addition, placing any other metals in the mouth - particularly gold crowns and especially if placed over an amalgam 'core' - has been shown to compound the problem of mercury emission by a factor of 20 or more. <br /><br />Recent studies have established that amalgam isn't any better than the alternatives - it's just what everyone is familiar with. I know that in my private practice, probably half of my work load related to teeth that had cracked or fractured as a result of amalgam fillings placed decades previously. Indeed, I have been a victim of this myself having had no fewer than 7 molar teeth crack and devitalise from mostly modest sized occlusal amalgam fillings.<br /><br />The environmental effects of amalgam use<br />In addition to the devastating health effects of mercury toxicity upon the individual, the use of amalgam by the dental profession is a major source of environmental mercury. This is an issue because even small amounts of elemental mercury are converted by algae and microbes in the soil and waterways into organic mercury which is at least 100 times more toxic. This form is also very persistent and bioconcentrates and bioaccumulates up the food chain devastating our ocean ecosystems. <br /><br />In the UK alone, over 7 tonnes of mercury from dental amalgam waste are discharged every year into the environment in one form or another, with a further 12 tonnes per annum being sent for recycling or disposed of as clinical waste. The WHO report estimates that globally dentistry may be responsible for releasing up to 340 tonnes of mercury into the environment annually. <br /><br />The use of dental amalgam is thought to account for about one-third of the mercury in the sewage system from dental surgery waste and the combined medical and dental uses of mercury account for over half of the total mercury environmental contamination.<br /><br />Indirect means by which the use of amalgam contributes to the total amount of environmental mercury include the fact that individuals with amalgam restorations excrete mercury daily in their bodily wastes over a lifetime. Also, when we reach the end of our earthly sojourn the mercury in our fillings and that has accumulated in our bodies is either vaporised into the environment in a crematorium or, if we are buried, leaches into the ground water and soil.<br /><br />The current status of amalgam in the US<br />There is no question that the position the U.S. takes on this issue, as stated in the Council of Europe's report on the topic is “likely to change the global debate on amalgams.” So it is instructive to understand what is happening Stateside. <br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a large government agency charged with &quot;protecting and promoting&quot; the health of American citizens. Amalgam first came under the jurisdiction of the FDA in 1976 when it was classified as a device (ie: not subject to toxicological or safety testing). <br /><br />Many considered that the FDA was not doing its job when it came to the safety of amalgam and, after a ten year legal battle by campaign groups, it was forced to comply with a court ruling in June 2008. The judgement was that the FDA was required to replace statements about amalgam being 'safe' on their website with the warning that amalgam &quot;.. may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and foetuses&quot; and to agree to reclassify amalgam by the end of 2011 following a period of public comment. <br /><br />The FDA subsequently complied with the judgement for a few months before removing the entire webpage at issue along with another Q and A page about the safety of amalgam in direct violation of the ruling (which would be deemed contempt of court subject to a prison term if the ruling had related to an individual).  <br /><br />They then convened a panel in July 2009 to investigate the issue of amalgam safety giving interested parties just 2 working days notice to make representations. Some FDA insiders were so alarmed by these and other tactics that  they wrote an open letter to the Obama administration warning that &quot;The scientific review process for medical devices at the FDA has been corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers&quot;.<br /><br />In the FDA's Final Regulation on Amalgam, the panel upgraded the classification of amalgam from Class 1 (low risk) to Class II (moderate risk). It also requires a benefit and risk statement to be included with amalgam, along with advice against its use in patients with mercury allergy, and a warning stressing the importance of adequate ventilation when handling dental amalgam. <br /><br />According to Dr Boyd Haley, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry from the University of Kentucky, the FDA spokesperson that he and others made representations to said &quot;You're preaching to the choir. Everyone at the FDA knows mercury comes out of amalgam and that it is toxic.&quot; <br /><br />However, the FDA appears to be standing shoulder to shoulder with the dentist's trade organisation, the American Dental Association (ADA), which continues to &quot;assure the American people that dental amalgam is safe&quot; and to insist that the replacing of amalgam fillings in non-allergic patients is &quot;improper and unethical&quot;. The ADA describe the convening of the FDA panel on their website as being &quot;costly and redundant&quot;. <br /><br />Perhaps louder than its words are the actions of the ADA which has deleted reassuring statements about the safety of amalgam from its website. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has also deleted an entire webpage refuting amalgam as a cause of illness.<br /><br />Within the last year or so, three Californian cities have banned amalgam and several States including Maine, California, Connecticut, and Vermont now require dentists to discuss the potential health risks of amalgam with their patients under Informed Consent Legislation. <br /><br />The current status of amalgam use in Europe<br />The European Academy for Environmental Medicine (EUROPAEM) along with other action groups in 2007 declared and signed what became known as the 'Luxembourg Appeal' on the use of amalgam which was designed to exert political pressure on European Union and national health authorities in Europe.<br /><br />In Germany, Max Daunderer, who is the Director of the Tox Center in Grünwald, and former Professor of Toxicology at the University of Munich, and who literally wrote the book on the toxicity of amalgam (22,000 pages and 3 volumes) has made repeated representations to the German government based upon 25,000 documented cases of proven harm. In March 2008, frustrated by governmental inaction he indicted the Federal Republic of Germany to the European Court of Human Rights for violations of the “Right to life and physical integrity”.<br /><br />In recognition of the health threat to dental professionals, their patients and their unborn children, and the environmental issues posed by the use of dental amalgam, several European countries have now introduced phasing-out or phasing-down policies including the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, and Austria.<br /><br />Sweden, Denmark, and Norway having completed a phase-out period have now introduced complete amalgam bans. And Sweden has eliminated the use of mercury from all healthcare and their remaining mercury contaminated waste and supplies are in 'terminal storage' in caves deep underground. <br /><br />In May 2011, the 47 nations of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe passed a resolution calling for all member nations to start &quot;restricting or prohibiting the use of amalgams as dental fillings&quot;.  <br /><br />Elsewhere, the Arab League and the African Region have also announced that they support the phase-out of amalgam and the promotion of alternatives. And other countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy and the UK have recommended avoiding the use of amalgam in pregnant women, nursing mothers, children, and people with kidney disease and so are effectively on the first rung of a phase-down. Although not restricted, use of amalgam in many Asian and Eastern European countries has dramatically decreased in recent years as both dentists and patients have favoured alternative filling materials. <br /><br />The WHO Report findings<br />The WHO report acknowledges the health and environmental concerns about the use of amalgam and, after considering the impact of any changes on developing nations and the underprivileged in high income countries, calls for a worldwide phase-down of the use of dental amalgam and a switch to the use of alternative dental materials. It appears that it is only in recognition of the huge logistical global challenges faced that the WHO panel came out in favour of a phase-down of the use of amalgam as a restorative material rather than a phase-out.<br /><br />In addition, the report recommends that:<br /><br />A treaty on the use of mercury in dentistry be prepared.<br />Alternative materials be used to restore the deciduous teeth of children who are especially vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of dental mercury.<br />A global registry be set up in order to collect and evaluate data about the adverse health effects of dental material related symptoms and diseases in various populations.<br />Research be conducted to identify special risk groups and individuals who might be highly sensitive to various restorative materials.<br />Research into improving existing filling materials and developing new alternative restorative materials including bioengineered materials be actively promoted by the The International Association for Dental Research (IADR).<br />Third-party insurance systems (presumably including the NHS) reimburse for treatment using alternative materials.<br />There is a global change in the current paradigm from disease treatment to disease prevention and health promotion. This involves establishing national systematic continuing education training programmes in the use of alternative materials under the oversight of the Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI).<br /><br />The responsibilities of the members of the research community, the dental profession, the public health authorities, third party insurers, the dental manufacturing industry, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the WHO in bringing about the changes recommended by the report are emphasised. <br /><br />The future of dentistry<br />Make no mistake: this unassuming report is going to change the face of dentistry and probably represents the biggest shake-up since the formation of the profession. The UK government is going to have to comply with the recommendations and one day in the very near future there will be an announcement that dental amalgam is to be phased-down, or phased-out in preparation for a ban and this may happen sooner, I suspect, than many currently anticipate.<br /><br />Almost everyone resists forced change. The smart thing is to voluntarily change before compulsion and seize the advantage. This subject is going to enter the public arena in the next few years and patients are going to ask probing questions and to want informed answers.<br /><br />It is perhaps interesting to note that since a phase-out and complete ban on the use of dental amalgam in Norway, dentists have now expressed an active preference for alternative materials and a quarter of the dentists there now have no experience with amalgam at all. There have also been an increasing number of reports of adverse reactions to all dental materials of which the majority relate to amalgam.<br /><br />Those practitioners who are willing to undertake the necessary study and expense of up-grading their working practices to include the safe and effective removal and replacement of amalgam will be sought out in increasing numbers by informed patients. In addition, patients are going to need a huge amount of adjunctive support detoxifying mercury and other toxic metals and this may be something you might want to consider providing in-house by employing a naturopath or someone else skilled and knowledgeable in this specialist topic or by forming an alliance with local practitioners. <br /><br />It took me getting very sick indeed to make me wake up and smell the coffee on this issue. And it has taken me a decade in which I had to sell my dental practice, have been unable to work, have retrained as a naturopath, and spent tens of thousands of pounds to recover from occupational, personal (thimerasol, the mercury-based preservative used in vaccines and my own amalgam fillings) and accidental (an amalgam capsule broke and shattered) mercury poisoning. <br /><br />I genuinely pray that no one else has to go through what I have been through. <br /><br />And I hope that the dental profession collectively comes to its senses and leads the way on this issue rather than reluctantly bringing up the rear, and that within the next decade hundreds of thousands of dentists worldwide ask the question: &quot;What were we thinking?&quot;<br /><br />For more info, check out the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a>]natural recovery plan[/url].

Introduction<br /><br />As will be documented in this paper, the majority of the population receives significant mercury exposures and significant adverse health effects are common. &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]Mercury toxicity[/url] has been found to be an endocrine system disrupting chemical in animals and people, disrupting function of the pituitary gland; thyroid gland; parathyroid gland; thymus gland; adrenal gland; pineal gland; enzyme production processes, and affecting many hormonal and enzymatic functions at very low levels of exposure. <br /><br />The main factors determining whether chronic conditions are induced by metals appear to be exposure and genetic susceptibility, which determines individual’s immune sensitivity and ability to detoxify metals. Very low levels of exposure have been found to seriously affect large groups of individuals who are immune, sensitive to toxic metals, or have an inability to detoxify metals due to such as deficient sulphoxidation or metallothionein function or other inhibited enzymatic processes related to detoxification or excretion of metals. <br /><br />Thyroid gland conditions<br />Thyroid conditions are extremely common and adversely affect the health of millions of people, though most cases are undiagnosed. The thyroid gland secretes hormones which control the body’s metabolic rate, using iodine to create thyroid hormone. So iodine deficiency is a common cause of hypothyroid condition. <br /><br />The hypothalamus secretes a hormone which triggers thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland to cause the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (produced mostly T4). T4 is then converted in the body to the active thyroid hormone T3. A problem with any of these steps can cause hypothyroidism. As will be seen, toxic metal exposures such as mercury can accumulate and block or inhibit any of these necessary processes, as can other factors. Calcitonin is another hormone secreted by the thyroid gland that maintains blood calcium levels and prevents hypercalcaemia. <br /><br />Effects and symptoms of thyroid deficiency include: fatigue: nervousness; depression; increased allergies; cold sensitivity; skin problems; brittle nails; weight problems; constipation; infertility; memory problems; low immune function and carpal tunnel syndrome. <br /><br />Tests for thyroid deficiency include:                                                                                    <br /><br />Standard test is blood test for TSH level (concentrations chronically above 2.0 mU/l indicate thyroid problem and cause long term health effects). <br />Another sensitive thyroid function test is the TRH stimulation test. <br />Another test is the Achilles tendon reflex test.    <br />A good home test is the Barnes Basal Temperature Test (put a thermometer in reach of bed, before getting up take temperature under arm shoulder joint (holding tight for at least 3 minutes). Below 97.8 degrees indicates you are T3 deficient. Repeat several times. <br />Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is chronic inflammation of thyroid caused by an autoimmune reaction to environmental factors such as mercury or toxic metals or gluten sensitivity or milk casein sensitivity (which is commonly caused by toxic metals blocking enzymatic process needed to digest gluten or milk casein)(see later documentation).<br /><br />Adrenal gland conditions<br />Other common hormone problems are related to the adrenal glands. The adrenal medulla manufactures adrenaline and noradrenaline (adrenaline and noradrenaline) – the fight or flight hormones. The adrenal cortex makes steroid hormones (cortisone, hydrocortisone, testosterone, oestrogen, DHEA, pregnenolone, aldosterone, androstenedione and progesterone). Some of these are also made in other parts of the body. The hormone aldosterone, together with the kidneys, regulates the balance of sodium and potassium in the body, which is commonly out of balance. <br /><br />Besides imbalances of the various adrenal hormones that can cause effects, there are common chronic conditions that have been identified. Addison’s disease is chronic adrenal failure, usually related to autoimmune attack on the adrenal glands, commonly caused by toxic exposures such as mercury (see more later). It usually results in chronic hypocortisolism, resulting in inability to properly deal with stress. This also affects blood pressure, insulin regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Symptoms of Addison’s disease include: skin changes such as dark tanning on scars, skin folds, toes, lips, elbows, knees or knuckles. <br /><br />Cushing’s syndrome is overproduction of cortisol, usually related to a tumour of pituitary or other organs. It is also commonly caused by prescription steroid hormones. Symptoms include: stomach fat, thin extremities, moon face, buffalo hump, excessive hair growth, irregular menstrual periods and infertility. <br /><br />Adrenal fatigue can be caused by factors such as chronic anxiety or stress, or poor nutrition. The adrenals can become depleted leading to fatigue, weakening of immune response and disrupted sugar metabolism. Environmental toxic exposure such as mercury can block or inhibit any of the adrenal hormone processes and contribute to such conditions.<br /><br />II. Common exposures to significant levels of mercury and distribution in the body<br />Most people with several &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] get daily exposure of mercury at levels well above U.S. government health guidelines, which amount to about 4 to 8 micrograms per day. Mixed metals in the mouth such as amalgam dental fillings, metal crowns, and metal braces have been found to result in galvanic currents in the metals which drive the metals into the saliva and tissues of the oral cavity at high levels as well as systemically, with accumulations in the brain and hormonal glands. Additionally, electric and electromagnetic fields such as those from appliances, computer monitors and power lines cause electric currents in metals in the mouth which further increase exposures to mercury and other metals. <br /><br />Mercury and nickel, which are highly neurotoxic and immunotoxic, are often found at high levels in tests of those with mixed metals in the mouth and are known to commonly cause DNA damage; immune reactivity; and hormonal effects in animals and humans; including related reproductive effects. <br /><br />Government health agencies in other countries such as Health Canada and amalgam manufacturers have warned against using amalgam near other metals, but this is still common in the U.S. and several other countries. Children typically also get high levels of exposure to highly toxic organic mercury compounds such as ethyl mercury through thimerosal, used as a preservative in vaccines, and to methyl mercury from fish. Warnings to ban or limit consumption of fish have been issued for over 30 percent of all U.S. lakes, including all Great Lakes, as well as U.S. river miles and bays.<br /><br />Hypothyroidism<br />Studies have documented that mercury causes hypothyroidism; damage of thyroid RNA; autoimmune thyroiditis; and impairment of conversion of thyroid T4 hormone to the active T3 form. The thyroid gland has iodine binding sites where the iodine needed for its function is obtained. For those with chronic mercury exposure the mercury occupies some of the iodine binding sites, blocking full utilisation of iodine by the thyroid, in addition to the direct damage to the thyroid since mercury is highly cytotoxic. These studies and clinical experience indicate that mercury and toxic metal exposures appear to be the most common cause of hypothyroidism and the majority treated by metals detoxification recover or significantly improve.  <br /><br />The estimated prevalence of hypothyroidism from a large federal health survey, NHANES III, was 4.6%, but the incidence was twice as high for women as for men and many with sub-clinical hypothyroidism are not aware of their condition. Another large study found that 11.7% tested had abnormal thyroid TSH levels with 9.5% being hypothyroid and 2.1% hyperthyroid. According to survey tests, 8 to 10% of untreated women were found to have thyroid imbalances so the actual level of hypothyroidism is higher than commonly recognised. Even larger percentages of women had elevated levels of anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) or anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TP). Tests have found approximately 30% of pregnant women to have low free T4 in the first trimester.    <br /><br />Thyroid hormones are of primary importance for the perinatal development of the central nervous system, and for normal function of the adult brain. Hypothyroidism of the adults causes most frequently dementia and depression. Nearly all the hyperthyroid patients show minor psychiatric signs, and sometimes psychosis; dementia; confusion state; depression; apathetic thyrotoxicosis; thyrotoxic crisis; seizures; pyramidal signs or chorea occur. These hormones primarily regulate the transcription of specific target genes. They increase the cortical serotonergic neurotransmission, and play an important role in regulating central noradrenergic and GABA function. <br /><br />Mercury blocks thyroid hormone production by occupying iodine binding sites and inhibiting hormone action even when the measured thyroid level appears to be in proper range. The thyroid and hypothalamus regulate body temperature and many metabolic processes including enzymatic processes that when inhibited result in higher dental decay. Mercury damage thus commonly results in poor bodily temperature control, in addition to many problems caused by hormonal imbalances such as depression. Such hormonal secretions are affected at levels of mercury exposure much lower than the acute toxicity effects normally tested, as previously confirmed by hormonal/reproductive problems in animal populations. Mercury also damages the blood-brain barrier and facilitates penetration of the brain by other toxic metals and substances. Hypothyroidism is also known to be a major factor in cardiovascular disease. <br /><br />Hypothyroidism, pregnancy and breastfeeding<br />Studies indicate that slight thyroid deficiency/imbalance (sub-clinical) during the perinatal period can result in delayed neuropsychological development in neonate and child or permanent neuropsychiatric damage in the developing foetus or autism or mental retardation. Low first trimester levels of free T4 and positive levels of anti-TP antibodies in the mother during pregnancy have been found to result in significantly reduced IQs and causes psychomotor deficits. Women with the highest levels of thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH) and lowest free levels of thyroxin 17 weeks into their pregnancies were significantly more likely to have children who tested at least one standard deviation below normal on an IQ test taken at age 8 years of age. Based on study findings, maternal hypothyroidism appears to play a role in at least 15% of children whose IQs are more than 1 standard deviation below the mean ie: millions of children.<br /><br />Overt autoimmune thyroiditis is preceded by a rise in levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. &quot;Collectively, reports show that 30-60% of women positive for TPO antibodies in pregnancy develop postpartum thyroiditis,&quot; the researchers point out, calling it &quot;a strong association.&quot; Without treatment, many of the women with thyroiditis go on to develop overt clinical hypothyroidism as they age and, eventually, associated complications such as cardiovascular disease. About 7.5% of pregnant women develop thyroiditis after the birth. Studies have also established a connection between maternal thyroid disease and babies born with heart defects. <br /><br />Infants of women with hypothyroxinaemia at 12 weeks gestation had significantly lower scores on the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale orientation index compared with other subjects. Regression analysis showed that first trimester maternal free thyroid hormone T4 was a significant predictor of orientation scores. This study confirmed that maternal hypothyroxinaemia constitutes a serious risk factor for neurodevelopmental difficulties that can be identified in neonates as young as 3 weeks of age.<br /><br />Mercury (especially mercury vapour from dental amalgam or organic mercury) rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and is stored preferentially in the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, hypothalamus, and occipital cortex in direct proportion to the number and extent of dental amalgam surfaces, and likewise rapidly crosses the placenta and accumulates in the foetus including the foetal brain and hormone glands at levels commonly higher than the level in the mother. <br /><br />Milk from mothers with 7 or more mercury amalgam dental fillings was found to have levels of mercury approximately 10 times that of amalgam free mothers. The milk sampled ranged from 0.2 to 57 mcg/l. In a population of German women, the concentration of mercury in early breast milk ranged from 0.2 to 20.3 mcg/l. A Japanese study found that the average mercury level in samples tested increased 60% between 1980 and 1990. The study found that prenatal Hg exposure is correlated with lower scores in neuro-developmental screening, but more so in the linguistic pathway. The level of mercury in umbilical cord blood, meconium, and placenta is usually higher than that in mother's blood. <br /><br />Alterations of cortical neuronal migration and cerebellar Purkinje cells have been observed in autism. Neuronal migration, via reelin regulation, requires triiodothyronine (T3) produced by deiodination of thyroxine (T4) by foetal brain deiodinases. Experimental animal models have shown that transient intrauterine deficits of thyroid hormones (as brief as 3 days) result in permanent alterations of cerebral cortical architecture reminiscent of those observed in brains of patients with autism. Early maternal hypothyroxinaemia resulting in low T3 in the foetal brain during the period of neuronal cell migration (weeks 8-12 of pregnancy) may produce morphological brain changes leading to autism. Insufficient dietary iodine intake and a number of environmental antithyroid and goitrogenic agents such as mercury, soy, and peanuts can affect maternal thyroid function during pregnancy. <br /><br />Mercury can have significant effects on thyroid function even though the main hormone levels remain in the normal range, so the usual thyroid tests are not adequate in such cases.  Prenatal methylmercury exposure severely affects  the activity of selenoenzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and 5-iodothyronine deiodinases (5-Di and 5'-DI) in the foetal brain, even though thyroxine (T4) levels are normal. Another mechanism by which mercury exerts such effects is mercury’s effects on selenium levels which are required for conversion of T4 to T3. Gpx activity is severely inhibited, while 5-DI levels are decreased and 5'-DI increased in the foetal brain, similar to hypothyroidism.  Thus normal thyroid tests will not pick up this condition. <br /><br />Mercury reduces the blood’s ability to transport oxygen and essential nutrients including amino acids, glucose, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and vitamin B12 to the foetus; depresses enzyme isocitric dehydrogenase (ICD) in the foetus; causes reduced iodine uptake, autoimmune thyroiditis,  and hypothyroidism. Because of the evidence of widespread effects on infants, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists advises that all women considering becoming pregnant should get a serum thyrotropin test so that hypothyroidism can be diagnosed and treated early. Since mercury and toxic metals are common causes of hypothyroidism, another test that should be considered is a hair element test for mercury or toxic metal exposures and essential mineral imbalances. <br /><br />Studies have also established a “clear association” between the presence of thyroid antibodies and spontaneous abortions. Levels of recurrent abortions in a population with positive levels of thyroid antibodies in one study were 40%, 5 times the normal rate. Hypothyroidism is a well documented risk factor in spontaneous abortions and infertility. Another study of pregnant women who suffer from hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) found a four-times greater risk for miscarriage during the second trimester than those who don’t, and women with untreated thyroid deficiency were four-times more likely to have a child with a developmental disabilities. Mercury through its affects on the endocrine system is also documented to cause other reproductive effects such as infertility, low sperm counts, abnormal sperm, endometriosis, PMS and adverse effects on reproductive organs.<br /><br />For more information, check out the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a>]natural recovery plan[/url].

Introduction<br /><br />As will be documented in this paper, the majority of the population receives significant mercury exposures and significant adverse health effects are common. &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]Mercury toxicity[/url] has been found to be an endocrine system disrupting chemical in animals and people, disrupting function of the pituitary gland; thyroid gland; parathyroid gland; thymus gland; adrenal gland; pineal gland; enzyme production processes, and affecting many hormonal and enzymatic functions at very low levels of exposure. <br /><br />The main factors determining whether chronic conditions are induced by metals appear to be exposure and genetic susceptibility, which determines individual’s immune sensitivity and ability to detoxify metals. Very low levels of exposure have been found to seriously affect large groups of individuals who are immune, sensitive to toxic metals, or have an inability to detoxify metals due to such as deficient sulphoxidation or metallothionein function or other inhibited enzymatic processes related to detoxification or excretion of metals. <br /><br />Thyroid gland conditions<br />Thyroid conditions are extremely common and adversely affect the health of millions of people, though most cases are undiagnosed. The thyroid gland secretes hormones which control the body’s metabolic rate, using iodine to create thyroid hormone. So iodine deficiency is a common cause of hypothyroid condition. <br /><br />The hypothalamus secretes a hormone which triggers thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland to cause the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) (produced mostly T4). T4 is then converted in the body to the active thyroid hormone T3. A problem with any of these steps can cause hypothyroidism. As will be seen, toxic metal exposures such as mercury can accumulate and block or inhibit any of these necessary processes, as can other factors. Calcitonin is another hormone secreted by the thyroid gland that maintains blood calcium levels and prevents hypercalcaemia. <br /><br />Effects and symptoms of thyroid deficiency include: fatigue: nervousness; depression; increased allergies; cold sensitivity; skin problems; brittle nails; weight problems; constipation; infertility; memory problems; low immune function and carpal tunnel syndrome. <br /><br />Tests for thyroid deficiency include:                                                                                    <br /><br />Standard test is blood test for TSH level (concentrations chronically above 2.0 mU/l indicate thyroid problem and cause long term health effects). <br />Another sensitive thyroid function test is the TRH stimulation test. <br />Another test is the Achilles tendon reflex test.    <br />A good home test is the Barnes Basal Temperature Test (put a thermometer in reach of bed, before getting up take temperature under arm shoulder joint (holding tight for at least 3 minutes). Below 97.8 degrees indicates you are T3 deficient. Repeat several times. <br />Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is chronic inflammation of thyroid caused by an autoimmune reaction to environmental factors such as mercury or toxic metals or gluten sensitivity or milk casein sensitivity (which is commonly caused by toxic metals blocking enzymatic process needed to digest gluten or milk casein)(see later documentation).<br /><br />Adrenal gland conditions<br />Other common hormone problems are related to the adrenal glands. The adrenal medulla manufactures adrenaline and noradrenaline (adrenaline and noradrenaline) – the fight or flight hormones. The adrenal cortex makes steroid hormones (cortisone, hydrocortisone, testosterone, oestrogen, DHEA, pregnenolone, aldosterone, androstenedione and progesterone). Some of these are also made in other parts of the body. The hormone aldosterone, together with the kidneys, regulates the balance of sodium and potassium in the body, which is commonly out of balance. <br /><br />Besides imbalances of the various adrenal hormones that can cause effects, there are common chronic conditions that have been identified. Addison’s disease is chronic adrenal failure, usually related to autoimmune attack on the adrenal glands, commonly caused by toxic exposures such as mercury (see more later). It usually results in chronic hypocortisolism, resulting in inability to properly deal with stress. This also affects blood pressure, insulin regulation, inflammatory response, and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Symptoms of Addison’s disease include: skin changes such as dark tanning on scars, skin folds, toes, lips, elbows, knees or knuckles. <br /><br />Cushing’s syndrome is overproduction of cortisol, usually related to a tumour of pituitary or other organs. It is also commonly caused by prescription steroid hormones. Symptoms include: stomach fat, thin extremities, moon face, buffalo hump, excessive hair growth, irregular menstrual periods and infertility. <br /><br />Adrenal fatigue can be caused by factors such as chronic anxiety or stress, or poor nutrition. The adrenals can become depleted leading to fatigue, weakening of immune response and disrupted sugar metabolism. Environmental toxic exposure such as mercury can block or inhibit any of the adrenal hormone processes and contribute to such conditions.<br /><br />II. Common exposures to significant levels of mercury and distribution in the body<br />Most people with several &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] get daily exposure of mercury at levels well above U.S. government health guidelines, which amount to about 4 to 8 micrograms per day. Mixed metals in the mouth such as amalgam dental fillings, metal crowns, and metal braces have been found to result in galvanic currents in the metals which drive the metals into the saliva and tissues of the oral cavity at high levels as well as systemically, with accumulations in the brain and hormonal glands. Additionally, electric and electromagnetic fields such as those from appliances, computer monitors and power lines cause electric currents in metals in the mouth which further increase exposures to mercury and other metals. <br /><br />Mercury and nickel, which are highly neurotoxic and immunotoxic, are often found at high levels in tests of those with mixed metals in the mouth and are known to commonly cause DNA damage; immune reactivity; and hormonal effects in animals and humans; including related reproductive effects. <br /><br />Government health agencies in other countries such as Health Canada and amalgam manufacturers have warned against using amalgam near other metals, but this is still common in the U.S. and several other countries. Children typically also get high levels of exposure to highly toxic organic mercury compounds such as ethyl mercury through thimerosal, used as a preservative in vaccines, and to methyl mercury from fish. Warnings to ban or limit consumption of fish have been issued for over 30 percent of all U.S. lakes, including all Great Lakes, as well as U.S. river miles and bays.<br /><br />Hypothyroidism<br />Studies have documented that mercury causes hypothyroidism; damage of thyroid RNA; autoimmune thyroiditis; and impairment of conversion of thyroid T4 hormone to the active T3 form. The thyroid gland has iodine binding sites where the iodine needed for its function is obtained. For those with chronic mercury exposure the mercury occupies some of the iodine binding sites, blocking full utilisation of iodine by the thyroid, in addition to the direct damage to the thyroid since mercury is highly cytotoxic. These studies and clinical experience indicate that mercury and toxic metal exposures appear to be the most common cause of hypothyroidism and the majority treated by metals detoxification recover or significantly improve.  <br /><br />The estimated prevalence of hypothyroidism from a large federal health survey, NHANES III, was 4.6%, but the incidence was twice as high for women as for men and many with sub-clinical hypothyroidism are not aware of their condition. Another large study found that 11.7% tested had abnormal thyroid TSH levels with 9.5% being hypothyroid and 2.1% hyperthyroid. According to survey tests, 8 to 10% of untreated women were found to have thyroid imbalances so the actual level of hypothyroidism is higher than commonly recognised. Even larger percentages of women had elevated levels of anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) or anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TP). Tests have found approximately 30% of pregnant women to have low free T4 in the first trimester.    <br /><br />Thyroid hormones are of primary importance for the perinatal development of the central nervous system, and for normal function of the adult brain. Hypothyroidism of the adults causes most frequently dementia and depression. Nearly all the hyperthyroid patients show minor psychiatric signs, and sometimes psychosis; dementia; confusion state; depression; apathetic thyrotoxicosis; thyrotoxic crisis; seizures; pyramidal signs or chorea occur. These hormones primarily regulate the transcription of specific target genes. They increase the cortical serotonergic neurotransmission, and play an important role in regulating central noradrenergic and GABA function. <br /><br />Mercury blocks thyroid hormone production by occupying iodine binding sites and inhibiting hormone action even when the measured thyroid level appears to be in proper range. The thyroid and hypothalamus regulate body temperature and many metabolic processes including enzymatic processes that when inhibited result in higher dental decay. Mercury damage thus commonly results in poor bodily temperature control, in addition to many problems caused by hormonal imbalances such as depression. Such hormonal secretions are affected at levels of mercury exposure much lower than the acute toxicity effects normally tested, as previously confirmed by hormonal/reproductive problems in animal populations. Mercury also damages the blood-brain barrier and facilitates penetration of the brain by other toxic metals and substances. Hypothyroidism is also known to be a major factor in cardiovascular disease. <br /><br />Hypothyroidism, pregnancy and breastfeeding<br />Studies indicate that slight thyroid deficiency/imbalance (sub-clinical) during the perinatal period can result in delayed neuropsychological development in neonate and child or permanent neuropsychiatric damage in the developing foetus or autism or mental retardation. Low first trimester levels of free T4 and positive levels of anti-TP antibodies in the mother during pregnancy have been found to result in significantly reduced IQs and causes psychomotor deficits. Women with the highest levels of thyroid-stimulating-hormone (TSH) and lowest free levels of thyroxin 17 weeks into their pregnancies were significantly more likely to have children who tested at least one standard deviation below normal on an IQ test taken at age 8 years of age. Based on study findings, maternal hypothyroidism appears to play a role in at least 15% of children whose IQs are more than 1 standard deviation below the mean ie: millions of children.<br /><br />Overt autoimmune thyroiditis is preceded by a rise in levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies. &quot;Collectively, reports show that 30-60% of women positive for TPO antibodies in pregnancy develop postpartum thyroiditis,&quot; the researchers point out, calling it &quot;a strong association.&quot; Without treatment, many of the women with thyroiditis go on to develop overt clinical hypothyroidism as they age and, eventually, associated complications such as cardiovascular disease. About 7.5% of pregnant women develop thyroiditis after the birth. Studies have also established a connection between maternal thyroid disease and babies born with heart defects. <br /><br />Infants of women with hypothyroxinaemia at 12 weeks gestation had significantly lower scores on the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale orientation index compared with other subjects. Regression analysis showed that first trimester maternal free thyroid hormone T4 was a significant predictor of orientation scores. This study confirmed that maternal hypothyroxinaemia constitutes a serious risk factor for neurodevelopmental difficulties that can be identified in neonates as young as 3 weeks of age.<br /><br />Mercury (especially mercury vapour from dental amalgam or organic mercury) rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and is stored preferentially in the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, hypothalamus, and occipital cortex in direct proportion to the number and extent of dental amalgam surfaces, and likewise rapidly crosses the placenta and accumulates in the foetus including the foetal brain and hormone glands at levels commonly higher than the level in the mother. <br /><br />Milk from mothers with 7 or more mercury amalgam dental fillings was found to have levels of mercury approximately 10 times that of amalgam free mothers. The milk sampled ranged from 0.2 to 57 mcg/l. In a population of German women, the concentration of mercury in early breast milk ranged from 0.2 to 20.3 mcg/l. A Japanese study found that the average mercury level in samples tested increased 60% between 1980 and 1990. The study found that prenatal Hg exposure is correlated with lower scores in neuro-developmental screening, but more so in the linguistic pathway. The level of mercury in umbilical cord blood, meconium, and placenta is usually higher than that in mother's blood. <br /><br />Alterations of cortical neuronal migration and cerebellar Purkinje cells have been observed in autism. Neuronal migration, via reelin regulation, requires triiodothyronine (T3) produced by deiodination of thyroxine (T4) by foetal brain deiodinases. Experimental animal models have shown that transient intrauterine deficits of thyroid hormones (as brief as 3 days) result in permanent alterations of cerebral cortical architecture reminiscent of those observed in brains of patients with autism. Early maternal hypothyroxinaemia resulting in low T3 in the foetal brain during the period of neuronal cell migration (weeks 8-12 of pregnancy) may produce morphological brain changes leading to autism. Insufficient dietary iodine intake and a number of environmental antithyroid and goitrogenic agents such as mercury, soy, and peanuts can affect maternal thyroid function during pregnancy. <br /><br />Mercury can have significant effects on thyroid function even though the main hormone levels remain in the normal range, so the usual thyroid tests are not adequate in such cases.  Prenatal methylmercury exposure severely affects  the activity of selenoenzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and 5-iodothyronine deiodinases (5-Di and 5'-DI) in the foetal brain, even though thyroxine (T4) levels are normal. Another mechanism by which mercury exerts such effects is mercury’s effects on selenium levels which are required for conversion of T4 to T3. Gpx activity is severely inhibited, while 5-DI levels are decreased and 5'-DI increased in the foetal brain, similar to hypothyroidism.  Thus normal thyroid tests will not pick up this condition. <br /><br />Mercury reduces the blood’s ability to transport oxygen and essential nutrients including amino acids, glucose, magnesium, zinc, selenium, and vitamin B12 to the foetus; depresses enzyme isocitric dehydrogenase (ICD) in the foetus; causes reduced iodine uptake, autoimmune thyroiditis,  and hypothyroidism. Because of the evidence of widespread effects on infants, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists advises that all women considering becoming pregnant should get a serum thyrotropin test so that hypothyroidism can be diagnosed and treated early. Since mercury and toxic metals are common causes of hypothyroidism, another test that should be considered is a hair element test for mercury or toxic metal exposures and essential mineral imbalances. <br /><br />Studies have also established a “clear association” between the presence of thyroid antibodies and spontaneous abortions. Levels of recurrent abortions in a population with positive levels of thyroid antibodies in one study were 40%, 5 times the normal rate. Hypothyroidism is a well documented risk factor in spontaneous abortions and infertility. Another study of pregnant women who suffer from hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) found a four-times greater risk for miscarriage during the second trimester than those who don’t, and women with untreated thyroid deficiency were four-times more likely to have a child with a developmental disabilities. Mercury through its affects on the endocrine system is also documented to cause other reproductive effects such as infertility, low sperm counts, abnormal sperm, endometriosis, PMS and adverse effects on reproductive organs.<br /><br />For more information, check out the &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a>]natural recovery plan[/url].

Some of the toxic elements the tests aim to detect are mercury, chlorine, iron, aluminium, arsenic, copper, lead, cadmium and nickel. <br /><br />Most analyses look at the profile of the essential minerals and toxic metals in the sample and sometimes the ratios of particular elements may also give an indirect indication of the presence of toxic metals.<br /><br />One of the great problems with testing for toxic metals is the fact that they are mistaken by the body for essential minerals such as selenium and incorporated into enzymes and proteins throughout the body. <br /><br />They also bind to specific cell organelles such as the mitochondria and to cell membrane receptors so that circulating amounts of toxic metals found in the blood are a very poor indicator of the amount of &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury poisoning[/url] within the tissues. <br /><br />The most appropriate test to use also depends upon whether the toxin exposure is thought to be chronic or acute. If there has been a mercury spill for example, blood tests may prove to be the most pertinent test, whereas if you are testing for chronic &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url], hair testing may be more appropriate.<br /><br />The advantages and shortcomings of each method of testing are addressed below. <br /><br />Blood tests for toxic metals<br />An element analysis of blood examines the minerals found within the red blood cells whereas the toxic metal analysis is usually of whole blood. <br /><br />Blood tests are generally a poor measure of the levels of toxic metals found within the tissues in different organs as they only reveal what is happening outside the cell and the waste material being discarded at a particular moment in time. <br /><br />If you visualise the circulation as being the waterways within a country, the fact that a sample of water tests negative for a particular substance does not mean that it is not being stored in some facility on dry land. And so it is with the body.<br /><br />So a negative test definitely does not rule out the possibility of a specific toxicity. However, if a blood sample tests positive for a specific metal then there is likely to be a toxicity issue around at least that element.<br /><br />Hair analysis of toxic metals<br />Next to blood, hair is the second most metabolically active tissue in the body. One of the great advantages of hair analysis is that is is non-invasive, simple and does not involve a doctor and so can easily be used on children with learning disorders, for example. <br /><br />The proponents of using hair analysis claim that because the hair is made up of dead cells that have been exposed to both the internal environment of the body and to the external environment, the hair captures the exposure to minerals and toxic metals over a period of several months. <br /><br />They also claim that hair analysis more accurately reflects what is stored within the cells unlike blood testing. Hair also concentrates heavy metals several hundred fold above the concentrations found in the blood thus enabling detection of the presence of these toxic elements.<br /><br />A typical hair analysis would give profiles for metals such as antimony, arsenic, nickel, mercury, cadmium, tin, lead and aluminium, essential minerals and some other elements along with mineral and toxic metal ratios. <br /><br />In a report in 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that hair analysis is a superior method of testing for toxic metals to that of blood and urine testing. However, the American Medical Association opposes hair analysis when it is used to indicate the need for medical therapy.<br /><br />Studies have found statistically significant differences between the hair samples of healthy people and those with autism and learning disabilities, multiple sclerosis, dementia, protein deficient diets, and histories of violent criminal behaviour.<br /><br />A 1978 study found that hair samples taken from multiple sclerosis sufferers showed significant differences in levels of copper, vanadium, iodine, manganese, sulphur and selenium when compared to healthy subjects. <br /><br />However, one of the big problems with hair testing was revealed in a study conducted by Holmes at al and published in the International Journal of Toxicology in 2003. In the study, the hair samples of autistic children were compared to those of healthy subjects and to the consternation of the researchers they found that the levels of mercury in the hair samples of the autistic children was one-eighth of that found in the healthy children. <br /><br />This led to the supposition that the reason the children had autism was precisely because they were unable to excrete mercury and the same may well be true of fatigue syndrome sufferers.<br /><br />The study also gathered information from the mother about diet, dental amalgam fillings and vaccination history and found that the mothers of the autistic children had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure than the mothers of the healthy children. The amounts of mercury found in the hair samples of the healthy children correlated with the mercury exposure of the mother, but this correlation was not found in the autistic group.<br /><br />Another issue with hair analysis is that if you chemically treat your hair with perms or hair dyes, then you need to wait for at least 6 weeks after the last treatment before taking a hair sample which is ideally taken from the roots.<br /><br />Urine tests for toxic metals<br />Urine tests can be used to measure urinary excretion of minerals and toxic metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, aluminium and arsenic.<br /><br />Samples can be collected either over 6-8 hours or 24 hours with the 6-8 hour collection profiles primarily intended for those who are receiving oral or intravenous chelating agents to mobilise toxic elements from body pools. The 24-hour collection profiles give the total output of minerals and toxic elements per day.<br /><br />Provocation testing for toxic metals<br />A provocation, chelation or Kelmer challenge test needs to be performed by a physician that specialises in chelation therapy. The patient is given a chelating agent in order to mobilise heavy metals from storage in body compartments and urine samples are collected either after the provocation or before and after for analysis. <br /><br />Typically, an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) challenge has been used in lead-exposed individuals and either DMPS (2, 3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid) or DMSA in mercury-exposed subjects. <br /><br />The disadvantages to this method are that it requires a visit to a specialist physician's office, it is expensive, and there is a possibility of a reaction to the chelating drugs which are synthetic chemicals.<br /><br />Both DMSA and DMPS are chelating agents that have sulfhydryl (-SH) or thiol groups that form complexes with various heavy metals. Thiols are often referred to as mercaptans with the term being derived from the Latin mercurium captans (meaning capturing mercury) because the thiol group bonds so strongly with mercury compounds. The sulphurous thiol groups also give these substances a mildly unpleasant odour. <br /><br />DMPS is usually given by intravenous infusion whereas DMSA is generally taken orally. DMSA is considered to be much safer than DMPS because it has one-third of the toxicity and also because it is less likely to bind minerals for excretion in the urine. <br /><br />The use of oral chelating agents is generally considered to be safer because the individual can start with a low dose to test tolerance and gradually increase the dose and can also stop taking the drug if they experience a negative reaction.<br /><br />DMSA cannot cross the blood-brain barrier so will not directly clear mercury deposits from the brain. This means that using DMSA as a way of assessing the body burden of mercury has its limitations since it is not mobilising mercury from the central nervous system and brain. <br /><br />There are also concerns that DMSA can mobilise heavy metals within the blood stream from where they may further accumulate within the brain and central nervous system. Others feel that the body is constantly redistributing its toxic load and that deposits within the brain will be removed indirectly as the body burden of mercury is gradually reduced.<br /><br />In a study of former employees of a chloralkali plant for whom detailed mercury exposure histories were available, urine samples were collected before and after the administration of two fairly low doses of DMSA. The amount of urinary mercury excreted by the subjects nearly doubled after administration of the DMSA. <br /><br />However the researchers found no association between past occupational mercury exposure and the urinary excretion of mercury either before or after DMSA administration and therefore conclude that provocation urine levels were not useful as a biomarker of past mercury exposure. <br /><br />The shortcoming of this study is that it considered only occupational exposure, but of course, there are many other significant sources of mercury such as vaccinations and dental amalgam fillings (Frumkin et al, Environ. Health Perspect. 109 (2): 167–71).  <br /><br />In another experiment, healthy volunteers took fairly low doses of DMSA and urinary mercury : creatinine ratios were measured both before and 3 hours after administration. No detectable differences were found and one volunteer suffered a serious reaction to the DMSA. <br /><br />This led the authors of the study to conclude that testing using DMSA may lead to misleading diagnostic advice regarding potential mercury toxicity and can be associated with serious side-effects (Archbold et al, Ann. Clin. Biochem. 41).<br /><br />So, whilst using a provocation test probably gives a better indication of the body burden of mercury, it is not infallible and without side-effects. <br /><br />Vega and muscle testing<br />Both these techniques use homeopathic dilutions of the various toxic metals and an assessment of how these substances affect the energy flows in the meridians. In the case of muscle testing this is assessed by placed a vial in or on the subject being tested and then a kinesiologist or other therapist will assess the strength or otherwise of an indicator muscle using light pressure. <br /><br />However, because the toxic metals have bound to the tissues and often because they have been stored during periods of trauma and stress the body is not consciously aware of their presence and a special technique may be required to unlock these hidden reserves prior to effective muscle testing.<br /><br />Vega testing uses electrical measurements of the energy flows in the meridians to assess the body's reaction to a variety of toxins and potential stressors. A decreased reading when a homeopathic sample is introduced into a circuit created by the client holding a probe and the practitioner touching various acupuncture points with a test probe indicates a specific toxicity or poor tolerance to that substance. <br /><br />MELISA testing<br />The MELISA or memory lymphocyte immuno-stimulation assay is a blood test which can identify allergies to specific metals. This is useful prior to having any form of metal implant where a choice is available, but does not identify metal toxicity although allergy and toxicity may coexist. <br /><br />Final thoughts on testing for toxic metals<br />No test is 100% and all have their shortcomings with the accuracy of Vega and muscle testing being largely practitioner dependent.<br /><br />In my opinion if you are still responding positively to many of the questions asked in the Mercury Toxicity Questionnaire on page 104/105 of The Natural Recovery Plan book then you are still mercury toxic. The Full Symptom Assessment Questionnaire in The Natural Recovery Club is also intended to help you monitor your recovery as symptoms of mercury poisoning fade slowly over time with detoxification. <br /><br />Although detoxifying mercury primarily via the kidneys using chelating agents will work it places the kidneys under considerable stress and probably causes irreversible damage to the delicate mechanisms involved. Using chlorella supplements to draw toxic metals out through the intestinal lining and bile is much less dangerous as the intestine has a large surface area that is regularly replaced - unlike the kidneys.

Toxicity in general, and specifically chronic &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury poisoning[/url], adversely affects the delicate immune system and promotes overgrowth of fungi which also produce toxins which further overwhelm the immune response.<br /><br />This means that viruses in particular cannot be effectively destroyed and become latent within the cells further compromising health and cell function. Fungal and viral infections further disable the immune system and change the terrain to the point where parasites are able to establish unchallenged. These can prove hard to remove and drag your general health down yet further.<br /><br />Yeasts<br /><br />Wherever mercury is found, yeasts and in particular the yeast, Candida albicans will inevitably establish. This is because candida is able to generate energy by converting one form of mercury to another and also the mercury disables the immune response.<br /><br />Candida albicans<br />Candida albicans is a yeast that cohabits in most people's intestines and on their skin. The function of all yeasts is the decomposition of once-living matter in order to return it to the soil from which it came and without yeasts life on earth would not be viable. Normally, a combination of our immune system and competition for resources from other friendly bacteria keep yeasts - and especially Candida albicans in check.<br /><br />However, in the individual suffering with chronic mercury poisoning, the candida can morph from its spore into its mould form putting out branched known as hyphae from which it releases more spores. In this manner it can penetrate through the various barriers of the body and can spread within the body in its spore form.<br /><br />The perforation of the intestinal lining means that improperly digested foods enter the circulation where they are identified by the immune system as 'foreign proteins' and attacked. In this manner multiple food intolerances can develop.<br /><br />The Candida albicans also releases large quantities of candotoxins including acetaldehyde and these toxins may account for many of the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, M.E., fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases as listed below:<br /><br />Recurrent ear, nose and throat infections, sinusitis and tonsillitis<br />Inflammation of the prostate gland in men and endometriosis in women<br />Cystitis and the need for frequent urination<br />Muscle and joint swelling and pain<br />Digestive disorders including IBS, continuous dull abdominal ache and heartburn<br />Cravings for sweet, starchy foods and/or alcohol<br />Impaired memory and confusion<br />Mood swings, irritability and depression<br />Loss of libido<br />Bronchitis and asthma<br />Feeling generally unwell and fatigued<br />Frequent headaches or migraines<br />Food and multiple chemical sensitivities<br />Fungal infections such as thrush, athlete’s foot and fungal toenails<br /><br />Viruses<br />Viruses are not regarded as living, because they are just genetic material in a protective outer shell. Their sole purpose is to invade living cells and insert their own genome into the host’s cells, thus assuming control over the cell’s functions. In this fashion, the host cell is used to replicate the virus. In some instances, this altered genetic coding can lead to ‘rogue’ cancer cells. <br /><br />Viruses have also evolved sophisticated mechanisms for evading detection and destruction by the human immune system and may be responsible for the so-called ‘autoimmune’ diseases where the body appears to attack its own cells, but in reality the body is trying to combat a virus within the host’s cells.<br /><br />Whatever the cause, at least several viruses are usually identified sequentially in those suffering with chronic fatigue syndrome, M.E., fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases. Any virus can and may be involved in these fatigue syndromes, but the herpes and enterovirus families of viruses seem to be implicated more often than others.<br /><br />Bacterial infections<br />Infective bacterial agents such as those causing salmonella, pneumonia, chlamydia and tuberculosis have all been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome, M.E., fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases, but by far the most important bacterial agent is Borrelia Bergdorferi which gives rise to Lyme disease or Borreliosis.<br /><br />Borrelia bergdorferi<br />Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial infection contracted from a tick bite in much the same way as malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes. It is one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases and, like the meningitis virus, seems to be carried by a majority of people, but only adversely affects susceptible individuals. The initiating tick bite will induce an angry rash, and in the early stages the individual may have headaches and flu-like symptoms, but the disease can then progress to affect almost any body system and mimics other infections, for which Lyme disease has earned the title ‘The great imitator’.<br /><br />Secondary sites of infection can cause:<br /><br />Muscle and joint pains<br />Arthritis<br />Psychiatric problems<br />Heart abnormalities<br />Neurological complaints<br />Profound fatigue<br /><br />Parasites<br />A parasite is defined as an organism that lives in or on another host organism. The parasite usually competes with the host for nutrients or feeds on the host’s tissues and usually causes some degree of injury. They also usually produce substances that are toxic to the host and may over time disable the immune system and tax the liver.<br /><br />There are a hundred types of common human parasites ranging from the microscopic to large intestinal worms and infection is common, with many people carrying multiple parasites. Infections are often contracted through eating undercooked infected meat, contact with infected soil or witting or unwitting faecal/oral contact from not washing hands after going to the toilet or before preparing food. <br /><br />Detection can prove problematic because parasites have complex life cycles and typically have quiescent and active phases.  Parasites have developed means of evading the immune response and can control their host’s behaviour by producing cravings for sugar and carbohydrates, for instance.<br /><br />There is no part of the body that is immune to parasitic infection and the possibility should be considered in any cases of chronic health problems - especially the fatigue syndromes. The symptoms that parasites produce include: <br /><br />Erratic bowel habits<br />Foul smelling stools<br />Alternating constipation and diarrhoea<br />Abdominal cramps/gurgling not related to hunger<br />Chest pains<br />Swollen/sore breasts not related to menstrual cycle<br />Flu-like symptoms<br />Coughing/wheezing with fever<br />Anxiety<br />Sleep disturbances<br />Food allergies<br />Itchy anus - especially at night<br />Losing weight yet being ravenous<br />Depression<br />Chronic fatigue<br />Teeth grinding at night<br />Excessive flatulence<br />Headaches<br />Itchy skin, rashes<br />Asthma<br /><br />Treatment of infections<br />Although sometimes short term management of an infection is required, the only long-term solution to all the above issues is to treat the underlying chronic mercury poisoning using a programme of detoxification whilst supporting the organs of excretion and providing the nutrients necessary to rebuild the immune and/or endocrine systems.<br /><br />Check out more information on &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] and how they have mercury toxicity.

As seen the following, in add-on to cancers brought on by radiation, pesticides, and also other organic substances, toxic metals which include mercury have major effects on deterioration the disease fighting capability and facilitating cancer.<br /><br />Professional medical labs, professional medical studies, and federal agencies get documented which &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>] dental care amalgam fillings [/url] could be the largest source of mercury for most individuals who several amalgam fillings. Species of fish, vaccinations, and work-related exposure like dental workplaces are other options for significant mercury exposures. A nationwide survey identified that above 22 percent of tested for mercury levels inside hair had dangerous levels higher than the Oughout. S. EPA mercury health reference stage. Toxic metal levels were measured within 6-24 a long time urinary examples of 100 aimlessly chosen people with serious conditions at the Institute involving Integrative Medicine following a combined EDTA/DMSA provocation test. Over 70% had levels of lead, arsenic, mercury, or cadmium outside of the Laboratory Benchmark Level.<br /><br />A sizable U. S. Centers for Disease Control epidemiological examine, NHANES III, found that include those with more amalgam fillings (much more mercury exposure) get significantly higher amounts of chronic health problems. The conditions that the number with dental amalgam surfaces were the majority highly correlated with condition incidence were MS, epilepsy, migraines, mental disorders, diseases with the nervous system, disorders of the thyroid gland, tumor, and infectious health conditions.<br /><br />&lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>] Mercury poisoning [/url] and other toxic metals which include copper together with lead cause breaks within DNA and get synergistic effects with x-rays. A few toxic precious metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel, are generally documented being carcinogenic. Most of the mechanisms by which toxic metals like mercury cause cancer have been documented just by many healthcare studies. Low non-cytotoxic amounts of mercury induce dose dependent binding with mercury to DNA and significantly improved cell mutations and birth anomalies. In addition to side effects on DNA, mercury additionally promotes cancer in various ways. Mercury as a result of its influence of deterioration the defense mechanisms contributes to increased serious diseases and cancer.<br /><br />Nobel Award winner Doctor. Otto Warburg concluded that cancer has merely one prime trigger. It could be the replacement associated with normal oxygen respiration of the body's skin cells by a great anaerobic (we. e., oxygen-deficient) cellular respiration. Porphyrins are generally precursors to help heme, the oxygen carrying component of blood. Mercury prevents the conversion of specific porphyrins to heme. Mercury may be documented to help bind to help oxygen taking sites in the blood, reducing a personâ??s available oxygen give. Mercury binds using haemoglobin, that's located inside the red maintain cell together with carries air for transportation to flesh. Mercury sure to haemoglobin results in less oxygen carrying capacity with the red blood cell and therefore less air will reach the flesh. The body senses the demand for more oxygen and will attempt to pay for that by increasing the manufacturing of haemoglobin. A normal or improved haemoglobin level combined with symptoms of lack of oxygen (stress and fatigue, weakness, being pale, rapid pulse rate, shortness of breath, etc) may well indicate mercury toxicity. But this will confuse a few doctors since patient seems like they are anaemic but in fact the blood matters seem okay.<br /><br />At this energetic-molecular level, the boundary between health and the state of absence of health is actually marked as a result of oxidosis, acidosis, and dysoxygenosis (dysox). There does exist but an individual fundamental change between a good cell and an unwell cell: proper cell contains a well maintained oxygen homeostasis. A normal cell uses oxygen well, without incremental oxidative pressure (oxidosis) and without accumulating organic acids (acidosis). In contrast, an unwell cell is unable to utilise oxygen well and gets blocked up using Krebs cycle metabolites and also other organic acids. In the bioenergetic mobile or portable level, just about all inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders are brought on by the oxygen disorder (dysfunctional much needed oxygen utilisation) caused by cellular toxicity in the cells.<br /><br />Mercury with dental amalgams appears to be one of the most, if not probably the most, potent disrupters with oxygen metabolism inside oral tooth cavity. Other like disrupters are generally thioethers related to root canal teeth and also cavitations and also other microbial waste. Those variables also alter the area conditions that will either slow down or foster microbial increase, so aiding biofilm formation. Such dynamics manage to play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis with systemic disorders rooted in the oral cavity. The crucial importance of oral toxicity in triggering, amplifying, together with perpetuating systemic inflammatory and infectious symptoms has largely been avoided by the majority doctors and dentists. The presence with the cellular dysox state can be readily documented through the measurement involving 24-hour urinary removal of all natural acids.<br /><br />Mercury may be found to help bind oxygen binding web-sites in haemoglobin, thus reducing usage of oxygen carried by way of the blood. Oxyhaemoglobin saturation levels in venous blood ought to be at at a minimum 60% with regard to normal levels. The tastes a group of 27 patients with amalgam dental fillings suffering from chronic weakness whose oxyhaemoglobin has been tested had lower than normal oxyhaemoglobin saturation levels. After amalgam replacement most those using oxyhaemoglobin levels equal to or as few as 45% experienced significant increases in oxyhaemoglobin vividness levels, on average about 15%. Heme is used for two main capabilities, in crimson blood cells and with production of energy by enzymatic processes inside ATP cytochrome oxidase system. Mercury and other toxics are documented to block a lot of these enzymatic processes, resulting within dumping porphyrin wastes in the urine in lieu of completing the right heme functions. The amount of these porphyrins inside urine may be measured by a standard urine examination, the fractionated porphyrin examination, and indicate the amount of toxic disruption with the basic enzymatic ATP production process. The vast majority of patients in the study possessed high levels of porphyrins in the urine, which often decreased considerably after amalgam replacement. This in addition has been validated by other studies.<br /><br />Mercury from amalgam binds on the -SH (sulfhydryl) groups, resulting within inactivation involving sulphur and blocking with enzyme functions which include cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), gamma-glutamyltraspeptidase (GGC) and sulphite oxidase, producing sulphur metabolites using extreme toxicity that this body struggles to properly detox, along which includes a deficiency within sulphates required for many entire body functions. Sulphur is essential in enzymes, hormones, neurological tissue, and red maintain cells. These are in existence in a whole lot of enzymatic process in your body Mercury additionally blocks the metabolic measures of manganese and the entry with calcium ions inside cytoplasm. Mercury with amalgam thus maintain a pool of potential to disturb all metabolic process. Mercury is usually transported through the entire body with blood and can affect cells in the body and organs inside ways causing numerous categories of chronic health problems including our blood conditions and cancer.<br /><br />Mercury contains a high appreciation for together with readily binds to selenium and to the thiol and sulfhydryl (sulphur/hydrogen combination) web-sites in residing tissues. The larger the selling point between chemicals or elements, the more powerful they bond to each other, and the harder it can be to standalone them. The thiol combination is extremely common in the human body. It occurs included in certain proteins, which are building blocks of meats. Since these proteins are used to build skin cells, hormones, and enzymes, the occurrence with the thiol combination in the body is but not just common but extremely important, as usual function is altered. There are plenty of thiol sites in the haemoglobin molecule in debt blood cells used to transport oxygen in the body. Mercury gathers up in green blood skin cells in humans and other animals. When mercury attaches to your thiol web-sites, the haemoglobin can't carry the maximum amount of oxygen since it could. This results in decreased availability of oxygen (hypoxia) that's needed as a result of all body cells and explains the best way that mercury toxicity might cause chronic fatigue symptoms and also other effects with low air levels inside cells.<br /><br />Toxic sheet metal exposures damaging influence with thyrocytes might play a significant role in thyroid melanoma aetiology. The type of with chronic immune system problems using related protected antibodies, the forms showing the highest level associated with antibody reductions after amalgam removal include thyroglobulin together with microsomal thyroid antigens. Similar outcomes regarding mercury have been found with regard to treatment of other kinds of cancer. Studies have found conventional chemotherapy (by itself) to become only somewhat more effective as compared to no treatment and clinical cases get demonstrated that detoxification together with nutritional support can be effective with treating several myeloma and other cancers.<br /><br />Contact with mercury fumes causes reduced zinc and methionine availability, depresses premiums of methylation, and increased 100 % free radicals â?? just about all factors with increased susceptibility to help cancer. Amalgam fillings are also found to be positively with oral tumor. Mercury with amalgam fillings has also been identified to cause increase with white blood cells and in some cases to trigger leukaemia. There's evidence that will some options leukaemia are abnormal response to antigenic stimulation by mercury or other these kinds of toxics, and entire dental revising including removing of amalgam has led to remission really rapidly in some cases. Among a group of patients testing positive as allergic to help mercury, low level mercury subjection was seen to cause adverse immune system response, including effects on vitro production of tumour necrosis component TNF alfa and reductions in interleukin-1.<br /><br />Mercury may be found to help cause decreased sperm amount and motility, improved sperm abnormalities and spontaneous abortions, improved uterine fibroids/endometritis, and decreased sperm count in wildlife and with humans. In studies of women having miscarriages and birth anomalies, husbands have been found to typically have low orgasm counts and significantly more visually abnormal sperm. It's now estimated that as much 85 % of your sperm produced by a healthy male is usually DNA-damaged. Abnormal sperm is also being blamed to get a global increase in testicular tumor, birth problems, and other reproductive conditions.<br /><br />There are generally extensive discussed cases (plenty) where by removal involving amalgam fillings triggered cure and also significant progress of serious health conditions such as oral keratosis (pre-cancer), tumor (breast area, leukaemia, or anything else.).<br /><br />Some studies get increased chance of lung, kidney, head, and CNS system cancers with dental workers. Other research reviewed seen increased premiums of brain cancer linked to mercury subjection. Dr. Max Daunderer's serial biopsies with malignant tumours in-patients that had amalgam fillings seen toxic metals from amalgam inside tumour. The concentration is highest in the middle of that tumour (malignant melanoma, head cancer, bladder, stomach, colon together with tongue tumor. An work-related study found that careers with likely contact with mercury and also arsenic such as dental nursing staff displayed increased risk associated with melanoma.<br /><br />Some studies have also found persons with chronic exposure to electromagnetic farms (EMF) to own higher relieve of mercury from dental amalgam, higher levels of mercury exposure and removal and higher chances of getting chronic conditions like ALS together with Alzheimerâ??s and cancer.<br /><br />Mercury causes significant exploitation of stomach and intestinal tract epithelial cells, resulting in damage to stomach lining which along with mercuryâ??s capacity bind to help SH hydroxyl revolutionary in mobile or portable membranes changes permeability together with adversely changes bacterial populations in the intestines â?? causing leaky belly syndrome with toxic, incompletely waste complexes inside blood and accumulation associated with heliobacter pylori, a alleged major thing in stomach ulcers together with stomach melanoma and candida albicans, as well as bad nutrient absorption.<br /><br />From comprehensive clinical go through the spread of cancer has been commonly found being related to fungal/Candida incidence, and treating Candida as a result of blood alkalinity equilibrium and drop of harmful metals body level may be found to lower the spread of tumor. Such treatments also increase oxygen supply to your cells. An anaerobic environment favours this development associated with yeast infections and tumor, since yeast is a fermenting spore together with cancer is a fermenting cell rather than normal respiratory : (much needed oxygen using) cell.<br /><br />Mercury has a symbiotic regards to Candida in your body and encourages the proliferation of Candida. Mercury impairs the bodyâ??s ability to kill Candida albicans by impairment with the lytic activity of neutrophils and myeloperoxidase with workers in whose mercury removal levels are within current safety limits. Immune Th1 skin cells inhibit Candida by cytokine related activation involving macrophages together with neutrophils. Development of Th2 type immune responses deactivate such defences. Mercury inhibits macrophage and neutrophil support against Candida by its affects with Th1 together with Th2 cytokine effects. Candida additionally methylates inorganic mercury on the highly poisonous chemicals methyl mercury mode which enjoy mercury fumes readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, causes neurological damage, and weakens the immune system. Candidiasis is often observed with immuno-compromised individuals which include those using toxic metal exposures, especially individuals who are found as a result of test being immune reactive to help mercury or other poisonous chemicals metals. Amalgam substitute cures and also significantly increases Candida.<br /><br />Nickel and beryllium are generally two many other metals commonly utilised in dentistry that will be very carcinogenic, hazardous, and trigger DNA malformations. Nickel ceramic capped teeth, root waterways and cavitations have also been found being a factor in some breast cancer and also other cancers and some have recovered after TDR, which includes amalgam substitute, replacement with metal crowns over amalgam, nickel crowns, extraction of root canalled teeth, and procedure of cavitations the place necessary. Dime depletes intracellular ascorbate, that leads to this inhibition with cellular hydroxylases, manifested by loosing hypoxia-inducible component (HIF)-1alpha and -2alpha hydroxylation together with hypoxia-like pressure. Proline hydroxylation is crucial for collagen and extracellular matrix assembly as well as for putting your unit together of many other protein molecules that contain collagen-like domains, including surfactants and complement. Thus, the depletion of ascorbate by chronic exposure to nickel may be deleterious with regard to lung cells and may lead to lung melanoma.<br /><br />Root waterways and cavitations also facilitate tumor by impact on immune system. As more information is accumulated it is apparent that these areas (cuboid bone cavitations) associated with chronic infection in the craniofacial area are very real along with the probable trigger of multiple distressing conditions in the head, neck of the guitar and the teeth area. This is due in part to your progressive decrease of vascularity inside jaw bone tissues and linked structures. This permits the pathogenic anaerobic microbial human population to are in existence and generate a chronic infected, inflamed vicinity. This vicinity is properly isolated in the circulatory process which strengthens delivering any anti-microbial medications to your infected vicinity. These different types of bone cavities are also shown to own accumulations of toxic serious metals, along with the pathogenic microorganisms. There have been considerable amounts of cases noted of treatment from cancer after coping with oral infections which include root canals and cavitations.<br /><br />Prostate cancer may be the most regularly diagnosed melanoma in men in the us. Over more than 200, 000 new prostate tumor cases are generally diagnosed on a yearly basis, constituting about 30% of new male cancer cases, and a lot more than 40, 000 males die in the disease annually. Both breast cancer and prostate melanoma are hormonally receptive, containing oestrogen, androgen, together with progesterone receptors. Genetic susceptibility and environmental factors that showcase the line that ends in clinical prostate cancer have been completely found to become factors in prostate melanoma, with green factors being the bigger with exposures with early lifestyle facilitating in the future effects. Low-level developmental exposures to substances that will modulate endocrine activity may have life-long impacts if the exposure occurs during window(s) involving unique weakness.<br /><br />Cadmium and arsenic are generally known human carcinogens and are linked to help prostate &amp; breast area cancer with epidemiologic together with laboratory animal studies. Cadmium together with arsenic are also found being associated with lung tumor. Food, cigarette smoke, and well water are generally 3 options for cadmium exposure. Selenium (Ze) in the large-scale people supplementation trial has been shown to significantly slow up the incidence with prostate tumor in elderly men. Because selenium may interact using cadmium (Dvd), many experts have suggested which its melanoma protective action may be attributable in part to its interaction using cadmium. The too much accumulation associated with cadmium in the prostates involving smokers and sub-optimal selenium intakes could explain why smokers create more ambitious and lethal forms of prostate cancer than non-smokers. Toxic metals such as mercury, guide, cadmium, and nickel have been completely found to market prostate tumor, and limiting toxic metal exposures together with detoxification using nutritional support have been found to help cure or trigger significant improvement inside condition.<br /><br />Dietary factors like consumption amount of red meats and environment exposures to help oestrogenic chemicals have been found to increase the occurrence of either prostate together with breast melanoma. Many work-related studies show a heightened incidence of prostate melanoma incidence and/or fatality among farmers and pesticide applicators. One in vitro examine of human prostate tumor cells confirmed that a few organochlorine pesticides, some sort of pyrethroid, and then a fungicide just about every caused expansion of androgen-dependent melanoma cells. An additional â??environmental oestrogenâ??, bisphenol Some sort of (BPA-a portion of epoxy resins, polycarbonate cheap, and dental sealants to the fact that general population is exposed at low levels), has been found to help affect your prostate and be related to development with prostate melanoma.<br /><br />The poisonous chemicals metals mercury, lead, cadmium, office assistant, cobalt, dime, lead, aluminium, and tin are generally found to own reproductive and endocrine system disrupting side effects, as properly as synergistic side effects. The ability of precious metals to set off oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) had been measured in the human teat cancer mobile line, MCF-7. Much like oestradiol, treatment associated with cells while using the divalent precious metals copper, cobalt, nickel, lead, mercury, container, and chromium or along with the metal anion vanadate stimulated cell proliferation; by debbie 6, there was a 2- to 5-fold improve in cell number.<br /><br />The metals also decreased the concentration of ERalpha health proteins and mRNA just by 40-60% and induced expression in the oestrogen-regulated family genes progesterone receptor together with pS2 by1. 6- to help 4-fold. Additionally, there had been a 2- to help 4-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity after treatment while using the metals within COS-1 cells transiently cotransfected with the wild-type receptor together with an oestrogen-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene.<br /><br />The ability of this metals to enhance gene phrase was impeded by an antioestrogen, suggesting that activity these compounds is actually mediated as a result of ERalpha. Aluminium by means of aluminium chloride and aluminium chlorhydrate, which might be used in antiperspirants, can interfere with the purpose of oestrogen receptors involving MCF7 people breast cancer cells both in terms of ligand binding and in terms of oestrogen-regulated reporter gene expression.

Whilst we are all exposed to a perplexing array of toxins, mercury is uniquely and potently toxic in humans. <br /><br />The horse’s mouth<br />I can state this with some confidence because I had chronic mercury poisoning myself as a result of personal and both occupational and accidental exposure to mercury as a dentist. I managed to recover and retrained as a naturopath where I realised to my dismay that 100% of the sick people I saw tested positive for chronic mercury poisoning (when you knew how to elicit it).<br /><br />Sources of mercury<br />Many people have some exposure to mercury through eating some kinds of fish and most will have had vaccination(s) containing a mercury preservative. However, for most people up to 90% of their mercury exposure has been determined by the World Health Organisation to originate from their &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url].<br /><br />How so?<br />Dental amalgam is a mixture of approximately half liquid mercury and half powdered silver, copper, tin and zinc. In addition to mercury evaporating from the filling, the different metals are believed to become electrically active emitting plumes of mercury vapour throughout the life of the filling. The Smoking Tooth Video video available to view on the video hub at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com</a> (go to Resources &gt; Video &gt; Mercury &amp; Dentistry or available on Youtube) graphicallly demonstrates this.<br /><br />Making a bad situation worse<br />This effect is made worse by the inclusion of other dissimilar metals in the mouth in the form of gold or precious metal crowns, posts or dentures, for example. The universal introduction in the 1970s of so-called high-copper dental amalgam has also been shown to emit over 50 times the mercury vapour of the older formulations of amalgam and may, in large part, account for the sudden and massive growth in ‘mystery’ illnesses such as autoimmunity.<br /><br />How can that be?<br />Dental amalgam fiillings have been used for nearly 190 years and were developed long before any safety checks were ever required. There were no immediately apparent problems and so the situation has been allowed to continue. Dental amalgam fillings are also classified as prostheses (along with prescription glasses, for example) and so have never been required undergo the rigorous testing that you might expect and would certainly never pass any safety tests were they introduced today.<br /><br />Slowly, but surely<br />Removing or placing a dental amalgam filling has long been recognised to increase blood mercury levels for months afterwards. This was always thought to indicate the time it took to excrete this highly potent toxin. However, this period is now thought to indicate the time it takes for the body to store this poisonous substance rather than excrete it.<br /><br />No way out<br />Mercury significantly and rapidly compromises the ability to excrete toxins through the two main routes of excretion – the kidneys (as urine) and the liver (as bile in the faeces). The mercury then accumulates in the body where it compromises all sorts of biochemical pathways including oxygen transport and energy production.<br /><br />Mercury is stored in the endocrine system (eg: thyroid gland); the muscles and joints (where it causes pain and stiffness) and the digestive and reproductive systems – causing all sorts of mayhem. As mercury accumulates, it is absorbed into the nerves that serve these organs and ultimately tracks inward to end up in the brain and central nervous system.<br /><br />Why hasn’t the link been noticed?<br />There are many reasons, but three stand out. First, there may be a considerable delay between any dental treatment and the onset of symptoms. Second, no two people store mercury in quite the same way and so the symptoms masquerade as thousands of seemingly diverse disorders. Finally, there are a lot of professional reputations and a lot of big business money at stake. <br /><br />The onset of fatigue syndromes<br />Sometimes, the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome, M.E, fibromyalgia or autoimmune disease can appear to be fairly sudden, for instance, after an infection or vaccination. Frequently, however, the descent into illness is gradual. The first symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are often feeling non-specifically awful (flu-like symptoms); feeling tearful, unhappy and depressed (for no particular reason); digestive upsets; the need to urinate frequently and a growing insomnia.<br /><br />The chronic mercury poisoning also adversely affects short-term memory and cognitive function. The affected individual may become clumsy and start to withdraw and feel easily overwhelmed – as though everything is an enormous effort. In both men and women reproductive and hormonal functions are profoundly affected. Since women bind mercury at twice the rate of men, this may account for the greater prevalence of fatigue syndromes in women.<br /><br />No defence<br />Chronic mercury poisoning also undermines the immune system to the point where the individual cannot mount an effective response to any microbes they encounter. This means that they frequently have several latent viral and bacterial infections and almost universally have ongoing problems with yeast overgrowth (thrush/’leaky gut’).<br /><br />The reality of fatigue syndromes<br />The symptoms of fatigue syndromes fluctuate as the toxins are moved from one body part to another and this is confusing for the sufferer and anyone else involved. Frequently the fatigue syndrome sufferer may have ‘good’ days when they can get quite a lot done followed by unpredictable ‘bad’ days when they may feel dreadful.<br /><br />Why doctor’s tests are often negative<br />This is a frequent finding in fatigue syndromes for all sorts of complex reasons. However, in brief: the medical profession are not conducting meaningful tests, because they don’t understand the cause. Also, even if they were to test for circulating toxic metals in general and mercury in particular, the body has often safely ‘stored’ this highly poisonous substance in deep body compartments where it is hard to detect.<br /><br />The only tests that ultimately might be of value are either provocation tests where chelating agents are taken to draw the toxins out of storage combined with urine or blood analysis – or the unpleasant option of a kidney or brain biopsy that is sent for toxicological analysis.<br /><br />Recovery IS possible<br />The good news is that your friend, colleague or family member can recover from this debilitating illness. The bad news is that it is going to take years, require a good deal of determination, cost a substantial amount of money – and they are going to require all the support they can get. <br /><br />It is truly impossible to make someone understand the nightmarish experience of living with these conditions since it affects the brain and mood it fundamentally attacks the very fibre of what you consider to be ‘self’ in addition to the ever-changing unpleasant physical roster of symptoms.<br /><br />What you can do to help<br />The vast majority of partners, friends and family members may speculate about the reality of fatigue syndromes. This is partly because of the doubt cast by the medical profession, who incidentally, termed the earliest cases of multiple sclerosis ‘faker’s disease’! Fatigue syndrome sufferers frequently end up losing their job(s), may be denied benefits or insurance, and may also end up losing their friends and families too.<br /><br />The most important thing that you can do is believe that the person who gave you this is probably very sick – albeit with an ‘invisible illness’ that conventional medicine cannot detect and does not (yet) recognise and offer to support them in whatever way is possible.

The universal introduction in the 1970s of so-called high-copper dental amalgam has also been shown to emit over 50 times the mercury vapour of the older formulations of amalgam and may, in large part, account for the sudden and massive growth in ‘mystery’ illnesses such as autoimmunity.<br /><br />How can that be?<br />Dental amalgam fiillings have been used for nearly 190 years and were developed long before any safety checks were ever required. There were no immediately apparent problems and so the situation has been allowed to continue. Dental amalgam fillings are also classified as prostheses (along with prescription glasses, for example) and so have never been required undergo the rigorous testing that you might expect and would certainly never pass any safety tests were they introduced today.<br /><br />Slowly, but surely<br />Removing or placing a dental amalgam filling has long been recognised to increase blood mercury levels for months afterwards. This was always thought to indicate the time it took to excrete this highly potent toxin. However, this period is now thought to indicate the time it takes for the body to store this poisonous substance rather than excrete it.<br /><br />No way out<br />Mercury significantly and rapidly compromises the ability to excrete toxins through the two main routes of excretion – the kidneys (as urine) and the liver (as bile in the faeces). The mercury then accumulates in the body where it compromises all sorts of biochemical pathways including oxygen transport and energy production.<br /><br />Mercury is stored in the endocrine system (eg: thyroid gland); the muscles and joints (where it causes pain and stiffness) and the digestive and reproductive systems – causing all sorts of mayhem. As mercury accumulates, it is absorbed into the nerves that serve these organs and ultimately tracks inward to end up in the brain and central nervous system.<br /><br />Why hasn’t the link been noticed?<br />There are many reasons, but three stand out. First, there may be a considerable delay between any dental treatment and the onset of symptoms. Second, no two people store mercury in quite the same way and so the symptoms masquerade as thousands of seemingly diverse disorders. Finally, there are a lot of professional reputations and a lot of big business money at stake. <br /><br />The onset of fatigue syndromes<br />Sometimes, the onset of chronic fatigue syndrome, M.E, fibromyalgia or autoimmune disease can appear to be fairly sudden, for instance, after an infection or vaccination. Frequently, however, the descent into illness is gradual. The first symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are often feeling non-specifically awful (flu-like symptoms); feeling tearful, unhappy and depressed (for no particular reason); digestive upsets; the need to urinate frequently and a growing insomnia.<br /><br />The chronic mercury poisoning also adversely affects short-term memory and cognitive function. The affected individual may become clumsy and start to withdraw and feel easily overwhelmed – as though everything is an enormous effort. In both men and women reproductive and hormonal functions are profoundly affected. Since women bind mercury at twice the rate of men, this may account for the greater prevalence of fatigue syndromes in women.<br /><br />No defence<br />Chronic mercury poisoning also undermines the immune system to the point where the individual cannot mount an effective response to any microbes they encounter. This means that they frequently have several latent viral and bacterial infections and almost universally have ongoing problems with yeast overgrowth (thrush/’leaky gut’).<br /><br />The reality of fatigue syndromes<br />The symptoms of fatigue syndromes fluctuate as the toxins are moved from one body part to another and this is confusing for the sufferer and anyone else involved. Frequently the fatigue syndrome sufferer may have ‘good’ days when they can get quite a lot done followed by unpredictable ‘bad’ days when they may feel dreadful.<br /><br />Why doctor’s tests are often negative<br />This is a frequent finding in fatigue syndromes for all sorts of complex reasons. However, in brief: the medical profession are not conducting meaningful tests, because they don’t understand the cause. Also, even if they were to test for circulating toxic metals in general and mercury in particular, the body has often safely ‘stored’ this highly poisonous substance in deep body compartments where it is hard to detect.<br /><br />The only tests that ultimately might be of value are either provocation tests where chelating agents are taken to draw the toxins out of storage combined with urine or blood analysis – or the unpleasant option of a kidney or brain biopsy that is sent for toxicological analysis.<br /><br />Recovery IS possible<br />The good news is that your friend, colleague or family member can recover from this debilitating illness. The bad news is that it is going to take years, require a good deal of determination, cost a substantial amount of money – and they are going to require all the support they can get. <br /><br />It is truly impossible to make someone understand the nightmarish experience of living with these conditions since it affects the brain and mood it fundamentally attacks the very fibre of what you consider to be ‘self’ in addition to the ever-changing unpleasant physical roster of symptoms.<br /><br />What you can do to help<br />The vast majority of partners, friends and family members may speculate about the reality of fatigue syndromes. This is partly because of the doubt cast by the medical profession, who incidentally, termed the earliest cases of multiple sclerosis ‘faker’s disease’! Fatigue syndrome sufferers frequently end up losing their job(s), may be denied benefits or insurance, and may also end up losing their friends and families too.<br /><br />The most important thing that you can do is believe that the person who gave you this is probably very sick – albeit with an ‘invisible illness’ that conventional medicine cannot detect and does not (yet) recognise and offer to support them in whatever way is possible.

The main causes include mercury (from amalgam fillings) and infections from root-canalled teeth (most are infected) and from cavitations (chronically infected tooth extractions sites or root-canal sites), as well as gingivitis and periodontitis (infected gums).  Oral infections have been found to be factors in such conditions as cardiovascular disease, heart conditions, stroke and arthritis.<br /><br />Extremely high levels of &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] have been found to accumulate in the gums, oral mucosa, and saliva of those with &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] or metal crowns over amalgam – causing chronic oral conditions and distribution of mercury to all organs of the body through the blood. Mercury, root-canalled teeth, and cavitations are  common causes of chronic conditions (documentation below), and most with many chronic conditions such as CFS, Fibromyalgia, MS, depression and oral conditions  recover when they deal with whichever of these is affecting them.  <br /><br />The majority (over 50%) of wisdom tooth extraction sites have cavitations – which can be extremely toxic systemically and cause disabling conditions like cancer, CFS, MS, ALS, Parkinson’s, Rheumatoid Arthritis and cardiovascular disease. The majority of root-canalled teeth likewise accumulate bacteria and become toxic over time, causing the same kinds of conditions.<br /><br />Dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury in most people with mercury amalgam fillings. Most with several amalgam dental fillings or metal crowns over amalgam get mercury exposure above the government health guidelines and are affected over time, which commonly causes or is a major factor in such conditions. Some are more susceptible than others and are more seriously affected or sooner affected, but all who have them are affected to some measurable degree by these over time. Tests are now available for measuring exposure and effects such as immune reactivity, metabolic effects, enzymatic blockages, improperly functioning detoxification pathways and mineral imbalances, which are factors in these conditions.<br /><br />In surgical clinical trials of FDA and medical school, approximately 80% of wisdom tooth extraction sites were found to have cavitations (the population tested may not be exactly the same as the general population but was a large population). Likewise FDA clinical trials by the Cavitat found similar numbers, with follow-up surgical treatment. Most such sites have cavitations – which can cause serious health effects not commonly diagnosed as to the real cause. The sites are locally relatively pain-free in many cases, but there are major systemic effects from bacterial toxins and infection. They can also cause major pain (NICO).<br /><br />Bioassay tests at the dental labs of Dr. Haley (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcorp.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.altcorp.com</a>) and Dr. Bouquet find similar high toxicity and effects in root-canalled teeth, which also are commonly found to have cavitations by methods above. Years of research by Dr. Westin Price (Dental association researcher) and prominent doctors documented the same thing. Thousands of people who have had cavitation surgery or proper extraction of root-canalled teeth have recovered from disabling chronic conditions such as the above.<br /><br />DAMS, a national patients support organisation with coordinators in most U.S. states,  works with thousands of disabled and chronically ill people each year and have compiled many thousands of cases of recovery from over 40 major chronic conditions after proper diagnosis and treatment for mercury toxicity, root canal toxicity, or cavitation toxicity.<br /><br />Over 50,000 clinical cases of recovery are documented in the first web site paper, and we and the other sources have many hundreds of cases of documented recoveries from disabling conditions after dealing with root-canalled teeth and cavitations. Any of the several oral surgeons we interact with dealing with cavitations or root-canalled teeth have had large numbers of cases of recovery from chronic or disabling conditions after treatment. Bob Jones, who invented the Cavitat, recovered from ALS after cavitation surgery, and we know of many other cases of recovery from such conditions in people DAMS has worked with.<br /><br />This is all well documented in the medical and dental literature – thousands of peer reviewed studies and tens of thousands of clinical cases document the case.

		<document id="8ed1ba35c811d42088e416a0b7a40ef3" url=""><![CDATA[A History of Medical Horrors and Mercury Toxicity<br/><br/> The following presents a by-no-means exhaustive list of some of the high (or low) points in the history of medicine.<br /><br />The barber surgeons<br /><br />Although surgery and medicine are now closely allied, it was not always thus. Although originally under the same umbrella in Ancient Greece and Rome, throughout the Renaissance and until the 18th century in Western Europe, surgery was really considered more of a trade than a profession, and surgeons were more allied with barbers than with physicians.<br /><br />In the early Middle Ages, most medical and surgical treatment was the province of the clergy, but a papal decree prohibiting priests to shed blood meant that this aspect of treatment passed to the barbers who were often attached to monasteries. Initially the priests were required to supervise treatment, such as the surgical removal of gallstones, but eventually surgery spread outside of the monasteries, especially during times of war, when military surgeons were in great demand to treat battlefield injuries.<br /><br />The publication of the book Chirurgia Magna (Great Surgery), by the French surgeon, Guy de Chauliac in 1316 marked a departure point between the barbers with little medical training and the surgeons. And in 1540 the split became final with surgeons forbidden to practice barbery and barbers not allowed to perform surgery, except for the extraction of teeth. The red and white barber's pole to this day harks back to the blood and bandages of the barber surgeons of yesteryear.<br /><br />At this time physicians were respected for their cultivation and erudition and had commensurately high incomes with their record of successful treatment definitely being considered secondary to their education. They stuck to the rigors of their training, never questioning or testing its basis in fact. <br /><br />In the mid-eighteenth century a skilled barber-surgeon seeking the prestige of the physicians led a drive for professional recognition and the Company of Surgeons was formed. This later evolved into the Royal College of Surgeons of England. <br /><br />For much of this time the treatments meted out were proportional to the fear of the diseases of the time and these are now referred to under the umbrella of 'Heroic medicine'. Therapies included bleeding, leeching, purging (either by emetic or enema), blistering, the use of medicines which we now know to have been poisonous and the induction of profuse sweating (diaphoresis). <br /><br />&quot;Their techniques were rooted in the notion that the way to exorcise one set of afflictions from a patient’s body was to subject it to a considerably more violent set of afflictions. The heroics were entirely on the part of the patient: for even the mildest ailments, one could expect to be bled, leeched, cupped, blistered, amputated, sweated, trepanned, scourged, and purged and flayed to the fare-thee-well.&quot;<br /><br />Gay Courter, Flowers in the Blood<br /><br />Humorism<br />First propounded by Ancient Greek, Roman and Islamic physicians, the theory of the four humors became the most commonly held view of the human body among European physicians right up until the nineteenth century. As determined by Hippocrates, the four humors were black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. In health these humors were considered to be balanced, but an excess or deficiency of one or more humors was considered to result in disease. <br /><br />When the Roman Empire collapsed it was replaced largely with folk medicine for many centuries until the establishment of the Salerno School of Medicine in Italy around 1,000 AD when professional medicine and the theory of the four humors re-emerged.<br /><br />&quot;The underlying theory on which much of Western medicine was based for almost a thousand years was pure bunk.&quot;<br /><br />Richard Zachs from An Underground Education<br /><br />Bloodletting<br />Of all the humors, blood was regarded as the dominant humor and the one that most needed control. They thought that blood was created and then used up so that it could stagnate in the extremities. As such, bloodletting was used to treat or prevent almost every disease. This was thought to balance the humors and was the most common medical practice performed by doctors for two thousand years!<br /><br />Galen of Greece discovered that veins as well as arteries were full of blood and not air as previously supposed. He went on to devise a complex system of how much arterial or venous blood required removal therapeutically based upon the the distance or proximity to the affected area, the severity of the condition, the patient's age, their constitution, the season, the weather and the place. The more serious the disease, the more blood was required to be let and the induction of fainting was considered beneficial. <br /><br />Bloodletting was practised all over the world and in spite of the fact that William Harvey disproved the theory that underscored bloodletting in 1628, Sir William Osler was still recommending it in his 1923 text The Principles and Practice of Medicine. Cups were sometimes used that would be placed over the site of the incision and replaced when full of blood. The use of leeches was also popular to the extent that in the 1830s that the French were importing about forty million leeches a year for medical purposes.<br /><br />Blaming deaths on the disease and crediting the physician with recovery patients were aggressively bled. One record of a French sergeant who was stabbed through the chest in 1823 reveals that the patient was bled a total of eight times over a period of 24 hours after admission, thus removing half his circulating blood. This was followed by leech treatments and more bleedings over the following day. The attending physicians credited his survival on their pro-active treatment involving draining a total of nearly 11 pints or 5 litres of blood and a further 2 pints or 1 litre through leeching.<br /><br />One of the signatories to the American Declaration of Independence, the physician Benjamin Rush, was an enthusiastic advocate of heroic medicine in general and bloodletting in particular. He is credited with killing over a thousand patients through his administration of bloodletting, blistering and administering &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] cures for people with mercury poisoning from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url]. In fact, his treatments are estimated to have single-handedly killed more people than the 1793 Yellow Fever epidemic. <br /><br />George Washington too is also believed to have been bled and poisoned to death by his physicians after they removed 1.7 litres (3 pints) of blood and not to have died from a throat infection as they reported.<br /><br />It was ultimately the educated surgeons who first called time on the practice of bloodletting considering it to be primitive and dangerous. <br /><br />Toxic medicines<br /><br />For many, many centuries mercury based medications have enjoyed a special place in the affections of physicians. The anti-depressant Blue Mass contained thousands of times the 'safe' daily dose and salves containing mercury were often applied to various sores and wounds. <br /><br />While well-intentioned, and often well-accepted by the medical community, these treatments actually did untold harm killing an incalculable number of trusting patients in the most horrific way possible.<br /><br />A century ago, opium (containing heroin) and its derivative, morphine, were widely used in medications and injections and this is evidenced by the fact that today production largely from Afghanistan is one-fifth of that a century ago in spite of widespread illegal drug abuse. <br /><br />Antimony tartrate was also used to induce vomiting, sweating and production of phlegm, and blistering agents such as Mustard Plasters (shown left) were used to aid purging. <br /><br />The tobacco smoke enema<br /><br />Various devices for blowing tobacco smoke into the unfortunate patient's rectum were devised on the basis that tobacco was seen as warming and stimulating and an antidote to cold and drowsiness. <br /><br />Tobacco smoke enemas were prescribed for a variety of abdominal and respiratory complaints, and were also used to resuscitate victims of near drowning. <br /><br />This became an established practice and was considered as important as artificial respiration to which end the UK Royal Humane Society installed smoke enema resuscitation kits along the banks of the River Thames in the 1780s. <br /><br />The practice finally fell into decline during the early 19th century when it was recognised that the nicotine in tobacco was poisonous.<br /><br />&quot;Here, therefore, I conceive it most proper to bleed first in the arm, and an hour or two afterwards to throw up a strong purging glyster; and I know of none so strong and effectual as the smoke of tobacco, forced up through a large bladder into the bowels by an inverted pipe, which may be repeated after a short interval, if the former, by giving a stool, does not open a passage downwards.&quot;<br /><br />Thomas Sydenham, 1809<br /><br />Heart transplantation<br />The South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard conducted the first heart transplant in 1967. The plumbing side of things worked, but the poor understanding of immunology at the time meant that the patient died two weeks later of double pneumonia.<br /><br />In spite of this the operation was pronounced a success and the 'pioneering work' of Christiaan Barnard was soon to be emulated by other surgeons around the world who wanted to be the first in their country or hospital to perform the procedure. The fatality rate for the first few dozen surgeries was 100%, but this did not seem to dampen their enthusiasm for the procedure. <br /><br />Sanatoria<br /><br />In the days before the advent of antibiotics, sanatoria were established all over the world as places in which the chronically ill and patients with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or leprosy could be treated.<br /><br />The sanatoria provided good nutrition and rest (nothing wrong with that), but placed a great deal of faith in the curative powers of clean air. This meant that seriously ill patients were frequently put outside - even overnight - in subzero temperatures as this picture shows. Some patients even recall waking to find their bed covered in snow if it had snowed during the night. <br /><br />The cold, clean mountain air of Switzerland was considered particularly therapeutic and many clinics with rooftop terraces were established. <br /><br />This therapy may have worked, presumably on the basis that what didn't kill you, made you strong!<br /><br />Psychiatric treatments<br />For two and a half centuries from 1700 to 1950, a variety of 'therapeutic' treatments were used on psychiatric patients. By and large the mentally ill were regarded as being subhuman and so many of the types of treatments used to tame animals were deemed appropriate. Treatments included: <br /><br />Confining patients to hollow wheels in which they could either remain stationary or run for up to 48 hours.<br />Jolting patients back to sensibility using terror to which end patients were nearly drowned while cannon were fired. <br />The American physician, Benjamin Rush, first initiated the idea that mental illness could be shaken from a person. As such he devised twirling chairs in which the patient could be spun around their own axis up to 100 times a minute in an effort to separate the humors and/or improve circulation to the brain. A variation included a board to which the patient was strapped and spun. <br />Restraining devices such as barred cribs in which the patient could not move, chains, shackles, fetters and straitjackets were frequently used. <br />The tranquilliser chair was a combination of a restraining device in which the patient was strapped to a chair and a wooden hood placed over their head so that they were also deprived of sensory input. This was said to reduce the flow of stimulating blood to the brain.<br />Water treatments of various hues included cold water douchings which were thought to control agitation and mania by slowing the metabolism. Others such as the Dutch medical teacher, Hermann Boerhaave, recommended throwing the unsuspecting patient into the sea and then keeping them under water as long as possible without actually killing them. The thinking behind these hydrotherapies was evidently based upon altering blood flows to the brain.<br /><br />Trepanning<br /><br />Trepanning, or trephining involved drilling a hole into the skull in order to treat health problems related to diseases thought to be intracranial.<br /><br />Somewhat remarkably, there is evidence of the practice in prehistoric times, pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and throughout the classical and Renaissance periods when the procedure was widely thought to cure epilepsy, migraines, and mental disorders and both Hippocrates and Galen describe the procedure.  <br /><br />The fifteenth century painter, Hieronymous Bosch, depicts the removing of the 'stone of madness' which, according to popular superstition, was a cause of mental illness, depression or stupidity. While such stones could be located anywhere in the body, they were most frequently thought to be located in the head.<br /><br />The last recorded case involved two men from Cedar City, Utah being prosecuted for performing a trepanation on an English woman with chronic fatigue syndrome and depression in 2000!  <br /><br />Lobotomy<br />A lobotomy consists of severing the connections to and from the prefrontal lobes of the brain. The first lobotomy was performed in 1935 by António Egas Moniz and he was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work. The thinking was that illnesses such as schizophrenia were due to aberrant brain circuits and that removal of these circuits would result in a cure or improvement in mental symptoms. It became a mainstream procedure for more than two decades, prescribed for a wide variety of mostly psychiatric conditions. <br /><br />Embraced enthusiastically by surgeons and psychiatrists around the world, 40,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States, 17,000 in the Great Britain, and Scandinavia proved particularly receptive lobotomising 44,000 people - 2.5 times as many people per capita as the US. Most of the treatments were of women and mentally retarded children and the operation killed about 3% of all patients, and had serious, frequent and lasting side-effects in others.<br /><br />Doctors in the Soviet Union were the first to question the procedure outlawing it in 1950, and other countries eventually followed suit until it fell from favour in the 1970s. <br /><br />Electric shock treatment<br />Now known as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), this involves the induction of a seizure by passing an electric current through the brain of a psychiatric patient for therapeutic effect.  <br /><br />It was conceived in 1938 by the Italian psychiatrist, Ugo Cerletti, when he witnessed pigs being electrocuted in the slaughterhouse prior to having their throats slit. In fact, chemical agents had been used since the 16th century to produce 'therapeutic' seizures in patients with psychiatric conditions, so that Cerletti's treatment was merely an update using the technology of the time. <br /><br />Electroconvulsive therapy was widely used throughout the middle part of the twentieth century on hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from a range of psychiatric 'disorders' including depression, mania, schizophrenia, homosexuality and truancy. The majority of such subjects have been women.<br /><br />ECT has never been demonstrated to produce any sustained benefit, with studies showing that the treatment fared no better than a sham treatment suggesting that any therapeutic effect may have been attributable to the placebo effect.<br /><br />Even in the minority of patients for whom electroconvulsive therapy appears to have been successful, there is frequently a relapse within 6 months. This results in the repeated administration of the 'treatment' where patients in the 1950s sometimes received more than 100 treatments with the types and amounts of electricity used often increasing with each therapy.   <br /><br />A small but significant number of patients die as a result of these seizures, and in cases where anaesthetics and muscle relaxants were not used and patients were strapped to the gurney, some sustained broken bones and vertebrae. <br /><br />The medical profession openly admits that the mode of action of ECT is unknown which is probably not surprising given that it also admits that it does not have any idea what causes psychiatric illness, except for their beloved and discredited 'chemical imbalance' theory.<br /><br />The long-term loss of memory and cognitive ability is a widely recognised effect of electroconvulsive therapy and somewhat shockingly, the first long-term prospective study into these effects was not conducted until 2007. It is still used today as a last ditch treatment when psychiatric patients have not responded to pharmaceutical therapy and is considered 'safe and effective' by many psychiatrists. <br /><br />Incidentally, if you think that we now have a scientific understanding of mental illness, or can now cure psychiatric illness you may be interested to watch What's Wrong With Psychiatry or Psychiatry: No Science, No Cures.<br /><br />21st century medical horrors<br />Although many of these practices may seem laughable or tragic depending upon your point of view, for most of this time the medical profession prided itself upon being scientific. Everyone knew and accepted certain things to be true which is why it took two thousand years for the theory of the four humors to be seriously questioned. <br /><br />Physicians were presumably acting on the basis that it was better to be seen to be doing something rather than nothing much of the time. And they probably earnestly believed in their therapies and the desparate patients had also invested their trust in someone they considered to be powerful and knowledgeable. In addition to which, many possibly bankrupted themselves then as now to obtain what they saw to be life-saving treatment (medical bills are currently responsible for 50% of all bankruptcies in the USA).<br /><br />In fact, the whole system rests on the unquestioning faith of the masses in the helping professions and their unswerving belief in the efficacy of their treatments. Some patients obviously managed to stage a recovery - probably in spite of their doctors concerted efforts and possibly by harnessing the placebo effect.<br /><br />The allopathic medical profession now claims legitimacy as the only credible source of treatment and, in fact, many alternatives are now outlawed such as any treatment other than chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery for the treatment of cancer. However, the profession has recently looked down and found that the foundations upon which it bases many of its treatments are looking pretty shaky and they are now involved in a scramble to legitimise treatments through 'evidence based medicine'.<br /><br />Consider, for example, the wisdom of regularly x-raying women's sensitive breast tissue in order to detect cancerous tumours early. Or the endorsement of cigarettes by the medical profession in the 1950s who not only vigorously denied any ill effects from smoking, but actually claimed that it was positively beneficial (based upon 'scientific studies' funded by the cigarette manufacturers). <br /><br />If you think the comparison of the heroic medicine practised by their forebears with 'modern' medicine is unfair, try asking an oncologist if they would submit themselves, their wife, husband or child to the surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments they enthusiastically prescribe for others. Or try posing the same question to a psychiatrist with regard to electroconvulsive therapy for a loved one.<br /><br />“In 50 years time when people realise what 21st century medicine has done - the pain and suffering it has caused driven by ignorance and greed - the medieval barber surgeons with their humors and bloodletting are going to look like Nobel laureates.”<br /><br />Tom Klaber, President of Bridge Medicine<br /><br />There was another type of medicine - natural medicine - but that was essentially taken off the playing board with the advent of organised pharmaceutical medicine in the nineteenth century. Since then we have seen at first hand the bottomless pit of human folly cynically exploited and manipulated by Big Pharma. <br /><br />And many millions are still going to their graves trusting in the treatments their doctor prescribes and the wonders of 'modern' medicine. All estimates place medical and pharmaceutical treatment as currently being one of the biggest killers in the US and some place it as the leading cause of death with over 300,000 hospital deaths per year from iatrogenic causes alone. <br /><br />&quot;Unless we put medical freedom into the constitution the time will come when medicine will organise into an undercover dictatorship and force people who wish doctors and treatment of their own choice to submit to only what the dictating outfit offers.&quot; <br /><br />Benjamin Rush, one of the first US physicians<br /><br />For their part the doctors still regard their patients as dying from their illnesses, and not from their cures. This is in spite of the lunacy of giving someone with a cancer chemotherapy drugs which wipe out their immune response and take them to the brink of death in the hope of killing the tumour before they kill the patient. <br /><br />What if, to paraphrase the former US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, allopathic medicine is wrong about the known knowns ie: the things it thinks it knows and the unknown unknowns ie: the things it doesn't know that it doesn't know?<br /><br />“The truest characters of ignorance are vanity, and pride and arrogance.”<br /><br />Samuel Butler

However, he states that as serious as this is, this is likely to affect only a small proportion of the population. Of greater concern he feels is the effect on the entire population of being subjected to whole body irradiation, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year on a scale that is of 'Biblical' proportions compared to natural background radiation levels.<br /><br />The adverse effects of EMR have been largely assumed to be related to the thermal or heating effect, but concern now centres around the nonthermal effects. These are subtle and include disruption of ionic channels (these are proteins embedded in all cell membranes which help to maintain a small voltage gradient across the plasma membrane by controlling the passage of ions) and the release, uptake and degradation of transmitters (which is how neurons communicate chemically with each other and is also governed by the balance of electrolytes). <br /><br />The nonthermal effects of electromagnetic radiation are often evident much earlier that the thermal effects - even within minutes, hours or days and include:<br /><br />A compromised immune system<br />Decreased fertility<br />Headaches<br />Decreased sleep quality and quantity<br />Compromised mental function and concentration<br />Deterioration in short term memory and<br />Decreased learning capacity.<br /><br />Professor Johansson feels that it is high time to put a 'foot on brake' of the widespread deployment of these technologies since many of the adverse effects may not be evident for generations by which time it will definitely be too late to address the problem. He admits to being surprised that politicians feel able to take chances with the health of the whole population and that by and large, the people have notably not been informed about the potential perils of these technologies.<br /><br />Since ALL of the research papers printed in peer-reviewed journals are indicating that there is a cause for concern, he requested that the former Swedish government send him the relevant scientific papers documenting the safety of EMR - and received no reply. <br /><br />The 2007 Bioinitiative Report<br />According to the industry-funded research into the safety of electromagnetic radiation, there is no risk to health whatsoever. However, Professor Johansson and others mindful of the 'tobacco science' of the 1950s were concerned about the lack of independent research and decided after one particular conference to look into the issue themselves. <br /><br />Dozens of concerned independent scientists scrutinised the 2,000 plus peer-reviewed studies which had been published on the topic and each took subjects covered by their area of expertise. The result was the 600 page Bioinitiative Report published in 2007 and available to view at: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bioinitiative.org"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.bioinitiative.org</a>. <br /><br />For his part, Professor Johansson agreed to examine the effects of EMR on the immune system and thinking this would not be a very large topic also agreed to make a study of electrohypersensitivity. He confesses that he later came to regret this action since he had not appreciated at the time the vast amount of scientific research just addressing the topic of adverse immune effects. <br /><br />What the studies show with regard to the effects of electromagnetic irradiation on the immune system is that there appears to be an initial activation of the immune system in same way as would occur with any intrusion by a foreign agent such as bacteria. However, there is then a decrease in immune activity which falls below the initial baseline suggesting that the effect of EMR exposure is long-term compromise or fatigue of the immune system. <br /><br />Cancer is ultimately regarded by many as an immune deficiency disease since the immune system has either not recognised or mounted a defence against cancerous cells and this may be the mechanism behind the link between EMR exposure and an increased incidence of various cancers.  <br /><br />Other topics examined in the Bioinitiative Report include the effects of EMR on: <br /><br />Gene and protein expression<br />Genotoxic effects ie: DNA damage<br />The stress response<br />Effects on neurology and behaviour<br />Brain tumours and acoustic neuromas<br />Childhood cancers such as leukaemia<br />Melatonin production<br />Alzheimer’s disease and<br />Breast cancer promotion. <br /><br />Tips for reducing exposure to electromagnetic radiation<br />To help you best protect yourself from EMR, Lloyd Burrell of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.electricsense.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.electricsense.com</a> offers his top video tips for protecting yourself from computer radiation as follows: <br /><br />Be aware that the radiation emitted by laptops is higher than that generated by a desktop computer and that laptop computers are best used on their battery rather than mains electricity supply.<br />Avoid using a laptop computer on your lap as the electromagnetic radiation emitted will be adjacent to your reproductive organs. He suggests a variety of protection devices including the Harapad to shield your body from the radiation.<br />Use a radiation filter over the screen on your desktop computer and ensure that the electricity supply is earthed. <br />Sit as far away as possible from the CPU.  <br />After extensive research, NASA concluded that the best device for absorbing EM radiation were Cereus cacti - preferably with 5 heads. This is thought to be because they have evolved self-protective mechanisms to defend themselves from the harsh radiation of the desert (see illustration right).  <br />The use of salt crystal lamps (see right) helps to maintain a normal ionic balance in the office.<br />Take regular breaks every 15-20 mins and look out over the horizon if possible to reduce eye strain.<br />Eat bananas which are high in potassium which helps to alleviate eye irritation.<br />Ensure you eat a diet rich in antioxidants including foods such as tomatoes, cherries and broccoli which are high in vitamins A and C which help to protect your body from the free radical damage caused by EMR.<br />Washing your face occasionally helps to remove particles of radiation which attach to the skin.<br />If you work in an office with others, then it is not just your computer that poses a risk. Depending upon the age of the equipment and the model, some of the older types of monitors emit most radiation from the rear - so avoid sitting too close to the back of anyone else's computer if possible.  <br /><br />Click to watch videos in which Lloyd demonstrates the radiation emitted by cell phones and cordless phones (where the base acts as a mini mast constantly emitting radiation) or for his tips on protecting yourself from cell phone radiation which are as follows:<br /><br />Do not let children have or use cell phones. Their organs are still developing, they are smaller, have a thinner skull and their blood-brain barrier is much more susceptible to cell phone radiation.<br />Limit cell phone conversations to a minimum.<br />Use the speaker phone as much as possible.<br />When taking or making a call do not put the cell phone to your ear until the connection has been established as the radiation is highest when the device is seeking a signal.<br />Avoid carrying your mobile phone on your body near to your heart, kidneys, or gonads.<br />Only use your cell phone in optimum reception areas (which can be judged by the number of bars depicted). Do not use in poor reception areas such as elevators or basements.<br />Do not use your cell phone in a moving vehicle as the phone will be scanning all the time for the nearest mast.<br />Do not use your phone in a car at all. The car creates a Faraday's cage or electrically insulated box and the cell phone acts as a radiation emitting device with your body acting to absorb the EMR it produces.<br />Never sleep with your cell phone switched on. In fact, do not even have it in your bedroom. Sleep is important - it is when your body recharges and repairs. <br />Avoid using a cell phone if you are ill, rundown or elderly. Pregnant women and their babies are also at higher risk since the amniotic fluid does not provide any EMF protection.<br />When buying a cell phone buy one with the lowest SRI. Although imperfect, this provides an indication of the likely amount of radiation exposure.<br />Use your cell phone to send and receive texts where possible.  <br /><br />The answer has to be to take sensible measures as outlined above and also to protect your body since electromagnetic fields are now inescapable.

That, in short, cholesterol will kill us unless vigorously suppressed.<br /><br />This notion is based upon the rather simplistic version of cardiovascular disease causation that goes something like this: The fat we eat will clog, block and dislodge from within our arteries causing strokes and heart disease.<br /><br />It sounds plausible. So plausible in fact that not only most lay people, but most doctors believe it to be true. But what if we have it all backwards? What if the big guns of pharmacology are pointing in the wrong direction whilst the real perpetrator of the massive slaughter from cardiovascular disease remains unidentified in the shadows? <br /><br />For this is exactly what I propose.<br /><br />To say that cholesterol causes heart disease is a little like saying that paramedics cause accidents. If you investigate cardiovascular disease you may well find elevated cholesterol levels in much the same way as you might find paramedics at the scene of an accident. But just like the paramedics, the cholesterol was not the cause of the event, but an attempt to rectify the situation. Trying to prevent and suppress the body's cholesterol response (because the vast majority of cholesterol is produced by the liver and is not dietary in origin) is like cordoning off accidents to prevent the appearance of paramedics when actually your efforts should be directed towards preventing the accidents themselves. <br /><br />Have we not only fingered the wrong culprit but are we effectively trying to kill the paramedic? <br /><br />Have we, in essence, got it all wrong about cardiovascular disease?<br /><br />Well, that dietary fat-cholesterol-heart disease theory of causation is the children's version in my opinion. The grown-up version is a little more complex and takes more than one sentence to explain. The rest of this article, in fact. However, I happen to believe it is the truth so the extra effort involved in understanding the causation of this disease that has a one in three chance of killing you prematurely may be well rewarded. <br /><br />What I am suggesting is that the real cause of cardiovascular disease is the chronic mercury poisoning that we mostly acquire from our dental amalgam fillings. As it happens, many of the processes that lead to cardiovascular disease were initially intended to protect us from attacks from without. However, like the Trojan horse - the problem is now within the gates and comes from the burden of toxic and heavy metals - and particularly mercury - that many of us carry. <br /><br />Whilst the medical profession openly admits that it does not understand what causes disease, it also currently refuses to accept the logical argument that ageing and disease are mostly caused by toxicity - and that with the passage of time we are all collectively becoming more toxic. This explanation accounts for the alarming rise in incidence of many conditions and the advent of so many 'new' and 'mysterious' disorders. <br /><br />It also explains why, for most people, health complaints become chronic and modern medicine has no real cures other than to suppress symptoms using pharmaceuticals - often for a lifetime. It also means that the medical profession are not even looking for the smoking gun in the right place. Tissue samples, for example, are almost never sent for toxicological analysis but this might prove a lot more illuminating than sending samples for microscopic examination. And, of course, you will never find the evidence to support the disease-is-toxicity theory if you don't actually look for it (or refuse to accept it when you do find it!).<br /><br />In order to understand the role mercury plays in cardiovascular disease causation, you first need to understand the sequence of events (as we currently understand them) that lead to the many different heart and blood vessel disorders and the terms used. Then I will briefly explore some of the evidence against the currently held cholesterol and dietary fat theory and expand upon why mercury is a more likely culprit. <br /><br />Allow me to explain.<br /><br />The current theory of cardiovascular disease causation<br />Cardiovascular disease refers to a broad church of interrelated disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels and includes atherosclerosis, angina, arteriosclerosis, thromboses, embolisms, strokes, transient ischaemic attacks, coronary artery disease and the insufficient blood supply to the lower limbs known as claudication.<br /><br />All these various manifestations of cardiovascular disease are collectively a very big problem. Together, they are the leading cause of death in most developed countries and cause a great deal of suffering and infirmity whilst treating and 'preventing' them consumes an unimaginable amount of money. <br /><br />The body cannot employ the same mode of healing that applies to a skin wound - where a scab forms and later drops off - for healing damage caused to the lining of the arteries. This is because the scab would obviously present problems within the circulation and so the body has devised a more suitable method or healing internal wounds in the blood vessel walls. The series of events goes something like this.<br /><br />1. A small tear occurs in an arterial wall. This actually happens all the time and most of the tears are probably repaired efficiently, but sometimes - possibly because of the presence of toxins, a lack of essential nutrients or stress - the damage caused outstrips the body's ability to repair the tears. <br /><br />2. As an interim measure to prevent the immediate and possibly life-threatening problem of having the affected artery rupture, the body places a sticky fatty cholesterol-containing substance (called apoliprotein A) over the wound and white blood cells also race the scene and become stuck in the sticky plug. It is the build-up of these deposits - arterial plaques - that are referred to as the disease atherosclerosis.<br /><br />3. However, this emergency plug also creates problems of its own. Its rough surface can create turbulence within the blood vessels and this can cause the red blood cells to break down and form blood clots. If some of the fat or a blood clot become dislodged from this plug they are referred to collectively as emboli. These emboli then travel within the circulation until they encounter a smaller blood vessel where they can become stuck, dramatically reducing or completely blocking the circulation to the region supplied. If the embolus is a blood clot this is referred to as a thrombus and the blockage is referred to as a thrombosis or a thromboembolism. <br /><br />If this embolism either reduces or completely severs the blood flow to a non-critical part of the brain this incident may be referred to as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) that may go largely unnoticed and if it lodges in a larger blood vessel it may be referred to as a stroke. If the embolus lodges in the lungs, it may cause the death of a region of the lungs referred to as a pulmonary embolism and if it lodges in the vessels supplying the heart it will be referred to as a coronary thrombosis or myocardial infarcation if it causes a heart attack. <br /><br />4. As red blood cells arrive at the site of the tear they release their cargo of iron and this causes free radical damage which oxidises the fatty cholesterol plug to form cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) which tear more holes in the artery lining. So like cars on the motorway piling into the back of one another the initial damage is magnified by the responses of the body to the initial trauma. <br /><br />5. The arterial plug also has the effect of reducing the space available for blood to circulate within the vessel and this is compounded by the fact that particular chemical cascades normally intended to staunch blood flow to a wound cause the artery to constrict. The combined effect of the plug and the arterial constriction is to reduce blood flow to a region and if this occurs in the coronary arteries of the heart it is referred to as coronary artery disease and the intermittent pain that accompanies the deficit is called angina.<br /><br />6. The larger arteries which receive blood directly from the heart every time it pumps are designed to rebound but can become less elastic and stiffer with age and this hardening and loss of elasticity is referred to as arteriosclerosis. Both arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis may cause an increase in blood pressure over time known referred to as hypertension.<br /><br />7. Sometimes too, the automatic regulation of the pumping of the heart can go awry and this may result in a racing heart beat and is referred to as tachycardia if permanent and palpitations if intermittent.<br /><br />The evidence against cholesterol as the cause of cardiovascular disease<br />The following anomalies represent just the tip of the iceberg of evidence that suggest that we may collectively be barking up the wrong tree when it comes suspecting cholesterol and dietary fat of being implicated in causing cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />Common sense: Nothing that we have been doing for millions of years can be the answer to a 'new' problem. <br /><br />The archaelogical evidence: The advice to reduce dietary fat and protein is not supported by the archaeological evidence which shows that our ancestors ate a diet of 90% proteins and fats up until the relatively recent advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago.<br /><br />Epidemiological evidence: A great many epidemiological studies show that there is no relationship between the amount or type of fat consumed and the incidence of cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />The results of rationing: Heart disease rates tripled during the 12 years of rationing imposed on the UK during World War II when the amounts of fat and protein in the diet were severely restricted - much in line with current dietary advice.<br /><br />The French Paradox: Not only do the French eat more saturated fat, drink more alcohol, smoke more and exercise less than people almost anywhere else - they also have a quarter of the cardiovascular disease rates found in the rest of Europe.<br /><br />The categorisation of disease: Debate rages about whether the cardiovascular disease epidemic is new or just being documented and recognised. There were, for example, no deaths attributable to coronary artery disease prior to 1948 when the World Health Organisation declared that the disease existed. <br /><br />Diseases of modern life: Cardiovascular disease is just one of a package of chronic illnesses including gall bladder disease, tooth decay and gum disease that almost exclusively accompany the western way of living and are rarely found in indigenous peoples - irrespective of diet. This certainly suggests that our diet may have a role in a lot of our current general health and dental woes, but does not particularly implicate fats when the problems appear more general.<br /><br />The pills aren't working: It is obvious that the dietary advice we are being given isn't working as rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity continue to soar. The authorities' response to this is usually to blame individuals for their greed and sloth and many accept this admonition without question. After all, we could eat less and go to the gym more. But the populations of countries with low rates of cardiovascular disease show no evidence of consuming less food or being more active. Quite the reverse in fact (see the French paradox above). <br /><br />It makes no sense: No matter how much various authorities would like to convince you otherwise the case against cholesterol does not make sense. The vast majority of cholesterol is manufactured internally by the liver and is not consumed in the diet.  <br /><br />The biochemistry of mercury<br />Mercury has a unique and complex chemistry and to fully understand the ramifications of the effects of the many hundreds of different compounds mercury can form would require you to have a special understanding of biochemistry. Suffice it to say that mercury is rated as one of the most potent and deadly toxins known and there is no safe lower limit for exposure.<br /><br />In fact it is the complexity of its chemistry that is its strength as a poison because it can morph into any one of three basic chemical forms. The first of these is in its elemental form as a vapour or liquid, the second as an ion carrying a single positive charge (Hg+) and the third as an ion carrying two positive charges (Hg2+). <br /><br />Carrying one positive charge mercury can form inorganic complexes such as mercurous chloride (HgCl) and carrying two positive charges it can form both inorganic molecules such as mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and organic compounds such as ethyl or methyl mercury. All the forms are highly toxic and all have different properties, which is why mercury has such a devastating effect on the body. However, when converted into its organic forms, it becomes at least 100X more toxic. <br /><br />Unless, occupationally exposed to mercury, the largest source for most people has been determined to be acquired from their dental amalgam fillings. Other secondary sources include eating mercury contaminated fish and the mercury preservative, thimerasol, used in vaccinations.<br /><br />Mercury vapour is known to be emitted constantly from dental amalgam fillings because the different metals of the filling become electrically active once inserted into the moisture of the mouth and begin acting as a battery. The mercury vapour emitted is converted by the bacteria of the mouth into its organic form and also is inhaled into the lungs from where it passes rapidly into the blood stream. <br /><br />Many studies have conclusively shown that both blood and saliva levels of mercury are directly related to the number of dental amalgam filling surfaces. People with amalgam fillings have been shown to have between 4 and 10 times as much mercury in their blood as those without amalgam fillings or who have had their fillings replaced.  <br /><br />The evidence for mercury as the true cause of cardiovascular disease<br />And so to the case for heavy and toxic metals - and especially mercury from dental amalgam fillings - as the unseen cause of cardiovascular disease. The following exhibits do not comprise an exhaustive list of the evidence, but give a flavour of the issue and address the direct and indirect effects of mercury on the cardiovascular system and some of the many clinical studies that suggest a causal link.<br /><br />The direct effects of mercury on the cardiovascular system<br />The circumstantial evidence: The explosion in the rates of cardiovascular disease occurred shortly after the widespread introduction of dental amalgam and exposure to metals in everyday life (aluminium in containers, pans and deodorant for example). <br /><br />Causes oxidative stress: Heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium get you every which way when it comes to oxidative stress. They create a massive amount of free radicals (oxidative stress) and also inactivate numerous enzymes, amino acids, and the sulphur-containing antioxidants such as N acetyl choline (NAC) and ALA that normally provide a defence.<br /><br />Removed rapidly from the circulation: The body is known to store mercury deep in body compartments and this means that blood tests are not a reliable indicator of body burden. The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it may be that the body needs to remove mercury rapidly from the circulation where it is highly destructive and possibly life-threatening in favour of storage in less critical organs and tissues.  <br /><br />Accumulates in the heart: Although pure mercury vapour only lasts for a matter of seconds in the blood stream before being converted into its inorganic forms, the rate at which the blood circulates means that elemental mercury still has time to reach both the heart and the brain from its site of absorption in the lungs. The elemental form is fat soluble and so can cross the blood/brain barrier and the membrane barriers protecting the heart. Once through these membranes mercury then transforms into its insoluble inorganic state effectively shutting the door behind it. This means that it cannot then pass back through the membrane and it is in this manner that mercury is thought to preferentially accumulate in the heart and brain. The process effectively becomes a one-way system.<br /><br />Potent neurotoxic effects: Mercury is highly attracted to, and destructive of, nervous tissue. The heart has a massive complex of autonomic (automatic) nerves that control its activities and the arteries too are well supplied with autonomic nerves which control blood pressure by causing the smooth muscle in the artery walls to both contract and relax. The attraction of mercury to this nervous tissue may explain the accumulation of mercury in the heart and arteries. It may also account for the aberrant heart rate found in tachycardia and palpitations as the body loses its ability to control automatic functions effectively.<br /><br />This accumulation of mercury in the arteries may also mean that smooth muscle control of blood pressure is lost as the autonomic nerves that control this response are destroyed. The mercury that accumulates in the arteries may also account for why damage to the blood vessel lining and atheromatous plaques are found only in the arteries and not in the veins (which have little smooth muscle and controlling nerves). <br /><br />Poisons energy production: The heart has the highest demand for energy of any organ and mercury is recognised to block the enzymes involved in ATP production in the mitochondria of the cells leading to compromised function, fatigue and reduced energy levels. <br /><br />Causes direct damage: Mercury is known to damage both the myocardial and heart valves and may compromise the constant repair of the lining required.<br /><br />Depletes calcium: Mercury depletes calcium levels in the heart and this greatly inhibits the action of the enzyme (myosin ATPase) that governs the contraction of heart muscle cells. <br /><br />Promotes inflammation: The most reliable biochemical markers for cardiovascular disease include elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, homocysteine, immune cytokines, LDL cholesterol/low HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin. That is to say that cardiovascular disease is a systemic inflammatory process. <br /><br />No barriers to entry: Mercury acts upon the cells and enzymes which normally maintain the barriers of the body, meaning that no organ is protected from its ravages - including the heart.<br /><br />Causes lipid peroxidation: Mercury and other heavy and toxic metals also oxidise the fats in the body to lipid peroxides such as converting cholesterol into cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) whilst also diminishing the protective effect of fish and omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><br />Disrupts metalloenzymes: Heavy metals also disarm the body's mechanism for managing minerals and metals by displacing essential enzymes such as zinc and copper in metallothionein and reducing the effectiveness of metalloenzymes.<br /><br />Elevates hormone levels: Mercury and other heavy metals inactivate an enzyme (COMT), which results in increases in blood levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline (epinephrine, norepinephrine), and dopamine which increase blood pressure causing hypertension.<br /><br />Deranges mineral balance: Mercury also inhibits the enzyme (Na+ K+ -ATPase) involved in transporting sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes as required during the ATP activity cycle. It also causes the depletion of magnesium and the accumulation of calcium within the cells. <br /><br />Promotes heart cell death: The disruption of magnesium and calcium metabolism results in dysfunction of the mitochondria (which produce energy) and the neurotransmitter transport mechanism in addition to causing neural degeneration and premature cell death (apoptosis).<br /><br />Affects blood cell synthesis: Mercury in the bone marrow becomes incorporated into the haemoglobin of the red blood cells and also inhibits the synthesis of the constituent molecule, heme (affecting cytochrome P450). <br /><br />Reduces oxygen carrying capacity: Mercury binds to the oxygen-carrying sites in the haemoglobin molecule reducing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and the amount of oxygen available to the tissues. This may reduce blood oxygen levels by as much as half and this places an additional strain on the heart as feedback loops drive the system faster to get the oxygen required to the tissues.<br /><br />Destroys red blood cells: Mercury vapour is attracted to, and can enter, the red blood cells where - as in the brain and heart - it is converted into its inorganic form preventing exit. So it accumulates within the red blood cells and can also destroy their membranes causing rupture and the formation of blood clots (thrombi). <br /><br />The indirect effects of mercury on the cardiovascular system<br />The liver/cholesterol connection: Chronic mercury poisoning is recognised to disrupt many of the biochemical pathways in the liver and also to promote the formation of gall stones. Asymptomatic gall stones are, in fact, very common with most adults having 2,000-3,000 stones which may be calcified but mostly are accretions of fat and cholesterol. These stones block the duct system of the liver and gall bladder meaning that the cholesterol produced in the liver cannot be expelled into the small intestine to be eliminated in the stool. Poor diets lacking in fibre also mean that cholesterol is reabsorbed back into the body as it passes through the small intestine rather than being eliminated. Combining the formation of gall stones and poor elimination due to diet, cholesterol accumulates within the liver and this, in turn, means that cholesterol backs-up within the circulation. <br /><br />Neural control of the heart: Mercury also accumulates in the brain adversely affecting central nervous system control of cardiac function.<br /><br />Effects on the pineal gland: Mercury is known to accumulate in the pineal gland and to reduce amounts of the hormone, melatonin, that it produces. In addition to regulating sleep, melatonin is known to be a potent antioxidant with particular effect in the central nervous system and melatonin deficiency is related to stroke and cardiovascular damage.<br /><br />Compromised pituitary function: Mercury particularly accumulates within the pituitary gland in the base of the brain and this affects both the hormonal and nervous control of many body functions including those of the heart. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (also known as vasopressin) is one of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland and it controls blood volume by its actions upon the kidneys and blood pressure by regulating the arterioles. Blood levels of ADH are known to be related to hypertension.<br /><br />Thyroid disorders: Thyroid function is highly related to cardiovascular disease and an underactive thyroid gland (known as hypothyroidism) is known to cause elevated levels of homocysteine and cholesterol and to be related to several chronic cardiac conditions including atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Hypothyroidism often goes undetected and even at subclinical levels of thyroid function this relationship is strong and reverses with effective treatment of the underling thyroid disorder. Ultimately both the heart disease and hypothyroidism are co-morbid and caused by the same toxic agent(s).<br /><br />Compromised kidney function: The kidneys are one of the primary targets of heavy and toxic metals and accumulation especially of cadmium and mercury in the kidneys may also have a role in hypertension and sodium retention.<br /><br />Immune dysfunction: The impairment of the white blood cells and the immune response by mercury also mean that the body's ability to combat viruses and bacteria such as those that cause rheumatic heart disease is compromised.<br /><br />Gum disease: Gum disease too is known to be correlated with cardiovascular disease and is thought to have a causal relationship. However, the gum disease may just be a visible indicator of the systemic inflammatory processes that are also occurring within the heart. The bacteria fostered by gum disease may act as a 'focus of infection' with bacteria entering the circulation in the mouth to have an adverse effect upon the heart. The quantities of bacteria present in the mouth may also be a reflection of poor oral hygiene and the likely number of amalgam fillings. Finally, another mechanism could be that the greater the quantity of oral bacteria, the greater the conversion of mercury from elemental vapour into its most toxic organic form. <br /><br />Mood disorders: Both anger and depression have also been shown to be linked to the chances of developing cardiovascular disease and strokes. But this too may be comorbidity as mercury is known to cause profound depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability and an inability to control one's temper. <br /><br />The findings of clinical studies into mercury and cardiovascular disease<br />Studies confirm correlation: Many studies have shown the number of amalgam fillings to be related to various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, haemoglobin irregularities, tachycardia and chest pains. Some examples include the massive US Centre for Disease Control National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the general population in 2001 which found the number of amalgam fillings to be significantly correlated to the incidence of many serious and degenerative disorders. A 1990 US study found that people with amalgam fillings had significantly more heart-related problems than those who had healthy teeth. Another study found that individuals with amalgam fillings also exhibited the irregular heartbeats and fatigue that are typical of congestive heart failure (Sci Total Environ, 1990; 99: 23–35).<br /><br />Animal studies: Studies conducted at the University of Calgary in Canada using radioactively labelled mercury in dental amalgam fillings inserted into sheep have shown that within one month mercury was found to have accumulated in a number of organs according to the density of the tissue. The oral mercury vapour measurements were found to approximate those in humans with amalgam fillings.<br /><br />Mercury accumulation in the heart: Research conducted at the Catholic University of Rome in Italy found patients with advanced congestive heart failure to have up to 22,000 times the mercury levels in the heart of those without amalgam fillings (J Am Coll Cardiol, 1999; 33: 1578–83).<br /><br />Occupational exposure: A Soviet study of occupationally exposed workers also found mercury accumulation in the heart and its valves interfered with several aspects of cardiac function (Cardiotoxic Effects of Mercury. DHEW (NIH) Publication No 74-473, 1974; 109–34, 199–210).<br /><br />Symptoms of acute exposure: Many studies of accidental or acute exposure to mercury have reported cardiac effects such as tachycardia, high blood pressure and heart palpitations.<br /><br />Prospective studies confirm: A prospective study of Finnish men found that their consumption of fish (mostly freshwater) was the best predictor of myocardial infarction and that risk was directly related to increased consumption. Participants' fish intake also correlated with hair and urinary mercury levels (Atherosclerosis, Feb 2000; 148(2): 265-73 and others).<br /><br />Documented improvements: There are many thousands of documented cases of recovery from all sorts of cardiovascular disorders after the removal of amalgam fillings and/or effective mercury detoxification.<br /><br />The health record of dentists: Several studies including those conducted by the late Dr Jack Levenson showed that dentists and their staff have a much higher rate of cardiovascular disease and cancers of the heart than the general population (Adv Dent Res, 1992; 6: 110–3 and others).<br /><br />Is &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] the cause of cardiovascular disease?: Conclusion<br />And so I lay before you just some of the compelling evidence as I see it to overturn the cholesterol-diet-cardiovascular disease hypothesis and start treating and identifying the real villain of the peace: mercury mostly derived from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url]. Just one of the over two dozen adverse physiological effects of mercury listed could account for an increase in cardiovascular disease, but when taken together I think the evidence is compelling. <br /><br />If there is any association between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease I suggest that it is that the cholesterol is produced in response to the damage inflicted by mercury to the arteries and that - like the paramedic - it is our friend and not our foe. This perspective also means that effective treatment of cardiovascular disease would necessarily involve the careful removal of dental amalgam fillings and a heavy metal detoxification programme.

Some of the toxic elements the tests aim to detect are &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url], chlorine, iron, aluminium, arsenic, copper, lead, cadmium and nickel. <br /><br />Most analyses look at the profile of the essential minerals and toxic metals in the sample and sometimes the ratios of particular elements may also give an indirect indication of the presence of toxic metals.<br /><br />One of the great problems with testing for toxic metals is the fact that they are mistaken by the body for essential minerals such as selenium and incorporated into enzymes and proteins throughout the body. <br /><br />They also bind to specific cell organelles such as the mitochondria and to cell membrane receptors so that circulating amounts of toxic metals found in the blood are a very poor indicator of the amount of toxicity within the tissues. <br /><br />The most appropriate test to use also depends upon whether the toxin exposure is thought to be chronic or acute. If there has been a mercury spill for example, blood tests may prove to be the most pertinent test, whereas if you are testing for chronic mercury exposure from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url], hair testing may be more appropriate.<br /><br />The advantages and shortcomings of each method of testing are addressed below. <br /><br />Blood tests for toxic metals<br />An element analysis of blood examines the minerals found within the red blood cells whereas the toxic metal analysis is usually of whole blood. <br /><br />Blood tests are generally a poor measure of the levels of toxic metals found within the tissues in different organs as they only reveal what is happening outside the cell and the waste material being discarded at a particular moment in time. <br /><br />If you visualise the circulation as being the waterways within a country, the fact that a sample of water tests negative for a particular substance does not mean that it is not being stored in some facility on dry land. And so it is with the body.<br /><br />So a negative test definitely does not rule out the possibility of a specific toxicity. However, if a blood sample tests positive for a specific metal then there is likely to be a toxicity issue around at least that element.<br /><br />Hair analysis of toxic metals<br />Next to blood, hair is the second most metabolically active tissue in the body. One of the great advantages of hair analysis is that is is non-invasive, simple and does not involve a doctor and so can easily be used on children with learning disorders, for example. <br /><br />The proponents of using hair analysis claim that because the hair is made up of dead cells that have been exposed to both the internal environment of the body and to the external environment, the hair captures the exposure to minerals and toxic metals over a period of several months. <br /><br />They also claim that hair analysis more accurately reflects what is stored within the cells unlike blood testing. Hair also concentrates heavy metals several hundred fold above the concentrations found in the blood thus enabling detection of the presence of these toxic elements.<br /><br />A typical hair analysis would give profiles for metals such as antimony, arsenic, nickel, mercury, cadmium, tin, lead and aluminium, essential minerals and some other elements along with mineral and toxic metal ratios. <br /><br />In a report in 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency concluded that hair analysis is a superior method of testing for toxic metals to that of blood and urine testing. However, the American Medical Association opposes hair analysis when it is used to indicate the need for medical therapy.<br /><br />Studies have found statistically significant differences between the hair samples of healthy people and those with autism and learning disabilities, multiple sclerosis, dementia, protein deficient diets, and histories of violent criminal behaviour.<br /><br />A 1978 study found that hair samples taken from multiple sclerosis sufferers showed significant differences in levels of copper, vanadium, iodine, manganese, sulphur and selenium when compared to healthy subjects. <br /><br />However, one of the big problems with hair testing was revealed in a study conducted by Holmes at al and published in the International Journal of Toxicology in 2003. In the study, the hair samples of autistic children were compared to those of healthy subjects and to the consternation of the researchers they found that the levels of mercury in the hair samples of the autistic children was one-eighth of that found in the healthy children. <br /><br />This led to the supposition that the reason the children had autism was precisely because they were unable to excrete mercury and the same may well be true of fatigue syndrome sufferers.<br /><br />The study also gathered information from the mother about diet, dental amalgam fillings and vaccination history and found that the mothers of the autistic children had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure than the mothers of the healthy children. The amounts of mercury found in the hair samples of the healthy children correlated with the mercury exposure of the mother, but this correlation was not found in the autistic group.<br /><br />Another issue with hair analysis is that if you chemically treat your hair with perms or hair dyes, then you need to wait for at least 6 weeks after the last treatment before taking a hair sample which is ideally taken from the roots.<br /><br />Urine tests for toxic metals<br />Urine tests can be used to measure urinary excretion of minerals and toxic metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, aluminium and arsenic.<br /><br />Samples can be collected either over 6-8 hours or 24 hours with the 6-8 hour collection profiles primarily intended for those who are receiving oral or intravenous chelating agents to mobilise toxic elements from body pools. The 24-hour collection profiles give the total output of minerals and toxic elements per day.<br /><br />Provocation testing for toxic metals<br />A provocation, chelation or Kelmer challenge test needs to be performed by a physician that specialises in chelation therapy. The patient is given a chelating agent in order to mobilise heavy metals from storage in body compartments and urine samples are collected either after the provocation or before and after for analysis. <br /><br />Typically, an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) challenge has been used in lead-exposed individuals and either DMPS (2, 3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid) or DMSA in mercury-exposed subjects. <br /><br />The disadvantages to this method are that it requires a visit to a specialist physician's office, it is expensive, and there is a possibility of a reaction to the chelating drugs which are synthetic chemicals.<br /><br />Both DMSA and DMPS are chelating agents that have sulfhydryl (-SH) or thiol groups that form complexes with various heavy metals. Thiols are often referred to as mercaptans with the term being derived from the Latin mercurium captans (meaning capturing mercury) because the thiol group bonds so strongly with mercury compounds. The sulphurous thiol groups also give these substances a mildly unpleasant odour. <br /><br />DMPS is usually given by intravenous infusion whereas DMSA is generally taken orally. DMSA is considered to be much safer than DMPS because it has one-third of the toxicity and also because it is less likely to bind minerals for excretion in the urine. <br /><br />The use of oral chelating agents is generally considered to be safer because the individual can start with a low dose to test tolerance and gradually increase the dose and can also stop taking the drug if they experience a negative reaction.<br /><br />DMSA cannot cross the blood-brain barrier so will not directly clear mercury deposits from the brain. This means that using DMSA as a way of assessing the body burden of mercury has its limitations since it is not mobilising mercury from the central nervous system and brain. <br /><br />There are also concerns that DMSA can mobilise heavy metals within the blood stream from where they may further accumulate within the brain and central nervous system. Others feel that the body is constantly redistributing its toxic load and that deposits within the brain will be removed indirectly as the body burden of mercury is gradually reduced.<br /><br />In a study of former employees of a chloralkali plant for whom detailed mercury exposure histories were available, urine samples were collected before and after the administration of two fairly low doses of DMSA. The amount of urinary mercury excreted by the subjects nearly doubled after administration of the DMSA. <br /><br />However the researchers found no association between past occupational mercury exposure and the urinary excretion of mercury either before or after DMSA administration and therefore conclude that provocation urine levels were not useful as a biomarker of past mercury exposure. <br /><br />The shortcoming of this study is that it considered only occupational exposure, but of course, there are many other significant sources of mercury such as vaccinations and dental amalgam fillings (Frumkin et al, Environ. Health Perspect. 109 (2): 167–71).  <br /><br />In another experiment, healthy volunteers took fairly low doses of DMSA and urinary mercury : creatinine ratios were measured both before and 3 hours after administration. No detectable differences were found and one volunteer suffered a serious reaction to the DMSA. <br /><br />This led the authors of the study to conclude that testing using DMSA may lead to misleading diagnostic advice regarding potential mercury toxicity and can be associated with serious side-effects (Archbold et al, Ann. Clin. Biochem. 41).<br /><br />So, whilst using a provocation test probably gives a better indication of the body burden of mercury, it is not infallible and without side-effects. <br /><br />Vega and muscle testing<br />Both these techniques use homeopathic dilutions of the various toxic metals and an assessment of how these substances affect the energy flows in the meridians. In the case of muscle testing this is assessed by placed a vial in or on the subject being tested and then a kinesiologist or other therapist will assess the strength or otherwise of an indicator muscle using light pressure. <br /><br />However, because the toxic metals have bound to the tissues and often because they have been stored during periods of trauma and stress the body is not consciously aware of their presence and a special technique may be required to unlock these hidden reserves prior to effective muscle testing.<br /><br />Vega testing uses electrical measurements of the energy flows in the meridians to assess the body's reaction to a variety of toxins and potential stressors. A decreased reading when a homeopathic sample is introduced into a circuit created by the client holding a probe and the practitioner touching various acupuncture points with a test probe indicates a specific toxicity or poor tolerance to that substance. <br /><br />MELISA testing<br />The MELISA or memory lymphocyte immuno-stimulation assay is a blood test which can identify allergies to specific metals. This is useful prior to having any form of metal implant where a choice is available, but does not identify metal toxicity although allergy and toxicity may coexist. <br /><br />Final thoughts on testing for toxic metals<br />No test is 100% and all have their shortcomings with the accuracy of Vega and muscle testing being largely practitioner dependent.<br /><br />In my opinion if you are still responding positively to many of the questions asked in the Mercury Toxicity Questionnaire on page 104/105 of The Natural Recovery Plan book then you are still mercury toxic. The Full Symptom Assessment Questionnaire in The Natural Recovery Club is also intended to help you monitor your recovery as symptoms of mercury poisoning fade slowly over time with detoxification. <br /><br />Although detoxifying mercury primarily via the kidneys using chelating agents will work it places the kidneys under considerable stress and probably causes irreversible damage to the delicate mechanisms involved. Using chlorella supplements to draw toxic metals out through the intestinal lining and bile is much less dangerous as the intestine has a large surface area that is regularly replaced - unlike the kidneys.

		<document id="297bf04977606ea0bf47e128baa1d5b" url=""><![CDATA[The Stomach: Key to Health<br/><br/> The stomach is a muscular bag in the upper part of the alimentary canal that is the primary digestive organ. The naturopathic view is that most chronic illnesses originate with dysfunction of the stomach, for which reason addressing digestive problems is of the utmost importance in recovering your health. <br /><br />The function of the digestive system is to break down the complex molecules in the foods and drinks consumed and to absorb the constituent molecules that can then be used as the building blocks for all body processes. If you think of the alimentary tract as a molecular disassembly line, you may start to understand how dysfunction of the stomach sets up the rest of the digestive system for problems and how stomach problems can actually be the root cause of many seemingly unrelated ailments. <br /><br />Stomach disorders are very common with data from hospitals indicating that one in every four people suffers with some kind of chronic stomach disorder. Typical symptoms of stomach problems include nausea, vomiting, bloating, burping, cramps, abdominal pain, feeling uncomfortably full after eating modest amounts of foods and indigestion, and can cause a very poor quality of life.  <br /><br />Whether recognised or not, ineffective stomach function can cause all sorts of knock-on effects on the rest of the digestive tract, the liver, the kidneys and in the failure to supply the raw materials required to repair and maintain the body.  <br /><br />The location of the stomach<br />The stomach is located between the oesophagus (which is a muscular tube that transports masticated boli of food from the mouth through the thorax to the abdomen) and the long digestive tube that is the small intestine. It is located on the left upper part of the abdominal cavity with the top of the stomach lying against the domed diaphragm and the pancreas lying behind. <br /><br />The function of the stomach<br />Whilst the enzymatic processes of digestion begin in the mouth with the secretion of amylase which starts the digestion of carbohydrates, it is in the stomach that protein digestion begins.<br /><br />The mucosal lining of the stomach secretes the protein-digesting enzyme, pepsin, in a precursor form known as pepsinogen to prevent it digesting the stomach lining. Pepsinogen is activated by the hydrochloric acid also produced by the stomach lining to become pepsin which starts to break down proteins. The stomach contents are churned before being released as an acidic paste known as chyme into the small intestine. The combined effect of the protein-digesting enzymes and the stomach acid also serves to kill or inhibit any bacteria and parasites present in the food and drink consumed. <br /><br />The other function of the stomach is to act as a distensible storage organ which can then permit the slow release of its contents into the small intestine over a period of hours. To this end the stomach can go from an empty volume of just 50 ml to a maximum capacity of 3 litres and food can be retained in the stomach for as little as half an hour for say, an apple, up to many hours for a rich meal. <br /><br />Whilst the stomach lining is protected by mucous from being damaged by the incredibly acidic conditions in the stomach (a pH of 1, equivalent to battery acid) the small intestine has no such protection. What happens is that the pancreas produces alkaline pancreatic juice full of bicarbonates and these pour into the duodenum and neutralise the acidic stomach contents as they pass into the small intestine. <br /><br />It is now known that the stomach possesses 'taste' receptors that are sensitive to glutamates (such as MSG), glucose, carbohydrates, proteins and fats and which connect directly to the hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain via the vagus nerve. This allows the brain to link the nutritional value of foods to their tastes and also possibly to allocate incoming nutritional supplies.<br /><br />The anatomy of the stomach<br />The stomach is divided into 4 regions, each of which has specialised cells and functions. The sections are the body (corpus), the fundus (the upper curvature of the organ), the pylorus (where it joins the small intestine) and the cardiac region (where the oesophagus empties into the stomach). <br /><br />There are two rings of smooth muscle known as sphincters which prevent regurgitation of the stomach contents into the oesophagus (the oesophageal or cardiac sphincter) at the upper end and premature passage of the food into the small intestine at the bottom of the stomach (the pyloric sphincter). <br /><br />The blood supply to the stomach is complex and comes from at least five different arterial sources. The stomach is heavily supplied by two different sets of autonomic nerves which regulate its secretions and the activity of its muscles as outlined below.<br /><br />Like the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the stomach walls are made of the following layers, from innermost to outermost:<br /><br />The lining mucosa consists of an epithelium containing gastric glands and supported on a thin layer of smooth muscle.<br />The submucosa is an intermediate layer composed of fibrous connective tissue and contains a plexus of autonomic nerves known as Meissner's plexus which is responsible for controlling secretions from the mucosa.<br />The outermost layer is muscular, and unlike the rest of the digestive tract which is composed of two layers of muscle (circular and lengthwise) is composed of three (circular, lengthwise and oblique). It is the additional oblique layer which is responsible for the ability to churn the stomach contents. The middle layer of circular muscle fibres form the sphincters (valves) and an autonomic nerve plexus known as Auerbach's plexus is found between the middle and outermost longitudinal layer which controls the muscular contractions of the stomach. <br />Finally, outermost is a layer of connective tissue that runs the entire length of the alimentary tract. The large involuted sac within which the abdominal contents are contained is partly suspended from the upper surface of the stomach. <br /><br />The control of stomach function<br />The actions of the stomach are controlled jointly by the autonomic nervous system and by various digestive system hormones. These include gastrin which turn stomach function on by promoting acid and protease production and muscular churning. This hormone is produced by specialised cells within the stomach in response to distension and the presence of undigested food. Production of gastrin is turned off when the contents become sufficiently acidic (pH&lt;4) and by the hormone somatostatin.<br /><br />Other hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and enteroglucagon between them act to turn off the gastric phase of digestion (reducing churning and acid production) and to activate pancreatic and gall bladder function. <br /><br />The activities of the stomach are coordinated by the autonomic nervous system which controls secretions, muscular churning, and the regulation of the sphincters preventing back-flow and premature passage of contents into the duodenum. The autonomic nervous systems then further orchestrates the regulation of the passage of chyme and gall bladder and pancreatic gland empyting.<br /><br />Disorders of the stomach<br />Stomach ulcers<br />It had always been believed until recently that the highly acidic environment of the stomach prevented the growth of any microorganisms within. However, the work of two Australian researchers, Dr Barry Marshall and Dr Robin Warren, showed that a bacterium - Helicobacter pylori - was indeed responsible for a great many stomach disorders to the consternation of the medical community at the time. This hardy bacteria had devised ways of neutralising stomach acid thus preventing its destruction. The two researchers were subsequently awarded the Nobel prize for Medicine in 2005 for their work and Helicobacter pylori is now recognised to be the underlying cause of most cases of peptic ulcers, gastritis and stomach cancer. <br /><br />Further research has shown that half the population are infected by H. Pylori, making it the most common infection in the world. It is largely associated with deprivation and rates are higher in the developing world and in immigrant communities than in the developed world where approximately one in four people carries the infection. Although the percentage of people affected increases with age with 10% affected in early adulthood and 50% of those over the age of 60 affected, most infections are thought to be acquired in childhood. Bleeding from ulcers in the stomach or duodenum may be seen in the stool as either appearing like coffee grounds or may make the faeces dark. This occult bleeding can also lead to anaemia over time. <br /><br />A small protein molecule known as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) has been identified in saliva which appears to be controlled by dietary iodine and plays an important part in maintaining the tissues of the mouth, oesophagus and stomach. EGF promotes healing of oral and gastroesophageal ulcers, inhibits production of stomach acid, and protects the mucosa from the actions of the protein-digesting enzymes.<br /><br />The nausea often experienced as morning sickness in early pregnancy is thought to be due to the bile from the gall bladder refluxing into the stomach and may be due to an incompetent pyloric sphincter.<br /><br />Hypochlorhydria and hyperchlorhydria<br />Having too little or no hydrochloric acid in the stomach is known as hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria respectively and these are conditions which can have serious negative health impacts, although the cause may go unrecognised. Conversely, having high levels of gastric acid is called hyperchlorhydria.<br /><br />Allopathic medicine maintains that the cause of many problems such as stomach and duodenal ulcers and gastro-oesphageal reflux reflux are caused by excessive production of gastric acid ie: hyperchlorhydria and so they seek to remedy this by administering antacids. Recent research, however, indicates that the gastric mucosa which secretes gastric acid is acid-resistant.<br /><br />The natural medical world sees many stomach problems as being attributable to low stomach acid ie; hypochlorhydria. This means that food is retained and churned in the stomach for extended periods of time because the acid produced is not sufficient to activate pepsinogen and digest proteins. In fact, half of all fifty year olds are found to have insufficient stomach acid production. Signs include seeing food in the stool, feeling full and heavy for prolonged amounts of time after a modest meal, discomfort and burping due to the fermentation of foods within the stomach. <br /><br />This finding may be due to the presence of corrosion products from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] in the food eaten along with the constant swallowing of mercury-rich saliva. The presence of mercury in the stomach poisons the process of stomach acid production and the production of the hormones that control digestion in addition to causing destruction of the autonomic nerves which coordinate all the processes involved. <br /><br />The unseen effects of &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] result is the growing paralysis of the muscles of the stomach and the sphincters becoming incompetent. For the pyloric sphincter this leads to premature passage of acidic chyme into the duodenum which will not be countered by the alkaline pancreatic juice and may therefore lead to the formation of duodenal ulcers. And an incompetent cardiac sphincter leads to reflux of acidic stomach contents into the oesphagus known as gastro-oesphageal reflux (GORD or GERD).<br /><br />Another issue is that the body's main defence against the ingress of bacteria and parasites in the food and drink consumed is ineffective and this can lead to multiple bacterial and parasitic infections over time.<br /><br />Gastroparesis<br />Another increasingly common problem which is now being recognised by allopathic medicine is gastroparesis. This is a partial or total paralysis of the stomach muscles involved in churning the stomach contents resulting in food being retained in the stomach and fermenting. This is often found in patients with diabetes, cancer or those who have had a stroke. The symptoms of gastroparesis include abdominal pain, a prolonged feeling of fullness after eating, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting after eating and a loss of appetite.  <br /><br />I would suggest that this is due to paralysis of the stomach muscles caused by degeneration of the autonomic nervous supply and that this is found in patients with diabetes, cancer and strokes because these diseases too are caused by chronic mercury poisoning - that they are all signs of the same underlying problem.  <br /><br />Gastro-oesphageal/gastro-esophageal reflux <br />Gastro-oesphageal (GORD in the UK) or gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD in the US) is where the sphincter between the stomach and oesophagus has become incompetent. Symptoms include night time episodes of chest pain, a foul taste in the mouth and nausea. Prolonged GORD/GERD can result in pneumonia and a chronic cough as stomach contents are aspirated into the lungs and also in poor dental status as the teeth are dissolved by the stomach acid. <br /><br />The hydrochloric acid of the stomach acid causes chemical burns of the oesophagus and these may potentially result in the medical emergency of perforation. This may occur in people who are bulimic in addition to those who have an incompetent cardiac sphincter. The causes of this are allied to, and discussed under, hypochlorhydria (see above).<br /><br />The stomach and Traditional Chinese Medicine  <br />The stomach meridian is one of the longest meridians and it starts below the mid-point of the eye on the rim of the eye socket and loops over the side of the face and then passes down the front of the neck and torso lateral to the midline and then down the front of the leg to terminate on the second toe. In this manner a second hammer toe can indicate long-standing problems with the stomach meridian. <br /><br />The muscles associated with stomach as the pectoralis major clavicular, the neck muscles and brachioradialis. Pectoralis major clavicular lies between the clavicle and the front part of the upper arm and bends and turns the arm at the shoulder. Weakness of the neck muscles associated with the stomach meridian may account for some of the headaches and neck, shoulder and upper back pain experienced in fibromyalgia and CFS. The neck muscles are also associated with the drainage of the sinuses and scalp and so chronic sinus problems may be an indicator of poor stomach function. The brachioradialis muscle in the lower arm is also associated with the stomach meridian and this muscle is responsible for flexing the elbow and helping to turn the wrists. Weakness of this muscle makes it difficult to put your arm up and behind your back. This muscle is frequently found to be weak in people also suffering with insomnia and nervous tension.<br /><br />The neurovascular holding points (for strengthening muscles) associated with the stomach are found half-way up the forehead above the pupils of each eye and holding these points can help to strengthen the stomach meridian. You may wish to click the link to refer to an article about Simple Energy Management Techniques for more information.<br /><br />The main neurolymphatic massage points (circuit breakers for overloaded meridians) associated with the stomach are just below the breast/chest on the left hand side where an underwiring of a bra would be on a woman. This area may be tender and rubbing it will help to reset and strengthen the stomach meridian. <br /><br />The stomach is governed by the solar plexus chakra which also governs all the other organs of digestion and is associated on an emotional level with self-assertion and self-esteem. <br /><br />In TCM the stomach is associated with the emotions of: disgust, bitterness, greed, emptiness, hunger, reliability/unreliability, criticism contentment, disappointment, deprivation, nausea, sympathy, empathy and doubt. So any issues around these emotions may need to be addressed in order to achieve permanent resolution of chronic stomach problems.<br /><br />The stomach meridian is a yang meridian partnered with the yin spleen meridian. This means that under-function by the stomach meridian places strain upon the spleen meridian which governs the immune system. This is a double-bind for fatigue sufferers with compromised digestive function and immunity. <br /><br />Prevention and treatment of stomach disorders<br />Smoking is known to stimulate stomach acid production and to impair production of the protective mucous leading to the development of stomach ulcers in the majority of smokers. Excessive alcohol consumption too can cause stomach ulcers, gastritis and even stomach cancer. So, avoiding smoking and overconsumption of alcohol is a good place to start.<br /><br />Several medications are also known to potentially cause chronic stomach problems. These include aspirin and other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen which are frequently taken to manage chronic pain and can damage the stomach lining causing ulcers. Other pharmaceuticals such as narcotics can interfere with stomach emptying and cause bloating, nausea and/or vomiting. <br /><br />Advice includes taking time to chew your food properly and avoiding drinking with food as this dilutes the digestive juices. Also, try to take time out to eat and not to eat on-the-run. Supplementing with digestive enzymes acts as an interim measure to promote efficient digestion but should be avoided in anyone with a history of ulceration.

This is a simple, powerful, free and easy test to help you to help yourself back to health.<br /><br />Muscle testing and kinesiology<br />Muscle testing is the basis of kinesiology which uses light pressure applied by the therapist usually to the client's arm, but sometimes to the leg, to assess whether the individual being tested is strengthened or weakened by substances or other issues. <br /><br />This is a binary system, so that effectively only weak or strong responses are elicited. Having said that, computers work entirely on a binary system of coding (0 or 1) and we all appreciate how complex information can be transmitted using this simple system. <br /><br />Kinesiology is the art and science of muscle testing to elicit these responses to a variety of substances or emotional issues.<br /><br />DIY muscle testing<br />You can try the muscle testing technique shown in this video for yourself by using a light weight of some sort.<br /><br />Muscle testing foods <br />First, you may want to muscle test yourself to foods such as dairy products and/or wheat. Holding the weight in your hand as shown, first establish the ease and range of movement on both sides of your body whilst holding the weight. Then, with your other hand, hold the food being tested against your upper abdomen and repeat. <br /><br />If your range or ease of movement is diminished this means that the food being tested has a detrimental effect upon the biodynamic system that you know as your body. <br /><br />If your range or ease of motion is unaffected then the foodstuff probably has a neutral effect and if it is enhanced, then these foods are supportive of your health. <br /><br />This can also depend upon how the particular food has been grown, treated and stored so that apples in general may be supportive, but one particular batch may be neutral or detrimental to your health. Most people, for instance, will muscle test strong to pure water and most will muscle test weak to processed, sugary foods, margarine or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Other applications<br />Muscle testing supplements<br />You can also use this muscle testing technique to test supplements in the same way as foods and so dynamically tailor your needs on a weekly, monthly or occasional basis.<br /><br />Muscle testing appliances <br />You can expand this muscle test to include testing appliances such as your cell phone or any appliances that you keep next to the bed.<br /><br />Muscle testing locations <br />Various locations in your house or office may unknowingly be adversely affecting you and you can assess these too using this muscle test.<br /><br />Muscle testing emotional issues <br />You may also care to experiment with the emotional aspects of this muscle testing technique. Pretest as described above. Then, thinking about someone you love and/or saying their name repeat the muscle test and note the result. Then think of someone with whom you have a difficult or problematic relationship and/or say their name and repeat. You may be surprised to discover that even thinking about this person profoundly affects all your energy circuitry temporarily!<br /><br />Muscle testing dental work <br />The muscle testing technique shown can be valuable to assess which dental restorations and dental crowns (if any) might be adversely affecting your health. Systematically touch all your teeth repeating the muscle test and making a note of the responses. Please note that the responses elicited using muscle testing may be counter-intuitive so that dental restorations or dental crowns that are adversely affecting you when touched can cause an increase in strength and range of movement. <br /><br />I cannot currently offer an explanation as to why this is so, other than to suggest that when touching a problematic dental restoration or dental crown you enable a ‘dammed’ energy to flow. If no adverse mucle testing responses are elicited, then your dental restorative status and/or oral health may not be a causative issue in your chronic or fatiguing illness. However, if your muscle testing responses change dramatically on contacting individual teeth then you may need to give consideration to your oral health and/or replacing dental restorations or dental crowns at some stage in order to recover.<br /><br />How does muscle testing work?<br />As you can see, muscle testing is a valuable tool that can be used in a multiplicity of ways. How does it work? Well, I don't think anyone has the ultimate answer to that one - other than to say that it does and that the information gained from muscle testing proves to be valuable and accurate especially when assessed over time. Different explanations can be offered. All involve the meridian system used by acupuncturists which is a system of energy flows within the body that have been carefully mapped and used in the East over millennia. <br /><br />All also involve regarding the body as more than a mechanistic lump of flesh that is separate from the universe that surrounds it. Some believe that muscle testing may be accessing your vast subconscious mind, some your supraconscious mind, others the innate intelligence of your body and yet others think that this reality is a holographic simulation and that you are effectively accessing the universal database! <br /><br />Take your pick, but ultimately it doesn't matter if you find the information gained from muscle testing to be valuable and true.<br /><br />The adverse effects of dental restorations<br />The effect that dental restorations have upon the energy systems of the body may be many-fold. First, the metals used in &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam filling[/url] restorations may be toxic in and of themselves and this is certainly the case with dental amalgam which contains half liquid &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url]. There are also electrical and galvanic actions between the various different metals used in dental restorations and dental crowns which may account for some of the effect. Finally, and significantly, all the meridians flow through the teeth and implanting any form of metal dental restoration or dental crown within the body may serve to act as an efficient barrier to these meridian energy flows.<br /><br />The intelligent body<br />One thing that you do realise as a kinesiologist, is that there is no such thing as perfect health. The body is constantly dynamically responding to a whole host of influences both internal and external and there are all sorts of means of compensation built into the system. Many muscular aches and pains in the limbs, for example, are ultimately related to the function of internal organs that may be in distress and the muscles becoming tense is a ‘safety valve’ for these vital organs where function must be preserved at all costs. <br /><br />You also come to understand that the body is always doing the most intelligent and least damaging thing that it can do under any given set of circumstances, however mystifying that may seem to us at the time. Treating the symptom – in this case the muscular spasm – will do little to resolve the issue which will recur with treatment only ever providing temporary relief until the cause is identified and addressed. For example, both shoulder pain - especially on the right hand side and knee pain or stiffness may relate to underlying gall bladder problems.

Increasing incidence of inflammatory and immune reactive conditions<br /><br />The incidence of allergic and immune reactive conditions such as allergies, asthma, lupus and allergic contact disease (such as eczema and psoriasis) have been increasing rapidly in the United States over the last decade. The prevalence of asthma doubled over the last decade to approximately 31 million, 11.5% of the total population. At least 50 million have allergies (19%), and the largest increase has been in infants, with approximately 10% of infants – approximately 15 million in the U.S. with systemic eczema. Approximately 12% have had chronic sinusitis.<br /><br />Inflammation has been found to be a major factor in many chronic health conditions such as cardiovascular problems; diabetes; arthritis; depression; osteoporosis; periodontal disease; joint stiffness; chronic fatigue; fibromyalgia and age-related immune dysfunction. Many studies have found exposure to &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury poisoning[/url] and other heavy metals to be common causes of such conditions as will be shown in this paper. <br /><br />II. Oral metal exposures from dental materials and oral effects<br />Exposure to metals has been found to be one of the most common causes of allergic contact diseases (ACD) and other allergic and immune reactive conditions. One of the largest sources of exposure to the metals that will be shown to commonly cause inflammatory, immune reactive conditions is from dental metals. Having dissimilar metals in the teeth, eg: &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] (mercury, copper, tin, silver), gold alloys (gold, palladium), nickel or stainless steel crowns (nickel, cobalt) causes galvanic electrical currents, and much higher mercury vapour levels in oral air and metal levels in oral tissues. <br /><br />Government agencies and medical studies have found that the largest source of mercury exposure in most people is from dental amalgam fillings. For those with amalgam dental fillings, exposure from fillings amounts to from 50 to 90% of exposure, with the average being about 75% of total exposure. Mercury is an unusual metal commonly a liquid at room temperature and vaporising to a gas from its liquid or solid states. The studies found that mercury amalgams are unstable due to mercury's vaporisation and galvanic action, leaking mercury vapour continuously into the lungs and saliva at levels exceeding government health standards. Dental amalgam is also a major source of methyl mercury exposure for many since oral and intestinal mercury is methylised by oral bacteria and other methyl donors. The other most common sources of mercury exposure are methyl mercury from fish or mercury thimerasol from vaccines, which is a major source of exposure mostly for infants or those frequently receiving flu vaccinations. <br /><br />The amount of mercury released into saliva has been found by large studies to be about 1.5 to 1.9 micrograms per litre for each additional amalgam filling, resulting in an increase of about 1 microgram per litre in urine and even higher levels excreted in faeces. <br /><br />Average mercury levels in gum tissue near amalgam fillings are over 100 ppm, and are the result of flow of mercury into the mucous membrane because of galvanic currents with the mucous membrane serving as cathode and amalgam metals as anode. Concentrations of mercury in oral mucosa for a population of patients with 6 or more amalgam fillings taken during oral surgery were 20 times the level of controls. Amalgam also releases significant amounts of silver, tin, and copper which also have toxic effects, with organic tin compounds formed in the body being even more neurotoxic than organic mercury. <br /><br />Mercury and other metals accumulate in the oral cavity in the fibroblasts, macrophages, and multinuclear giant cells of connective tissue; in blood vessel walls; along nerve sheath fibres; in basement-membranes of mucosal epithelium; striated muscle fibres; along collagen bundles and elastic tissue; in acini of salivary glands, and in tooth roots and jaw bones. Such mercury – including that in the commonly formed amalgam tattoos – moves to other parts of the body over time in significant amounts and more rapidly than the other metals. Macrophages remove mercury by phagocytosis and the mercury moves to other parts of the body through the blood and along nerves. Oral galvanism, where electric currents caused by mixed metals in the mouth take the metals into the gums and oral mucosa, results in accumulating mercury and other dental metals at the base of teeth with large amalgam fillings or metal crowns over amalgam base. <br /><br />Such metals are documented to cause local and systemic lesions and health effects such as inflamed tissues; metal mouth; burning mouth; discomfort; tooth pain; gingivitis; oral lichen planus, and orofacial granulomatosis. Most usually improve from these conditions after removal of amalgam fillings and/or the amalgam tattoos by surgery. The high levels of accumulated mercury also are dispersed to other parts of the body. Some studies have also found persons with chronic exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) to have higher levels of mercury exposure and excretion. Such fields are known to induce current in metals and would increase the effects of galvanism.<br /><br />III. Mechanisms by which mercury and heavy metals cause chronic inflammatory conditions<br />Metals like mercury bind to SH groups (sulphhydryl) in sulphur compounds like amino acids and proteins, changing the structure of the compound that it is attached to. This often results in suppression of the immune system and in the immune systems T-cells not recognising them as appropriate nutrients and attacking them with chronic exposure resulting in autoimmunity. Such binding and autoimmune damage has also been documented in collagen. Metals, by binding to SH radicals in proteins and other such groups, can cause autoimmunity by modifying proteins which via T-cells, activate B-cells that target the altered proteins inducing autoimmunity, as well as causing aberrant MHC II expression on altered target cells. <br /><br />Mercury and other toxic metals cause release of inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFa), Interleukin-8, Interleukin-4. These will be documented to be factors in the chronic inflammatory conditions discussed here, including asthma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Scleroderma, coeliac and Crohn’s disease. Studies have demonstrated low concentrations of mercury (HgCl2), significantly enhanced chemi-luminescence, as well as stimulated H2O2 production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes). <br /><br />These studies clearly demonstrate the ability of extremely low levels of HgCl2 not only to suppress various PMN leukocyte functions involved in host defense, but also to stimulate reactive oxygen metabolism. In vivo, these HgCl2 effects would not only compromise host defense but also promote tissue injury via the local production of reactive oxygen metabolites. This has been demonstrated to increase effects of factors in cardiovascular disease and neurological disease. Melatonin, vitamin E, and vitamin C have been found to counter these adverse effects. Theaflavins from black tea, EGCG from green tea, and curcumin have also been found effective at inhibiting inflammatory effects.<br /><br />HgCl2 induces a protein kinase C-dependent Ca2+ influx through L-type calcium channels. The calcium/calcineurin-dependent pathway and protein kinase C activation are both implicated in HgCl2-induced IL-4 gene expression; and HgCl2 can activate directly protein kinase C, which is one of the main intracellular targets for HgCl2. Inorganic mercury exposure results in T-cell polyclonal activation and the expansion of pathogenic autoreactive anti-class II Th2 cells. These cells produce interleukin (IL)-4 and induce a B-cell polyclonal activation that is responsible for autoimmune disease. These effects of HgCl2 appear to be independent of antigen-specific recognition. <br /><br />Mercury from amalgam fillings has also been documented to cause proliferation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-8. IL-8 is responsible for much of the acute inflammation in inflammatory conditions such as asthma, gum disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS). Theaflavins from black tea have been found to block such effects of IL-8 and C-reactive protein (CFP), and to have beneficial effects for many inflammatory conditions such as asthma, gum disease, IBS, strokes, pancreatitis, colitis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Supplemented patients also show significantly reduced levels of the inflammation-generating transcription factor NFkB, the cytokine-generating enzyme COX-2, and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1.<br /><br />Digestive problems<br />Digestive problems are common and increase with aging, as generation of enzymes necessary for proper digestion decline and proliferation of pathogenic biological agents in the intestines increases. Such problems often decrease absorption of minerals and nutrients and cause increases in inflammatory processes. Supplementing with digestive enzymes and enteric coated probiotics such as Bacillus coagulans have been found to offer significant improvement in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, IBS, Crohn’s Disease and influenza.  <br /><br />Na+K+ATPase is a transmembrane protein that transports sodium and potassium ions across cell membranes during an activity cycle that uses the energy released by ATP hydrolysis. Mercury, nickel, aluminum, and other toxic metals are documented to inhibit Na+K+ATPase function at very low levels of exposure. Studies have found that in asthma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Scleroderma, coeliac disease, Crohn’s, disease, IBS, and eczema cases there was a reduction in serum magnesium and red blood cell (RBC) membrane Na+K+ATPase activity and an elevation in plasma serum digoxin. <br /><br />The activity of some free-radical scavenging enzymes and concentration of glutathione decreased significantly, while the concentration of serum lipid peroxidation products and nitric oxide increased. The inhibition of Na+K+ATPase can contribute to increase in intracellular calcium and decrease in magnesium, which can result in:<br /><br />1) Defective neurotransmitter transport mechanism<br /><br />2) Neuronal degeneration and apoptosis<br /><br />3) Mitochondrial dysfunction<br /><br />4) Defective golgi body function and protein processing dysfunction. <br /><br />It is documented that mercury and toxic metals are common causes of these conditions.<br /><br />Nickel, chromium &amp; cobalt<br />A study found that 39% of a group of Crohn’s disease patients tested were immune reactive to nickel. Nickel is the most common cause of ACD, approximately 20% of total Nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) and cobalt (Co) as ions and compounds, are well recognised skin sensitisers. Cobalt-positive reactions are associated with nickel sulphate and/or potassium dichromate sensitivity. In 2,594 subjects, cobalt sensitivity was seen in association with positive reactions to nickel and chromium in 95.2% of cases. Patients tested to cobalt, chromium and nickel, sensitised to any one of the metals had significantly higher odds of sensitisation to an additional metal.<br /><br />Gold<br />Gold was found to be the sixth most frequent cause of positive patch test reactions in the U.S. Similar prevalence was observed in Europe and Japan. In a large Swedish study, 8.6% of 832 patients with suspected contact allergy on routine patch testing gave a positive response with gold sodium thiosulphate (GST). Other patients with contact allergy to GST also gave positive reactions to potassium dicyanoaurate, but were negative to gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) and metallic gold. <br /><br />These findings were confirmed by another group of investigators, who found that 4.6% of 278 patients in United Kingdom had positive reactions to GST on routine testing. All of these patients were females, with a mean age of 37 years and the most frequent site of eczema was the head and neck. In Japan, 8.4% of 653 patients tested from 1990 to 2001 showed a positive reaction to gold chloride, and also in this work significantly more women (10.2%) than men (0.8%) reacted. A study by Bruze et al reported that a large percentage of the patch tests were long lasting, and 35% developed late reactions. In a number of cases, positive test sites were seen to remain negative after 3 days, but to turn positive by day 7. These findings emphasize the necessity of a second patch test reading at a distance of 1 week, at least.<br /><br />Gold salt therapy, restorative materials in dentistry, orthopaedic appliances and jewellery are the most accepted causes for gold ACD. Medical practitioners have long recognised the adverse effects, including ACD, in the risk-benefit balance of the usage of gold in anti-inflammatory therapy. In particular, an increasing incidence of delayed skin reactions has been noted since the introduction of GST and GSTM in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Allergy to gold was seen in more than 50% of patients so treated, as indicated by patch testing with GSTM. Patients developed dermatitis, stomatitis, and eosinophilia, and less commonly immune complex glomerulonephritis, lymphadenopathy, antinuclear antibody, increased serum IgE and other blood disorders.<br /><br />Gold-based dental restoration appeared to be an important risk factor for gold ACD. Several authors have found that a positive patch test to gold is significantly correlated with gold dental restorations. The saliva may slowly dissolve gold and transport it through the mucous membranes into the bloodstream and the amount of dental gold has been found to be correlated qualitatively and quantitatively to the blood level of gold. Oral lichenoid mucositis, clinically and histologically similar to oral lichen planus, were observed at sites directly adjacent to gold dental restorations.<br /><br />A study of Yiannias et al retrospectively reviewed 46 patients with oral lichenoid lesions who had also been patch tested; 2 patients who were sensitised only to gold showed marked clinical improvement with removal of their dental gold restorations. Hypersensitivity to gold has been reported in students involved in the manufacture of prosthetic materials in a dental clinic in Japan, and 3 of 12 individuals tested had positive reactions to sodium thiosulphatoaurate. Moreover, implanting a gold-plated stent seemed to represent a risk of sensitising the patients to gold. In the stent group, 45.5% of patients had a contact dermatitis to gold while in the control group, 20.0% of subjects reacted and this difference was significant. Lymphocyte proliferation in vitro shows good correlation to allergic epicutaneous test reactions to gold.<br /><br />Palladium<br />There are several reports on palladium (Pd) sensitivity associated with exposure to palladium containing dental restorations. Symptoms observed included signs of contact dermatitis, stomatitis, mucositis, and oral lichen planus. General symptoms like swelling of the lips and cheeks, dizziness, asthma, chronic urticaria, and other symptoms have also been reported. In some case reports, complaints disappeared after replacement with palladium-free (or metal-free) constructions. Another aspect of Pd2+ sensitization is its frequent specific cross-sensitisation with nickel. During a 10-year period, the trend of sensitisation to palladium in a clinic population increased to a maximum of 9.7% in the year 2000, with a higher percentage in females than in males. Of Pd-sensitised patients, 40.5% complained of hand dermatitis, 47.4% complained of body dermatitis, and 1.7% complained of burning mouth syndrome. <br /><br />The similarities in chemistry of Ni2+ and Pd2+ support the idea of a similar mechanism involving common protein binding sites and conformational alterations. A study with 10,000 participants tested with about 25 allergens, confirmed that of all patients 5.4% reacted to palladium dichloride alone, whereas all other patients also had a positive reaction to nickel sulphate.

In the spinal cord the white matter is outermost, whereas in the brain the grey matter is outermost. <br /><br />Both the spine and brain are suspended within tough meninges in cerebrospinal fluid which provides nourishment and cushioning and also receive protection from the bony vertebrae and skull respectively. <br /><br />The peripheral nerves either originate from the base of the skull (cranial nerves) or are trunked together in the spinal cord to emerge between the vertebrae. <br /><br />The central nervous system is further protected by the blood-brain barrier which is a system of tight junctions surrounding capillaries. This prevents the ingress of larger objects such as bacteria and large molecules whilst allowing the diffusion of small molecules. The cells involved in forming the barrier are also responsible for actively transporting substances such as glucose across the barrier.<br /><br />&lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]Mercury toxicity[/url] in both its organic and elemental vaporous form can pass through the blood-brain barrier and the vapour has particular access through the perforated plate in the roof of the nose. Mercury is also absorbed into and tracks up the nerves to ultimately accumulate within the brain and spinal cord where it causes conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, dementia and amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS).<br /><br />Mercury is, of course, highly neurotoxic and causes tremendous damage to brain and nerve cells. It generates massive free radical damage, depletes glutathione, kills or inhibits production of brain tubulin cells and inhibits production of neurotransmitters. Also, because mercury is able to cross the placenta, it is incorporated into the developing nervous system of the foetus to cause attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity and autism. <br /><br />The main structures of the brain are detailed below.<br /><br />The cerebrum<br />The cerebrum or cerebral cortex is the largest part of the human brain, and is associated with higher brain function such as thought and action. It has a six-layered structure with the cell bodies outermost and is thought to be a recently evolved structure.<br /><br />The cerebrum is effectively two brains - right and left brains or hemispheres - which are connected by a broad structure called the corpus callosum. This acts as an information superhighway between the two hemispheres which have different functions and is wider in women than men. <br /><br />Broadly speaking the right hemisphere is associated with creativity and synthesis and the left hemisphere is associated with language and logic.<br /><br />The cerebral cortex is highly wrinkled and this allows the brain to be more efficient, by increasing the surface area of the brain and the amount of neurons within it.  The functions of the different lobes of the brain are:<br /><br />Frontal Lobe: Reasoning, planning, speech, movement, emotions and problem solving<br /><br />Parietal Lobe: Movement, orientation, recognition and perception of stimuli<br /><br />Occipital Lobe: Sight. Mercury has been shown to accumulate here in direct proportion to the number of &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url].<br /><br />Temporal Lobe (not shown - to the side): Perception and recognition of sound, memory and speech<br /><br />The cerebellum<br />The cerebellum literally means 'little brain' and has two hemispheres and is suspended beneath the base of the cerebrum. It is highly folded and is associated with regulation and coordination of movement, posture and balance.<br /><br />The cerebellum is in evolutionary terms a more ancient structure than the cerebrum, although it is not found in reptiles. <br /><br />It is very vulnerable to decreased oxygen supplies and also preferentially accumulates mercury. Both lack of oxygen and toxicity will results in a lack of coordination and poor balance.<br /><br />The limbic system<br />This is a term which evolved before much was known about the brain and the term is derived from the Latin word limbus for border and many feel that it should now be abandoned as being meaningless. <br /><br />The limbic system, often referred to as the 'emotional brain', is found buried within the cerebrum. Like the cerebellum, the limbic system is fairly old in evolutionarily terms and is shared by reptiles and mammals.<br /><br />The limbic system is highly interconnected with the brain's pleasure centre (the nucleus accumbens), which plays a role in sexual arousal and the 'high' derived from some recreational drugs. <br /><br />In fact, a lobotomy, used until relatively recently to treat severe emotional disorders, involved severing this connection. Patients who underwent this procedure often became passive and lacked all motivation.<br /><br />The term limbic system encompasses the structures of the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus which support a variety of functions including emotion, behaviour, long term memory and smell.<br /><br />Thalamus This is a large mass of gray matter deep within the forebrain that has both sensory and motor functions. Almost all sensory information (with the exception of smell) enters this structure before being redirected to the cerebrum for which reason it is sometimes referred to as a 'relay station'. <br /><br />Hypothalamus This structure is involved in all functions involving homeostasis including maintaining blood pressure, heart rate, circadian rhythms and control of the autonomic nervous system along with other functions relating to hunger, emotion, thirst and sexual arousal. <br /><br />In addition, this little cluster of sensors controls the endocrine system via the pituitary gland which lies beneath. Mercury is known to particularly accumulate within the hypothalamus and pituitary glands leading to depression and profound effects upon the mental, emotional and physical status of the individual and this is thought to be key to fatigue syndromes. <br /><br />Amygdala This large structure lies beneath the surface of the temporal lobe and is involved in memory, emotion and fear. This structure can activate the hypothalamus.<br /><br />Hippocampus This lies within the temporal lobe and is the part of the brain which is thought to be important in converting short term memory to long-term memory - and also in spatial navigation. It is one of the areas known to be affected by mercury toxicity and is particularly implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This may account for the deterioration in memory many consider to be a normal part of ageing.<br /><br />The brain stem<br />Underneath the limbic system is the brain stem. This structure is responsible for maintaining basic vital life functions such as breathing, heartbeat and blood pressure. This is the simplest part of the brain, because reptilian brains resemble our brain stem. <br /><br />Midbrain This is involved in functions such as vision, hearing, eye movement and body movement. The front part carries a huge bundle of nerves travelling from the cerebral cortex through the brain stem which control voluntary motor function. <br /><br />Pons This is linked to the cerebellum and controls movement, posture and sensory analysis. For example, information from the ear enters the brain via the pons. It is also related to levels of consciousness and sleep. <br /><br />Medulla Oblongata This is located between the pons and spinal cord and is responsible for maintaining vital body functions, such as breathing and heart rate. <br /><br />Reticular activating system This structure contains the majority of the brain's nerve cells and acts as a filter between the vast amount of unconscious information that are constantly being processed and the relatively tiny amount which is drawn to conscious awareness. It is also involved in motivation, arousal, sleep/wake cycles, maintenance of muscle tone, heart rate, breathing and modulating perceptions of pain. Many think that dysfunction of this region may be largely responsible for many of the symptoms associated with fatigue syndromes.

More and more people are now being overwhelmed by an onslaught of toxins, such as &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] that their bodies were never designed to handle with all sorts of allopathic disease labels attributed to this one cause. <br />An estimated 5 million new chemicals have been created in the last 50 years, of which 75,000 are in regular everyday use. Only a tiny proportion of these chemicals have ever been subjected to any kind of safety testing.<br />Many of these chemicals are now unavoidable - they are in the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, the food that we eat, the various cosmetic and body care products that we apply to our skins, a variety of household products and the very fabric of the buildings in which we live and work. <br />A great many of these chemicals are fat-soluble and bio-accumulate in the fatty compartment of our bodies which includes the visceral fat around internal organs, the subcutaneous fat beneath the skin, and the cell and organelle membranes. And because humans are at the top of the food-chain and because we live for many decades, our chemical burden inevitably increases each year. <br />Many of these chemicals are also extremely persistent and their biological effects are unpredictable and not fully understood. We also know that many of these toxins are highly synergistic such that the toxic effects of any one substance can be potentiated by a factor of a hundred or more by the presence of one or more other toxins. In addition, a lot of toxins also mimic our own hormones often binding possibly irreversibly to receptor sites, thereby disrupting the delicate hormonal balance within all of us.<br />All toxicological analysis of fat biopsies reveal a variety of chemicals - it is simply unavoidable in today's world. For example, analysis of all tissue samples (blood, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, breast milk, urine, fat, etc) test positive to the ubiquitous plastic component, Bisphenol A (BPA). As a result we all carry a heavy burden of chemicals and these toxins are present in our body fat at levels comparable to the 'therapeutic' levels of drugs in our blood. <br />The average American adult is estimated to carry a body burden of lead of about 120 mg, of which more than 95% is thought to be stored in the bone. The cadmium burden is estimated to be about 30 mg and mercury to about 13 mg by a few authors - although this figure assumes that it is stored exclusively in soft tissue so the real figure is probably much higher. <br />And epidemiological studies have now firmly established a very direct relationship between the use of lead-containing paints and adverse health effects including an increased rate of nephritis some decades later. <br />Toxins from recent or acute exposures may be primarily stored in the soft tissues and organs, only being deposited in the bone as the toxicity becomes chronic. The skeleton in particular may act as a store of many heavy metals including mercury and lead, and for the most part this is asymptomatic and goes undetected - until there is an osteoporotic fracture or other symptom. <br />This means that it has now become imperative in order to regain and maintain health to be proactive and to detoxify regularly in addition to trying to prevent unnecessary and avoidable toxin exposure. This has implications not only to personal health, but with a growing understanding of foetal organs it is becoming important in order to maintain fertility and the health of future generations. <br />In addition, many fatigue sufferers may not only be reacting to chemicals in the environment, but also to endogenous chemicals produced by microorganisms within their body.<br />Symptoms of toxic overload include:<br />Fatigue <br />Headaches <br />Joint and/or muscle pain(s) <br />Sinus congestion, frequent colds and flus <br />Allergies, intolerances and chemical sensitivities <br />Hormonal problems <br />Psoriasis, eczema and other skin conditions <br />Loss of dexterity <br />Insomnia <br />Poor concentration, confusion and memory loss <br />Mood swings and changes in behaviour.<br />In order to recover, sufficient quantities of the body burden of toxins have to be detoxified and excreted in order to allow the body to re-establish some sort of homeostatic balance. This can increase tolerance when subsequently unavoidably exposed to further toxins. <br />The major routes of excretion are in the stool via the liver, in the urine via the kidneys and directly through the skin which used to be referred to historically by doctors as 'the third kidney'. The advantage of encouraging excretion of toxins through the skin by sweating is that it does not further burden the liver and kidneys which may already be overloaded. The skin also presents one of the largest organs of excretion.<br />The effectiveness of sweating for detoxification<br />Sweating can be one of the cheapest, most effective and safest ways to detoxify. Furthermore, there are historical reports of individuals recovering from the 'point of death' from chronic mercury poisoning using sweating alone which date back hundreds of years.<br />F W Sunderman monitored the mercury output of a variety of body fluids during various pharmaceutical treatments of someone suffering from acute occupational mercury poisoning. His conclusion was that 'appreciable' amounts of mercury were excreted in the sweat and the detoxification regime continued successfully without further pharmaceutical intervention by using sweating alone. <br />Dr Andy Cutler, PhD estimates that an hour or two of sauna increases mercury excretion by the same amount as 50 mg of the chelating agent, DMSA used every 4 hours for a day (and without the potential side-effects). Analysis of fat biopsies before and after sweating therapies has shown a dramatic decrease in a variety of toxins over a relatively short period of time.<br />&quot;The mean concentrations of nickel and cadmium in sweat were higher than those reported for urine; that of lead was similar to urine.&quot; <br />Cohn et al, Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1978<br />&quot;Sauna therapy of an individual with evidence of chronic mercurialism was effective at inducing a remarkable excretion of mercury via the sweat.&quot; <br />Dr. Woodhall Stopford, Industrial Exposure to Mercury, 1979 <br />&quot;The total amount of mercury excreted in the sweat during 90 minutes ranged from 50% to 90% of that found in a 16-hour composite sample of urine&quot;<br />Lovejoy et al, Mercury Study Report to Congress, 1997<br />Some practitioners suggest taking vitamin C as ascorbic acid prior to sweating as they believe it may enhance mercury excretion. This may be because it mobilises mercury from within the cells, may convert the mercuric form into elemental mercury and also because it may stimulate uptake of heavy metals in the liver thus sparing the kidneys.<br />Infrared radiation<br />Infrared rays are present in the spectrum between visible light and microwaves and are felt as heat. About half the solar radiation that reaches earth is in the form of infrared radiation. The warming infrared light towards the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum is known as far infrared (FIR) and accounts for approximately 80% of the sun's infrared radiation and that towards the cooler, ultraviolet end of the spectrum is known as near infrared radiation (NIR).<br />The Nobel prize-winner and discoverer of vitamin C, Albert Szent-Gyorgi, demonstrated that all energy from the sun has a profound effect on humans and that it can alter the body’s basic biological functions. <br />Infrared radiation warms the skin to a depth of several centimetres thus promoting the release of chemicals stored in subcutaneous tissues in sweat. The infrared portion of the sun's radiation is not thought to be damaging to the skin - it is the ultraviolet rays at the opposite end of the visible light spectrum which can cause skin damage. <br />And studies in Japan and Sweden have confirmed that not only do infrared heating systems not emit dangerous electromagnetic frequencies (EMF), but may actually protect against the negative effects of ultraviolet light.<br /><br />Infrared light as part of the electromagnetic spectrum<br />The human body generates about 50% of its energy as far infrared radiation (heat) and this stimulates the activity level of atoms increasing the metabolic exchange between blood and the tissues, promoting healing and cellular repair and helping to restore the proper function of the nervous system. In this way the body is similar to a battery that is constantly being charged and discharged.<br />The intensity of the far infrared radiation the body produces fluctuates constantly with health being associated with high FIR production and low production being associated with illness and accelerated ageing. <br />Research conducted in the 1980s by NASA investigated the effects of infrared stimulation on maintenance of cardiovascular fitness of astronauts during long space flights. Their research showed that infrared radiation has a very specific effect on the cells due to our bodies' natural response to specific near infrared wavelengths. <br />NASA identified that the mitochondria of every cell contain receptors that are specifically stimulated by near infrared wavelengths. This stimulation promotes energy (ATP) production, increases cell metabolism and protein synthesis (including collagen), and also enhances anti-oxidant activity. The net effect is to reduce inflammation and pain and promote cardiovascular health. <br />Conventional saunas<br />When the body gets hot through exercise or exposure to radiation, chemicals and toxins are released in the sweat. And since humanity evolved for millennia wearing practically no clothes under the African sun, exposure to the infrared rays of the sun may have been nature's way of naturally promoting health and detoxification. <br />It is interesting to note that multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence increases with latitude (north or south) and decreases towards the equator. This has always puzzled researchers, but may have to do with the amount of sweating individuals in these climates do naturally. <br />There is a long history in almost every culture of the use of saunas and sweating including Turkish baths, hamman and sweat lodges for health and wellbeing. <br />However, what these treatments do is to warm up the entire body so that toxins in fat deposits are mobilised into the blood stream and this may cause acute toxin loading in today's world. Some people may also struggle with breathing the hot, moist air of a conventional sauna and the extra burden that the heating and breathing hot air places on the heart. <br />The use of any kind of sauna may also serve to introduce heat into a fatigued, compromised system that may be regarded as being 'cold' in Traditional Chinese Medicine terms. <br />Infrared saunas<br />The difference between an infrared sauna and a conventional sauna is that the radiation in an infrared sauna penetrates and warms the skin without warming the intervening air. This also means that toxins are mobilised from the subcutaneous tissues directly into the sweat rather than into the circulation as with a conventional sauna. <br />Far infrared radiation also has a much greater depth of penetration within the body tissues than the heat generated by conventional saunas and is selectively absorbed by the tissues that most need a boost in their output. <br />This means that sweating is promoted without a rise in core body temperature when using a FIR sauna thus avoiding the physical stresses induced in some sick people by the additional cardiovascular strain. One study reported that there was only a 50% increase in pulse rate in a dry sauna compared to a 130% increase in a conventional 'wet' sauna. <br />Most people can also tolerate higher temperatures for longer in the dry heat of an infrared sauna compared to the moist heat of a conventional sauna. Using dry saunas also helps to overcome the problems some may experience relating to respiratory problems due to inhaling moist air and air contaminated with moulds. <br />An added advantage in many models of infrared sauna is that your head remains cool so that you are breathing room temperature air and the body is not as stressed by breathing hot or moist air. The hands can also be free in the dry environment to read. These factors make infrared saunas a gentle and comfortable way to detoxify.<br />Most of these toxins are mobilised in the sweat within a few minutes in a far infrared (FIR) sauna, so no extensive period of sweating is required. Once you are covered in a sheen of sweat, the chemicals in the subcutaneous fat will have been mobilised onto the skin. You should shower or bathe immediately to prevent the toxins drying on - and being reabsorbed into - the skin. Some of the best results are achieved from many short sessions (a couple of times a week ideally building up to once a day).<br />After each session, over a period of 24 hours, the chemicals in the subcutaneous fat redistribute from deeper tissues into more superficial layers, and the process can be repeated. In this manner, with several weeks of regular sauna treatment, toxins are drawn from deeper fat layers. <br />Far infrared saunas have been shown to produce substantial reductions in heavy metals, pesticides, and organic acids over a period of weeks and months of use. These toxins become encapsulated by clusters of water within the body and, under the influence of the far infrared radiation, the water molecules and toxins break down into smaller elements which can be easily eliminated and released in the sweat.<br />In addition to toxins however, the sweat also contains valuable minerals and water and these need to be replaced. It is important to rehydrate with either plentiful supplies of water and/or fresh vegetable/fruit juice and also to supplement minerals whilst using sauna therapy. <br />In addition far infrared energy:<br />Boosts immune function by stimulating increased production of white blood cells (leukocytes) by the bone marrow and killer T-cells by the thymus <br />Improves circulation and oxygenation of the tissues thus generally boosting function, relieving pain and stiffness, decreasing blood pressure and improving heart health <br />Promotes lymphatic drainage <br />Regenerates skin via promoting blood flow and unclogging pores <br />Has anti-microbial actions <br />Has antioxidant effects slowing ageing and protecting cells and <br />Is currently being investigated for its ability to promote healing of the brain. <br />Physicians around the world, but particularly those in Germany, Japan and Canada have been recommending the use of whole body infrared therapy for several decades. It is estimated that over 30 million people worldwide have used infrared sauna treatments to rehabilitate and treat a multitude of ailments. <br />For many people who are very toxic, their ability to sweat and detoxify through their skin is compromised. However, with regular infrared sauna use, the ability to sweat appears to become conditioned.<br />Near infrared radiation also heals and regenerates human cells and increases blood circulation promoting a healthy flow of nutrients to the skin. It also helps to unclog the pores leaving the skin fresh and glowing and is particularly used to relieve acne, eczema and psoriasis. <br />Types of infrared saunas<br />Both near and far infrared saunas come in a variety of different designs at different price points. Some of the simplest and cheapest methods involve infrared mats, blankets, cocoon/sleeping bag style set ups, lamps and arcs which can be placed around or over any part of the body. More expensive is a portable sit-in cube and most expensive are either portable wooden infrared saunas or built-in wooden saunas.<br />The cocoon is recommended for fatigue sufferers in wheelchairs who cannot manage the sit in cube arrangement and also provides 360 degree far infrared coverage. The arc and lamp can be used for deep penetration of specific areas such as arthritic conditions and diabetic ulcers.<br />Movable arc style sauna<br />Portable saunas can be packed away under a bed or in a cupboard. One of the most important aspects of using these saunas is not so much the time spent in the sauna, but the frequency with which they are used and having one in your own home makes the treatment highly accessible. <br />Treatments do not need to be terribly time consuming provided you sauna before you intend to shower or bathe. And you can read, listen to music or the radio, watch TV or simply relax or meditate whilst using many of the models. The best sort of multitasking!<br />Even if you have not been able to tolerate a conventional sauna, you may find you tolerate an infrared sauna very comfortably. Massage may also help this redistribution and mobilisation. <br />Finally, remember how important it is becoming for everyone to detoxify regularly in today's world and encourage other family members to use the sauna before they too become ill.

The gluten is recognised by the immune system of the coeliac as being a foreign protein and their intestines suffer irreversible collateral damage as a result of an 'autoimmune' reaction when they consume gluten-containing foodstuffs.<br /><br />Whilst 1% of the population are recognised to have full-blown coeliac disease, many multiples of that figure may have some lesser degree of gluten intolerance that usually goes undiagnosed but that undermines their health. This can have serious consequences and one study found a four-fold higher risk of death amongst people with undiagnosed gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Whilst screening procedures may have improved over the last 30 years, could there be another explanation for this massive rise in the incidence of coeliac disease?<br /><br />Researchers at the Mayo clinic in the USA recently analysed blood samples from Air Force recruits that had been stored since the early 1950s for gluten antibodies. They assumed that about 1% of the sample would test positive mirroring the current rate of incidence of coeliac disease.<br /><br />However, they found that the number of positive results were far smaller than expected indicating that coeliac disease was rare 60 years ago. A Mayo clinic spokesperson attributed the increase in incidence of coeliac disease to &quot;Something that has happened in a pervasive fashion from the environmental perspective”.<br /><br />So, the question is: What has happened to wheat?<br /><br />In order to understand that, first you need to understand a little about the wheat grain.<br /><br />The bit about wheat<br /><br />When being processed, the ears of wheat are first threshed to remove the wheat kernels and then milled to break up the grain into a flour.<br /><br />The outer husk of the grain which is separated out when milling white flour, is known as bran. <br /><br />The embryo portion of the wheat kernel is the wheat germ and is a concentrated source of vitamins, minerals and protein.<br /><br />The endosperm forms the majority of the grain and is a starch storage region designed to support the growth of the wheat germ. <br /><br />The unique ability of wheat to make bread is related to the type and quantity of the gluten proteins, particularly the high-molecular-weight glutenin that is found in the starchy endosperm of the seed.<br /><br />For many centuries growers have used a variety of breeding techniques to make the grain thresh and mill more easily and to increase the gluten content of the endosperm to make lighter, stickier flour products.<br /><br />Unlike many other grains, the genetics of wheat are complex with some wheat species such as einkorn having two sets of chromosomes and being referred to as diploid wheat. Some wheat such as emmer or durum wheat has four sets of chromosomes and is therefore referred to as tetraploid wheat. Whilst modern wheat and spelt have six sets of chromosomes and are referred to as hexaploid wheat. <br /><br />Work on mapping the genome of wheat is reported to be almost complete.<br /><br />A history of wheat<br />Wheat is a natural hybrid derived from cross-pollination of grains such as Triticum monococcum and Aegilops speltoides (spelt) and has become one of the biggest crops in the world along with rice and corn (maize). In terms of global human consumption, wheat is second only to rice and is the leading source of vegetable protein, having a higher protein content than other grains. <br /><br />The advent of agriculture in the Middle East using domesticated wheat allowed for the emergence of the city-state and 'civilisation' because it was one of the first crops that could be cultivated and stored on a large scale. Wheat has since been used around the world to make a variety of breads, biscuits, cookies, cakes, breakfast cereals, pastas, noodles and couscous and is also fermented to make beer and other alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />Evidence of cultivation of the more primitive grain, emmer, have been found dating back over 10,000 years to the Neolithic period. However, there is evidence of the domestication of barley dating back 25,000 years and some say that this is also likely to be true of wheat. Kamut, one of the grains from which wheat has been derived has been found in Egyptian tombs from 5,000 years ago and there is evidence of its cultivation in Northern Europe around this time also.<br /><br />Over the millennia, farmers and breeders have cross-hybridised grains to breed in qualities considered more desirable. However, formal wheat breeding began in the nineteenth century when single genetic strains were produced by selecting a single plant noted to have desirable properties.<br /><br />For example, the wheat required to make breads requires a strong, elastic gluten enabling the dough to trap carbon dioxide during the rising process. However, the gluten in pasta needs to be strong but not elastic for the production of pasta which needs to be rolled into sheets and so wheat exhibiting these properties was specifically selected and bred.<br /><br />Later, the growing understanding of Mendelian genetics led to techniques involving cross-breeding two lines and inbreeding the progeny for ten or more generations to obtain specific qualities.<br /><br />Hybridisation produced dwarf and semi-dwarf varieties in the twentieth century that had longer ears of grain, shorter stalks and that could withstand adverse climactic conditions. Such wheat has been embraced by the developing world, but has met with limited commercial success in Europe, the USA and South Africa.<br /><br />Transgenic wheat<br />However, in the last few decades techniques such as injecting genes using biolistic methods and using bacteria to transfer genetic information in agrobacterial methods have been used to produce transgenic wheat. In this manner the wheat has been genetically engineered to contain what are referred to as 'funny proteins' from a variety of plant and animal sources including the fish, flounder and the mould, ergot. <br /><br />Companies including Monsanto claim that the use of these transgenic techniques can select with more precision the traits required rather than using radiation or chemicals to induce mutations as was previously the case. <br /><br />This genetic engineering of wheat has resulted in a crop that is no longer classifiable as a plant, but is now considered a genetically modified organism (GMO). <br /><br />Wheat has been and is being engineered to: <br /><br />Produce greater yields<br />Improve quality<br />Be disease and insect resistant<br />Require less nitrogen to grow<br />Require less pesticides and herbicides<br />Increase the glutenin content<br />Be resistant to drought<br />Be tolerant of heat<br />Reduce wheat's allergenicity<br />Increase the nutritional value<br />Be resistant to aluminium contamination of the soil <br />Enhance wheat's lignans which may have anti-cancer properties and<br />Boost the human immune system using human genes!<br /><br />Whilst those who support the adoption of transgenic wheat feel that such modification is necessary to feed a growing global population, concerns about genetically engineered wheat include:<br /><br />The introduction of DNA changes in humans that no one can predict. <br />The creation of super-weeds that will be resistant to herbicides as disease-resistance is transferred between plant species.<br />The creation of super-bugs as antibiotic resistance is transferred to microorganisms.<br />Contamination of conventional or organic crops, as wheat is pollinated by the wind. In 1999 scientists in Thailand claimed to have found transgenic wheat in a grain shipment from the United States, even though at the time it had not been approved for sale and had only ever been grown in test plots.<br />The main claim is that such crops will require less pesticide, but so far this has proven unfounded and since the companies that provide the pesticides are the ones creating the transgenic crops, a conflict of interest has been observed.<br />Transgenic crops become the intellectual property of the company that created them and farmers using such crops have to agree to stringent conditions including being unable to collect the seeds to replant. Monsanto has engineered crops specifically to require the use of their fertilisers and this means that farmers in developing countries in particular can be held to ransom by large multinational corporations.    <br />Transgenic wheat produced by Monsanto is currently being grown in Argentina and the United States and has passed in-house environmental risk assessments and US government regulatory agencies have approved its use. Reception in the developed world has been cool and farmers have been concerned about the saleability of transgenic crops. This has led Monsanto to appear to have set its sights upon penetrating the developing world markets - starting with India.<br /><br />Coeliac disease and gluten intolerance<br />The first line of treatment for coeliac disease and gluten intolerance is to avoid gluten-containing grains for a lifetime. Coeliacs may also need to exercise caution when consuming non-gluten containing grains like millet and rice which can have been contaminated by being grown or processed near grains like wheat. For some gluten-intolerant people, supplementing digestive enzymes may help to break down gluten to below a safe threshold. <br /><br />The hybridisation and genetic engineering of wheat has resulted in a staggering 500 fold increase in the gluten content of modern day wheats compared to the wheat our forefathers would have known and this may be one of the prime reasons behind the massive rise in incidence of gluten intolerance and coeliac disease in recent decades. <br /><br />Some countries such as France and some manufacturers tend to use more traditional wheats and gluten content can also vary widely between products. Pizza dough for example is high in gluten, but the wheat used in cookies or biscuits is lower in gluten and you may find that you can tolerate some wheat products and not others. Trial and error or muscle testing may help to determine which foods you can consume.<br /><br />Coeliac disease and gluten intolerance are thought to be the most under diagnosed conditions in the world and symptoms include: <br /><br />Indigestion, heartburn and/or stomach aches <br />Bloating and flatulence<br />IBS-type symptoms with abdominal cramping and alternating diarrhoea and constipation<br />Anaemia ie: feeling tired and breathless<br />Loss of appetite and/or weight loss<br />Tingling and/or numbness in the hands and/or feet<br />Loss of hair<br />Muscle spasms<br />Excessive production of mucus<br />Swelling of the hands, feet, arms and/or legs<br />Confusion, poor memory and cognitive impairment<br />Fatigue,<br />Depression or irritability<br />Headaches,  <br />Muscle, joint or bone pain,<br />Skin rashes<br />Seizures and<br />Osteoporosis<br /><br />Whilst all these symptoms are attributable to gluten, wheat also contains a toxic and anti-nutritional compound known as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). According to researchers at the University of Verona in Italy, WGA can cause the intestines to absorb substances from food which would not normally enter the blood stream leading to the development of allergies and dysfunctional immune responses (Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2009 Jun).<br /><br />Other gluten-containing grains include spelt, kamut, barley, rye and in lesser amounts, oats. Whilst spelt is genetically similar to wheat it has not been subject to the amount of hybridisation and genetic manipulation seen with wheat and its proteins are also easier to digest. Whilst not suitable for coeliacs, some people may find they tolerate spelt products better than wheat and it also has a higher protein content than wheat.<br /><br />Thoughts about wheat<br />The archeological fossil record indicates that the introduction of the agrarian diet coincided with a massive decline in the health and vitality of the population. Prior to this time there was no evidence of degenerative diseases or tooth decay, but with agriculture both men and women lost considerable height which has only now been recovered after 10,000 years. There is also evidence that there was a massive increase in infant mortality at this time. So it may be that wheat - hybridised or not - was never good news for human health. <br /><br />More recent evidence supports the notion that modern ills including diabetes, obesity and heart disease have their origins in the refining of foods which has stripped out the nutrient content and created multiple mineral and vitamin deficiencies in the human population.<br /><br />There is also a significant link between &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url] largely acquired from &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url] and the development of food intolerances, particularly to gluten- and casein-containing foodstuffs. This is because mercury blocks the digestive enzymes involved. Possibly for this reason gluten intolerance appears to co-exist or play a causative role in conditions such as chronic fatigue, autism and attention deficit disorders. <br /><br />Finally, if you do choose to include wheat in your diet, use certified organic flour or organic products to avoid some of the more dubious genetic manipulations of wheat.

Some may have succumbed to - and recovered from - occupational &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2Fdepression-mercury-toxicity.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/depression-mercury-toxicity.html</a>]mercury poisoning[/url] from handling &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Famalgam-replacement.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/amalgam-replacement.html</a>]dental amalgam fillings[/url]. <br /><br />Others may have witnessed improvements in the health of patients when their dental issues were properly addressed and they avoided &lt;a href = &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com%2Farticles%2FA-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturalrecoveryplan.com/articles/A-History-of-Mercury-Poisoning.html</a>]mercury toxicity[/url]. And yet others may have had experiences through friends or close family members of the effectiveness of some of the therapies they now use.<br /><br />Most certainly aren't biological dentists to be different or awkward - they do it because they see results every day from addressing the body in this way. But many are also frightened to speak out for fear of attracting the wrong sort of attention from the governing authorities. And these fears are not unfounded. <br /><br />As you may know many naturopaths have effectively been hounded out of the continental US and operate clinics across the border in Central or South America. This is usually because their patients are recovering in ways that the allopathic cartel does not approve of!<br /><br />At present only a tiny minority of dentists truly understand the implications of the dental work they do on the general health of the individual. And the seemingly unbridgeable division between medicine and dentistry means that practically no one is joining the dots and connecting dental procedures to the medical ailments that they may cause.<br /><br />Nutrition and the mouth<br />Biological or holistic dentists usually concern themselves with the connection between dental health and nutrition. They regard dental disease as an indication of a systemic problem rather than a localised issue and seek to treat it both systemically and locally. Proper nutrition not only helps to prevent tooth decay and gum disease (and other degenerative and chronic conditions) it is also critical to the proper development of the jaws. <br /><br />For the dentition to develop properly and to be maintained in health, there is a requirement for the macrominerals calcium, phosphorous and magnesium in addition to trace minerals such as zinc, copper, manganese, and boron. Typically, these minerals are notably deficient in the modern Western diet.   <br /><br />In addition, many of the foods we eat are anti-nutrients in that minerals and vitamins are consumed in digesting them that are not rewarded by the nutritional yield of the foods eaten. This results in a negative nutrient balance over time and chronic, multiple vitamin and mineral deficiencies.<br /><br />For more about the effects of the Western diet see the articles entitled Modern Malnutrition or Book Review: Whole Body Dentistry or listen to The Nutritional Findings of Weston Price listed under Supplements &amp; Nutrition in the Audio hub.<br /><br />Tooth decay<br />Teeth aren't supposed to decay nor gums to become diseased. Dental disease is almost entirely an aberration caused by the Western diet and this was documented extensively by Dr Weston Price one hundred years ago. <br /><br />The accepted model has been for years that bacteria feed on dietary sugars and produce acids which leach minerals from the teeth. Whilst this is probably true it may not be a complete picture of the causes of decay which may actually be the end result of many different processes.<br /><br />Tooth decay is not the local problem that most dentists imagine it to be, but an indication of a systemic problem and it is this that needs to be addressed to prevent further dental and bodily disease. <br /><br />The teeth all have meridians running through them and decay can be an indication of dysfunction in the associated organ system. Conversely, any disease in or around a particular tooth, and any restorative procedures can also adversely affect the related organs via the energy meridians.<br /><br />In addition, the pH of the body has major effects upon calcium metabolism causing calcium either to be resorbed from the teeth (decay or caries) or from the non-essential bone supporting the teeth (gum disease or periodontitis).<br /><br />It is possible to reverse early stage decay and to prevent further deterioration using nutrition. For more information see the book review of Cure Tooth Decay or listen to an interview with the author, Ramiel Nagel, listed under Mercury &amp; Dentistry in the Audio Hub.  <br /><br />Minimal intervention<br />The current model of dental care leaves a lot to be desired. Once a tooth has decayed, the dentist cuts an access cavity and cleans out the soft decay and then fills the hole most often with an amalgam filling in a back tooth. <br /><br />First, the act of cutting the tooth weakens it further and the amalgam filling not only provides no support for the remaining tooth, but actually expands over time to create cracking of the tooth which will manifest possibly a couple of decades later.<br /><br />This was the most common problem I witnessed in my educated middle class patients. Few had active decay, but many (myself included!) kept on paying the price for dental treatment earlier in their life.<br /><br />When I trained as a dentist we were also taught 'extension for prevention' when cutting cavities. The most common form of decay is in the pits and fissures of the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. The concept being that if one part had decayed, the rest of the fissure was likely to decay not long afterwards. So running the fissure out and filling the entire fissure was regarded as a form of prevention.<br /><br />&quot;The best dental treatment is no dental treatment.&quot;<br /><br />Axiom<br /><br />Happily, advances in materials and thinking now mean that many dentists would now make the smallest cavity compatible with adequately cleaning out the decay and would then use a plastic filling material and seal the remaining fissure by bonding to prevent future decay.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the usual sequence in the life of each tooth goes something like this: small filling, larger filling, then either a crown or a cracked or decayed tooth requiring a root filling and crown. Then, maybe a decade or two later the root filling or tooth might fail requiring extraction and a bridge (involving cutting down adjacent teeth). This may lead to the supporting teeth ultimately dying and requiring root canals or extraction. The bridge itself might fail either requiring the placement of an implant or the necessity for a removable denture.<br /><br />Multiply this sorry tale by potentially 28 teeth and trauma from accidents, and you have a lifelong tale of woe and expense. And, it has to be said, a means of income generation for dentists around the globe. <br /><br />The only retort to this sequence is to intervene minimally at each stage and not to have elective 'cosmetic' treatment where possible. The only exception to this being the placing of overlays or onlays which are intended to protect the tooth and prevent it from future breakage.<br /><br />&quot;The only successful dental treatment is one where the patient dies before the restoration fails.&quot;<br /><br />Former Dental Professor<br /><br />So a biological dentist should consider the lifetime ramifications for the patient of every procedure and try to intervene minimally at each stage in order to prolong the useful life of each tooth.<br /><br />For more on this topic listen to Less is More Dentistry on the Mercury &amp; Dentistry page of the Audio hub.<br /><br />Dental amalgam<br />Dental amalgam is made of approximately 50% liquid mercury and 50% powdered alloy of silver, tin, copper and other metals. This material has been used for 180 years now and has never been subjected to any meaningful safety testing.<br /><br />Dental amalgam presents many problems which are explored in more detail elsewhere on this website and in my book Chronic Fatigue, ME and Fibromyalgia: The Natural Recovery Plan.<br /><br />The first of these problems is that the various metal components react in the moisture of the mouth to create a battery which causes the liquid mercury to vaporise. Much of this vapour is inhaled and passes into the blood from the lungs and from there to the rest of the body. Mercury also gets driven directly into the tissues of the mouth from the amalgam fillings, and the mercury vapour from the amalgam fillings can also pass directly into the brain through the roof of the nose. <br /><br />The problem being that mercury is an incredibly potent biological toxin which disrupts many enzyme systems throughout the body and is also possibly the most potent neurological toxin known causing the destruction of nerves and preventing their regeneration. <br /><br />The electromagnetic activity created by the presence of metals in the mouth including dental amalgam may directly interfere with the adjacent sensory organs such as the eye and the ear, the functioning of the brain and the master endocrine organs. <br /><br />In addition, the teeth all have acupuncture meridians running through them and the electrical activity on the meridians has been shown to detrimentally affect the associated organs systems. <br /><br />&quot;All restorative metals are alloys and generate an electric current. It's like having an idiot acupuncturist putting voltages on the meridians.&quot;<br /><br />Dr David Kennedy DDS<br /><br />The body is an electrical system as much as it is anything. We know that electrical potentials are maintained across cell membranes, that nerve conduction and muscular contraction are electrical phenomena and that the heart and brain emit significant electromagnetic fields which can be measured by electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) machines. Any electrical activity may influence any or all of these processes in ways that we currently don't fully understand. <br /><br />Each of the metal components of amalgam is also toxic in its own right and toxic metals are known to be massively synergistic once inside the body so that a combination of mercury, cadmium, copper and tin may have thousands of times the effect of any one of these metals alone. <br /><br />Metals may also act as dams on the acupuncture meridians, and many holistic practitioners are now coming round to the concept that metals have no place in dentistry. <br /><br />On a purely physical level, dental amalgam provides no additional strength to the remaining tooth - in fact it expands over time splitting or cracking the tooth. In contrast, composite resin fillings and ceramic restorations are bonded to the tooth providing additional strength.<br /><br />Last, but not least, amalgam fillings corrode and look ugly and many may choose alternatives on aesthetic grounds alone.<br /><br />For more information about this topic refer to Symptoms of Mercury Poisoning, A History of Mercury Poisoning, Is Dental Amalgam Safe for Humans?, book reviews of It's All in Your Head, and Whole Body Dentistry and the PDFs available in the Research hub.<br /><br />Removal of dental amalgam fillings<br />For some patients that decide to have their amalgam fillings replaced it is important not only to see a biological dentist who can protect them from further unnecessary mercury exposure during the procedure, but also to have been detoxifying mercury prior to the replacement of their fillings. <br /><br />This is because irrespective of how careful the dentist is, they will receive a large bolus dose of mercury when amalgam fillings are either placed or removed and if they are already very toxic, this can make some vulnerable people very sick indeed. <br /><br />The holistic dentist should:<br /><br />Ensure that their patients are consuming a healthy diet and either have prescribed, or have referred them to someone who has prescribed a supplement regime to be followed before, during and after all the relevant appointments.<br />Use powerful suction to extract the mercury contaminated air and any particles. Some biological dentists have a special unit with a large tube that sits on the patient's chest while the amalgam fillings are being removed which extracts and filters the air.<br />Check the fillings for electrical activity and remove them in sequence starting with those that are generating the greatest electrical currents first. Not all biological dentists agree on the necessity for this.  <br />Cover their patient in bibs and drapes so as not to contaminate their clothing with mercury vapour or amalgam particles.<br />Supply air, oxygen or nitrous oxide via a nasal mask while working or specifically while drilling their amalgam fillings.<br />Use copious water irrigation whilst removing the amalgam fillings.<br />Either use a nitrile or rubber dam to isolate the tooth/teeth and protect the patient from inhaling or swallowing particles and mercury and/or use a specially designed suction box.<br />Protect their staff who should wear special clothing and masks which filter mercury vapour. After amalgam removal, they should change gloves. <br />Administer intravenous (IV) vitamin C during the procedure which provides protection for the patient. Again, not all holistic dentists agree on the necessity for this.<br />Section the amalgam filling(s) into chunks rather than drill them out in order to minimise the amount of mercury vapour created.<br />Have a separator fitted to their waste water which collects the amalgam/mercury waste before it enters the sewerage system.<br />Have a central clean air system which is constantly filtering mercury vapour from the office air.<br />Use the most bio-compatible and technically appropriate materials for the replacement restorations.<br />Some biological dentists now favour using sedation and removing all amalgam fillings in one appointment even if the restorations placed are temporary. Permanent restorations can then be provided in the usual manner thereafter.<br /><br />For more information see the article Dental Amalgam Filling Replacement, the research PDF The Results of Removal of Dental Amalgam Fillings or the video Safer Amalgam Removal. <br /><br />Biocompatibility of dental materials<br />No dental material will ever be as good or as durable as the ones that nature created to do the job. Accepting this as a given, the next best material to a sound tooth is the one that does not cause an undue inflammatory, allergic or toxic reaction; that does not generate electrical activity and that does not block the energy meridian flows. It also needs to be aesthetic and durable.<br /><br />There are approximately 2,000 materials which can be used in dentistry and these should be tested ahead of time to assess their compatibility. This can be accomplished by means of a blood test which will list all the commonly used dental materials as either being suitable or incompatible for use on any given individual.<br /><br />This is particularly important, because once a material has been inserted into your body, the immune system is exposed to it 24/7. <br /><br />Muscle testing (kinesiology) is another way of assessing whether a material adversely affects the energy system of the body. If the patient remains strong when the material is introduced to their energy field then typically that material is acceptable, whereas if they become weak, then the material is a stressor to the body and should not be used.<br /><br />Composite is an aesthetic filling material made of glass beads embedded in a plastic resin that is typically set using a light. These fillings can be bonded to both the dentine and enamel of the tooth providing some reinforcement. This material is the most commonly used alternative to amalgam and can be repaired within reason as the dentist can bond more resin to the existing filling.<br /><br />Some dentists, such as Dr Hal Huggins, favour gold restorations on back teeth and they certainly are durable. However, gold is a metal and is always alloyed with other metals as it is too soft for use in its pure state. This brings several issues in its wake. <br /><br />The first is that all alloys are, by definition, galvanically active in the moisture of the mouth. Second, is that most metals used have some toxicity and gold has been linked in particular with the development of autoimmune disease(s). Another consideration is that any and all metals will block the meridian pathways. <br /><br />Gold is also more expensive because the restorations are made in a laboratory and at least two dental visits are required - one to prepare the tooth and take impressions and a second appointment to fit the restoration(s). <br /><br />It is for the reasons listed above that a growing number of holistic dentists are now metal-free. <br /><br />For more on this topic watch part 1 and part 2 of Clifford Dental Materials Testing or Testing Dental Materials for Biocompatibility. Also see Useful Contacts for laboratory resources and the research PDF Chronic Health Conditions Relating to Dental Health and Dental Procedures.<br /><br />Nickel<br />Most biological and holistic dentists will also try and avoid the use of nickel in any orthodontic appliances, cast crowns or bridges, removable appliances and stainless steel crowns (used on children). Whilst nickel is a strong, it is also highly toxic and can cause depression, suicidal thoughts and potentially cancer. <br /><br />For more information see the article Health Concerns About Nickel. <br /><br />Problems with root canal treatments<br />Root canal filled teeth are teeth that have died due to decay or a crack or fracture penetrating the pulp (nerve) chamber inside the tooth and that have had the root canal system cleaned out and obturated often using some sort of rubber-like material. <br /><br />There have been concerns about this procedure for nearly 200 years, some of which - it is feared - have been deliberately suppressed by various dental bodies. <br /><br />The problem is that whilst a root filling solves the problem of pain, it creates another issue whereby the tooth can act as a hatchery for various microorganisms within the tubular structure of the dentine and the canal system within the tooth. These bacteria and their toxins can then travel to other body parts acting as a 'focus of infection' whilst, because there is no circulation to the tooth, the immune system is incapable of controlling the microorganisms involved.  <br /><br />This can eventually lead to exhaustion of the immune system leading to chronic fatigue, autoimmune diseases and the ultimate immune deficiency disease: cancer. <br /><br />For more information see the article and associated videos Problems with Root Canal Fillings, the articles Book Review: The Roots of Disease, and the research PDF The Health Effects of Infections and Root Canal Filled Teeth or listen to the podcasts by Dr Stuart Nunnally, Dr Hal Huggins or Dr Robert Kulacz listed under Mercury &amp; Toxicity in the Audio hub. <br /><br />Jaw cavitations<br />Cavitations are areas within the jaw bone that have either failed to heal properly or are chronically infected. They are most often are associated with extraction sites but can also be caused by other interventions including root canal treatments.<br /><br />They can harbour noxious microorganisms which release potent toxins into the circulation so that they become foci of infection - infecting and toxifying the entire body.<br /><br />If you think your health may have been adversely affected following an extraction then consider attending a biological dentist who knows how to identify and treat dental cavitations.<br /><br />For more information either see the article and associated videos Dental Cavitations, the article Book Review: Beyond Amalgam, the research PDF Dental Cavitations and Health or listen to the podcasts by Dr Wes Shankland, Dr Stuart Nunnally or Dr Mark Breiner listed under Mercury &amp; Dentistry in the Audio Hub. <br /><br />Gum disease<br />Gum disease is probably the most common disease in the world and is certainly the biggest cause of tooth loss.<br /><br />In the early stages the gums may appear swollen and red and may bleed easily and this is known as gingivitis. This may progress on to affect the bony support for the teeth at which point the disease is known as periodontitis.<br /><br />The allopathic view is that bacteria adhere to the tooth causing inflammation and eventually penetrate and destroy the junction between the tooth and gum, and supporting bone. <br /><br />However, most holistic dentists take a wider view of the issue seeing it as being a systemic problem relating to nutritional deficiencies or unbalanced blood chemistries leading to pathology, inflammation and bone loss in a vulnerable area.<br /><br />Evidence for this view is that there is little sign of periodontal disease in people prior to the introduction of agriculture or in indigenous people in spite of the fact that oral hygiene was probably rudimentary at best. Also, a nutritional balancing programme can help to rectify gum disease. <br /><br />As stated above, any disease process involving the mouth may either cause systemic disease or may be caused by systemic disease via the meridian system, so that a localised pathology should be investigated with this in mind. <br /><br />The presence of toxic metals in restorative materials and mineral deficiencies are also other causes of gum and bone loss. <br /><br />For more information see the article What Causes Gum Disease?, listen to the podcasts Preventing Periodontal Disease and Calcium Therapy listed under Mercury &amp; Dentistry in the Audio Hub or watch Nutritional Approaches to Gum Disease. <br /><br />Home oral care<br />Most biological dentists will advise against the use of conventional toothpastes which usually contain foaming agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate and fluoride. Other toothpastes containing natural ingredients are available either through health food stores or online and some people use home remedies of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda or plain soap.<br /><br />A rotary electric or ultrasonic brush may aid oral hygiene and the use of a technique called tooth blotting utilises specially designed hollow fibre tooth brushes which absorb bacteria and dead cells and which are used with plain water. <br /><br />Much gum disease starts between the teeth as food and plaque deposits form and the conditions become anaerobic leading to the metamorphosis of microorganisms into their more potent and destructive forms. For this reason and to maintain fresh breath it is important to master the art of flossing and to do it at least once a day. <br /><br />Other agents such as colloidal silver, and hydrogen peroxide can be added to the reservoir of a water pik to irrigate the mouth, but alcohol based mouthwashes should be avoided as these contain cancer-causing alcohol along with other irritant chemicals. All fluoride containing products including mouthwashes should also be avoided (see below).<br /><br />For more information see the article What Causes Bad Breath? and the videos Tooth Blotting, Brushing Your Teeth Correctly and Toothbrushing the Gumline and Contact Areas. <br /><br />Water fluoridation<br />Fluoride has been added to the municipal water supplies in much of the US and some areas in the UK in order to supposedly prevent tooth decay. However, rates of tooth decay have declined in both fluoridated and unfluoridated areas in recent decades.  <br /><br />And fluoride is a potent toxin causing allergic reactions, increased hip fractures and osteoporosis, an increase in birth defects and cancerous tumours, learning disorders and lowered IQ and fluorosis (mottling or banding of the teeth).<br /><br />Fluoride also displaces iodine in the thyroid gland causing thyroid disease and particularly accumulates in the pineal gland. Fluoridation of the water also causes more lead and aluminium to leach into the water from pipes. <br /><br />For more information see the article The Health Risks of Fluoride or watch the video The Fluoride Ultimatum.<br /><br />Dental implants<br />Some biological dentists place dental implants and some feel that any foreign body embedded in bone through the gums poses a risk both from the ability of microorganisms to enter the inner sanctum of the body around the implant and also to create a foreign body reaction over time.<br /><br />The majority of implants placed are metal and most often are made of titanium which may also contain or be combined with other metals used for the restoration. These metals may create galvanic reactions and may also block the meridians.<br /><br />Newer, non-metallic, zirconium implants are now becoming available, and these have limitations because they are a fixed piece rather than having the option to correct for the various angles between the bone available and the angulation of the tooth.<br /><br />All the instruments used during surgery are also made out of zirconium oxide, so that there is no contact with metal, no matter how temporary.<br /><br />Early reports are that these systems rapidly osseo-integrate due to the rough surface finish and that the gums also appear to accept or tolerate these implants well. Both implant and restoration are made of the same material: zirconium although the crown has porcelains baked on to produce an aesthetic result. <br /><br />For more information see Dental Implants: Pros and Cons.<br /><br />X-ray radiation<br />X-rays do need to be taken in order to assess previous treatments eg: root fillings, the presence or otherwise of cavitations which may be visible, and to monitor both periodontal disease and the presence of tooth decay either between teeth or under existing restorations.<br /><br />However, the minimum number of x-rays compatible with good practice should be taken and low dosage equipment used. Need should be assessed on an individual basis so that some people who maintain their mouths well may only need a couple of small x-rays every few years and others with active disease may need to have x-rays taken more frequently. <br /><br />For more information see the article Ionising Radiation Hazard. <br /><br />Temperomandibular joint dysfunction and bite problems<br />The temperomandibular or jaw joint (TMJ) is very important in physiological terms. First, it is the only joint in the body where two joints articulate in this way with another bone - the base of the skull. And a large proportion of the motor and sensory cortex of the brain is also devoted to the temperomandibular joint for reasons that aren't fully understood. <br /><br />The TMJ and pelvis also compensate for one another so that dysfunction in one girdle can cause problems remotely with the other.<br /><br />It may also not be possible for the jaws to adopt their optimal position because of the occlusion of the teeth. If one or more teeth touch fractionally sooner than the remainder of the teeth this can place the teeth and supporting tissues under a great deal of stress and also cause dysfunction in the jaw joint as the closing position of the jaw is redirected by the teeth. <br /><br />Problems with the bite or occlusion can cause seemingly unconnected problems elsewhere in the body such that adjustment of the bite can rectify problems with the back or knees, for example. <br /><br />For more information watch the video The Dental/Whole Body Connection.<br /><br />Orthodontic treatment<br />The standard orthodontic treatment for crowding is the extraction of 2 or 4 premolar (bicuspid) teeth in order to make room to retract the remaining teeth. <br /><br />This treatment is necessary because our jaws have shrunk so dramatically due to our modern diet. And this approach makes the problem worse by arranging the teeth in both jaws around the jaw that has shrunk most. This has implications for the entire musculoskeletal system of the body. <br /><br />Holistic dentists are keen on functional orthodontic appliances which are used to expand the jaws to accommodate the teeth without extractions. <br /><br />For more information watch The Dental/Whole Body Connection.  <br /><br />Other considerations in holistic dentistry<br />Most biological or holistic dentists will try and avoid the use of antibiotics and pain killers using digestive enzymes and homeopathic remedies where possible. <br /><br />Some will also offer conscious sedation (nitrous oxide or 'laughing gas'), intravenous sedation, intravenous vitamin C, hyperbaric oxygen, and prescribe various homeopathic, vibrational and other supplements as an adjunct to treatment. Some may take blood samples for analysis or refer their patients to other practitioners who are knowledgable in this area.<br /><br />For more on this topic listen to Dr Lina Garcia listed under Mercury &amp; Toxicity in the Audio Hub. <br />Dentistry is technically very demanding and when you add to that an understanding of the implications of treatment and finding a dentist that you find empathetic and affordable, then it can become quite difficult finding a shoe that fits.
