<br /><br />You have charming eyes....they are a forest of autumn leaves reflecting the shining of the sun that start to emerge at the moment you open the doors of this heaven(your eyes) and leave them to lit the world with a symphony of beauty and sweet life, as sweet as you are. 
<br /><br />I have Just written these humble words while I was looking at your eyes.
<br /><br />thanks... to the one who wrote this!

<br />Some suicidal teen
<br />Who makes choice to kill herself
<br />When the world just seems too mean.
<br />She cant go on with life
<br />Or so to her it seems
<br />Reality has fallen short
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />Some pregnant little girl
<br />Who met this great guy
<br />And then gave sex a whirl
<br />She was only 15
<br />But it felt so right
<br />She thought theyd be together
<br />For more than just a night
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />Some kid strung out on crack
<br />Who started at a party
<br />and now she cant turn back
<br />First cigarettes and alcohal
<br />Now meth crack and cocaine
<br />Shes been smoking it so long
<br />That now she's gone insane
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />Some girl left in the rain
<br />WHo was walking home from school
<br />Then raped and left in pain
<br />She cant tell her parents
<br />And it hurts to tell her friends
<br />She doenst know what she'll do
<br />To make this nightmare end
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />Some kid out of school
<br />Who dropped out early
<br />And was acting like a fool
<br />He thought that it was boring
<br />He thought that it was dumb
<br />He doesnt have an education
<br />But lives on the streets like a bum
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />Some stereotypical teen
<br />Im gunna make a difference
<br />Ill finish with my dream
<br />I wont end up pregnant
<br />On drugs or even dead 
<br />I wont drop out of school
<br />Because ill use my head
<br /><br />I dont want to be another statistic
<br />To fit into some mold
<br />Of what society thinks of kids today
<br />Because its getting kind of old
<br />Not all of us are bad
<br />In fact most of us are good
<br />When will the world see us
<br />And give us credit like they should?

I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an eight-year-old again! I want to go down to McDonalds and think it’s a five-star restaurant. I want to think that M and M's are better than money because you can eat them. I want to eat a whole packet of Tim tams without feeling guilty afterwards. I want to return to when all you knew were colors, multiplication, tables and nursery rhymes. I want to return to when you didn't know and you didn't care. I want to remember the whole morning was filled of what your Mom had packed for lunch and the whole afternoon what you were having for dinner. When a simple matchbox car or a Barbie doll represented a whole week's worth of entertainment. When you actually had an imagination. When magic really existed. When 'Jaws' didn't look fake. I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and good would always triumph over evil. When a member of the of the opposite sex was just some annoying disturbance. When friends were real and you didn't care if they were black, white, Catholic, Asian, African, Muslim, fat, skinny, pink, green or from a whole other planet, it just didn't matter... until others told you differently! I want to believe that anything is possible all you have to do is Dream. I want it to be unknown to me the complexities of life and to be completely ecstatic by the little things again like the sound of the Mr. Whippy Van! I DON'T want to know of school, homework, clothes, friendship, relationships,popularity or even gossip! I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams and human kind. I want to believe that all adults must know everything (How wrong we were). So here's my money, keycards, my makeup, and my adolescence.

<br /><br />We spend more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses, but smaller families. We have more compromises, but less time. We have more knowledge, but less judgement. We have more medicines, but less health.
<br /><br />We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk much, we love only a little, and we hate too much.
<br /><br />We reached the moon and came back, but we find it troublesome to cross our own street and meet our neighbors. We have conquered the outer space, but not our inner space.
<br /><br />We have higher income, but less morals… These are times with more liberty, but less joy… With much more food, but less nutrition…
<br /><br />These are days in which two salaries come home, but divorces increase. These are times of finer houses, but more broken homes. 
<br /><br />That’s why I propose that as of today -- You do not keep anything for a special occasion, because every day that you live is a special occasion. Search for knowledge, read more, sit on your front porch and admire the view without paying attention to the needs. Pass more time with your family, eat your favorite food, visit the place you love. Life is a chain of moments of enjoyment; it isn’t only survival.
<br /><br />Use your crystal goblets. Do not save your best perfume… use it every time you feel you want it. Take out from your vocabulary phrases like, “one of these days” and “someday”. Let’s write that letter we thought of writing “one of these days…”
<br /><br />Let’s tell our families and friends how much we love them. Never pass up a chance at adding laughter and joy to your life. Every day, hour, and minute are special… Because you never know if it will be your last…
<br /><br />If you’re too busy to take some minutes to share this message with someone you love, and you tell yourself that you will share it “one of these days”… “one of these days” can be very far away, and you may not be there to see it…
