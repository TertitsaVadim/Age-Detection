What is actually costly is spending the money to fix your teeth after things have gone wrong. Those that take the time to care for their mouth and teeth are the ones that will spend very little money for oral hygiene. To make sure that your gums and teeth are healthy, use the following tactics everyday on your teeth to keep them well.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.static.flickr.com%2F8172%2F8049917896_8438d4ab9f.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8172/8049917896_8438d4ab9f.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;236&quot; style=&quot;padding:10px;&quot;/&gt;<br /><br />Although having bad breath is very common, it is sometimes debilitating socially, and cannot be stopped unless the halitosis is brought under control. Individuals that have had bad breath only recently may want to go to the doctor to find out if there are health related reasons for its sudden appearance. The situation could be dangerous, and not something as uncomplicated and embarrassing as bad breath. If you have not been to the dentist for a while, schedule a checkup to see if you are having any problems in your mouth. In some cases, you may also have to see your general practitioner, as stomach issues can also cause bad breath. To make sure that no one can smell your bad breath, and you are sure that it is not a medical issue, only use unsweetened or sugar-free mouthwash and mints to protect yourself from future cavities. <br /><br />To keep your teeth healthy, always brush them on a regular basis. To be healthy, and on the safe side, brush your teeth a couple times a day. On the other hand, it's not a good idea to brush your teeth more than three times per day, as this can damage the enamel that covers your teeth.<br /><br />It is easy to imagine people that would not want to brush, but there are actually people that must brush after every meal that they have which can be time-consuming and unnecessary. To conform with proper hygiene, you need to replace your toothbrush every 30 to 60 days. Brushing your teeth will help prevent cavities, and brushing your tongue may actually help your bad breath. Your breath will be a literal &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; if you use a bacteria scraper on your tongue regularly.<br /><br />The difficulty with most people and dental hygiene is that they wait till the last minute before they do anything that is beneficial for their mouth, teeth, or gums. Sadly, when people reach this point, it is going to cost them a lot of money to fix their problem, a dilemma that may not have occurred through preventative means. It is important that people go to the dentist regularly so that small problems can be fixed early and not become major ordeals. Having trust in your dentist is very important in regard to your motivation to return. If you do have cavities, and your dentist wants to fix them (for a small fortune!), it is important to get a second opinion to make sure you are going to pay the correct amount for the procedures. <br /><br />You need to be able to floss your teeth, and brush them, at least twice a day; doing this will allow you to maintain healthy sturdy teeth. Instead of paying the dentist, why don't you do a little preventative work on your teeth each day to make sure that they are healthy and cavity free. The tips we've discussed in this article are a good starting point if you want to have healthy teeth that you can keep for your entire life.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy81ODg2MTktSG93LVRvLUdldC1XaGl0ZXItVGVldGgtTmF0dXJhbGx5Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Using Organic Teeth Whitening At Home</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL0NyYWlnSUNvbnJhZDEyL2Jsb2cvMTA3NzY0Nw__" target="_blank">Teeth Whitening (No Surgery Or Expense)</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NyYWlnaWNvbnJhZDEyLnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vZW50cnkvMjAxMi0xMC0wM1QxMF80Nl8zMy0wN18wMA__" target="_blank">Natural Teeth Whitening - Safe Products That Whiten Teeth</a>
