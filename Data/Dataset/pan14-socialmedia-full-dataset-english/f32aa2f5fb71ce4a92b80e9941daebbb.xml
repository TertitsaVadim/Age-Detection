<br /><br />Properties :
<br /><br />QUALITY : Water based colours for glass, declined in gloss, frosted or shimmer, remarkably transparent and bright. Excellent lightfastness.
<br />COLOUR MIXABILITY : Colours can be mixed together
<br />DRYING : tack-free in a few minutes, fully dry in minimum 24 hours. 40 minutes at 160°C (325°F) (steady temperature) in a domestic oven, after minimum 24 hours drying.
<br />SURFACES : glass, crystal ...
<br />THINNER : Vitrea 160 thinner
<br />OPACITY : Transparent colours
<br />FINISH : Brilliant, frosted or shimmer
<br />CARING (decorated surfaces) : after baking, remarkable resistance to use in dishwashers and to normal solvents and detergents
<br />BRUSHES : Pébéo Cobra deco or Iris brushes
<br />BRUSH CLEANING : Soapy water
<br />NUMBER OF COLOURS : 20 brilliant colours, 10 frosted colours, 5 shimmer colours
<br />PACKAGING : 45ml bottle - all colours. Glossy markers - 9 colours. Frosted markers - 9 colours. Outliners - 10 colours
<br />STANDARDS : conforms to toy safety standard 71.3
<br /><br />Product Usage :
<br /><br />30 remarkably transparent colours and 5 brand new shimmer shades for magnificient decorations on glass. Available in glossy or frosted, the Vitrea 160 colours combine professional quality and ease of use. After baking at 160&amp;deg;C (325&amp;deg;F) in a domestic oven, the depth of the colour is enhanced and the paints are dishwasher safe. Applied on glass and crystal, the transparency of Vitrea 160 colours allows you to take full advantage of the light. However, Vitrea 160 can be applied on other thermostable surfaces which can withstand a temperature of 160&amp;deg;C (325&amp;deg;F).
<br /><br />Vitrea 160 are ready to use colours. Available in liquid, paste or felt tip markers, the Vitrea 160 colours display the same characteristics and properties. Either used alone or together, you are completely free to experiment with the effects and techniques of the paints. The glossy or frosted appearance of the colours provides an infinite variety of light and shadow effects. After baking, colours are exceptionally intense and glass seems to be bodydyed. To thin colours, use the Vitrea 160 thinner. Gloss and frosted medium are used to lighten the colours without changing their technical characteristics ; iridescent medium, when mixed with colours, produces iridescent colours. To obtain a crackle finish, first apply the crackling medium step 1, followed by the step 2 and then paint over with colour.
<br /><br />Before painting with Vitrea 160, simply degrease with alcohol or soapy water. Allow to air dry for 24 hours, then bake in an ordinary domestic oven. Place the decorated object in a cold oven. Once the temperature has reached 160&amp;deg;C (325&amp;deg;F), allow to bake for 40 minutes. After baking, colours are dishwasher safe and resistant to detergents and common solvents. Only the areas not intended to be put in contact with food must be decorated.
<br />Store markers flatwise.
