<br /><br />Human growth hormone is a hormone synthesized by the pituitary gland. But, unfortunately, with age, the ability of the pituitary gland to produce human growth hormones gradually declines. This increasing decline begins after the age of 30 when the human growth hormone levels reach 20% of the peak levels in childhood. The decrease varies in between 12 and 15 percent per 10 years. You should not see this decline as being purely a manifestation of aging. Even if your human growth hormone levels would remain the same as those at the age of a 25 year old adult for prolonged periods of time the signs of aging would still be noticeable. The difference is that the effects would be seen at a very old age. Also, you should understand that human growth hormones do not affect the lifespan of a person, but inhibit the manifestations of aging. 
<br /><br />You can stimulate the body to increase the production of human growth hormones. Take note that this approach is recommended only after 30 years of age. This can be accomplished by using natural human growth hormone releasers such as: arginine, glutamine, gaba, l-lysine, l-glycine and l-tyrosine.
<br /><br />Arginine is an essential amino acid and one of the most efficient natural human growth hormone releasers. The fact that it is an essential amino acid means that it is not synthesized by the body and that it is obtained from food items or by supplementation. Arginine is quite efficient in stimulating the pituitary gland. In fact, research has shown that 15 to 30 g of arginine administered intravenously will stimulate the production of human growth hormones. Other beneficial effects of arginine include: improving the health of the thymus gland, of the liver, of the immunity system, the increases of muscle tissue production and of the body's skin regenerative capabilities. It also has detoxifying capabilities and it gives great results with cancer treatment.
<br /><br />The second on our list is l-lysine, which stimulates the body to increase the production of antibodies, enzymes and hormones. It also improves calcium assimilation, increases collagen production and increases nitrogen synthesis.
<br /><br />The third of the natural human growth hormone releasers list is glutamine. Glutamine is an amino acid that has the property of naturally stimulating the production of human growth hormones. It is used in the body to counterattack the harmful damages of high stress periods. It is the primary amino acid needed for the proper functioning of the immune system and gut. Also, recent research shows that glutamine has an essential role in the proper metabolic function, in DNA synthesis, cell division and growth and muscle maintenance.
<br /><br />The fourth on our natural human growth hormone releasers list is l-glycine. L-glycine is known to aid in increasing muscle building results, to act as one of the stimulants of the pituitary gland, to decrease hyperactive brain activity which is responsible for producing spasms
<br /><br />The next on our list is l-tyrosine, an amino acid which is precursor to the three essential neurotransmitters of the body, responsible for normal mental function and mood.
<br /><br />The sixth and last on our natural human growth hormone releasers is gaba. Gaba or gamma-aminobutyric acid is a supplement which has the property of decreasing body fat levels, stimulating the production of lean muscle mass as it stimulates the production of human growth hormones.

This common problem actually comes in two forms, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, both of which can be very bothersome especially for someone who has been suffering from it for a very long time.

First of all, it's not really an illness but an offshoot of the wearing away of the cartilage at the joints, causing pain as the bones rub against each other. And although old people are more likely to develop arthritis, it can also happen to younger people, especially those who are obese.<br /><br />It's quite surprising for people to realize that in this modern age, no cure for arthritis has yet been developed. However, several remedies are currently available that can be used to enjoy arthritis relief, either temporarily or for a longer period. Of these remedies, the natural methods are those that give the best results and last the longest.<br /><br />Health experts are in agreement that the best way to enjoy arthritis relief is to use natural methods. One of the most recommended of such methods is to lose weight. Statistics show that majority of arthritis sufferers are overweight or even obese. The excess weight that they are carrying around is too heavy for their bones, leading to joint injuries and arthritic pain. Hence, the best solution for these cases is to simply get rid of the excess weight in order to relieve some of the pressure that is causing the joints to suffer.<br /><br />Another highly recommended natural method for getting arthritis relief is regular exercise. While in the throes of arthritis, exercising would probably be the last thing that you want to do. But once the pain has died down, you will find that regular light exercise can help you considerably in managing your condition. Aerobic exercises and strengthening routines like swimming, biking or walking should be on the top of your list, instead of high-impact exercises that can cause more damage to your bones. <br /><br />If you are willing to try alternative methods of treatment in order to enjoy arthritis relief, you may want to consider acupuncture. This procedure has been used for millions of years in ancient Chinese medicine and is only now gaining popularity in the western world. Acupuncture is a purely natural method and it does not cause any negative side effects, although some people may be too queasy to give it a try.<br /><br />There are some natural medications that are currently being used today that are supposedly excellent tools for getting arthritis relief, like glucosamine and chondroitin. However, there is still a lot of controversy regarding the effectiveness of these drugs and even the research is not yet that convincing. <br /><br />No matter how many arthritis remedies are invented, the fact remains that prevention is still the best solution to arthritis. By eating a balanced, healthy diet and exercising regularly, you can make your body strong and keep yourself safe from the pain of arthritis and many other medical conditions associated with old age.

This is because attempting new things will force the brain to perform at its best even at things, which may not be its forte.

Spending time by engaging in a conversation or joining a club or volunteering helps to improve relationship and also help to meet new individuals. People can also get a new cat or dog and gain positive experience as they are very social animals and are a great medium to meet new people as well.

Laughter stimulates a large part of the brain and causes the production of beneficial chemicals. <br /><br />Additionally, people must also try and eliminate stress completely from their life due to the negative impact it leaves behind. Stress does a lot of damage to the brain and is bad for the memory. Keeping stress under control definitely helps to provide a powerful and alert mind. People must always try to be attentive and concentrated. This helps to reduce grey matter which provides a protective effect against nerve cell death. It also promotes neurogenesis, which is the production of new nerve cells that helps to improve learning and memory.<br /><br />Stress is one of the worst enemies of the brain.

Meditation is the best way to control stress. It improves focus, concentration, creativity, learning and reasoning skills. It increases the activity in the left prefrontal cortex, along with thickening the cerebral cortex and encouraging more connections between brain cells. <br /><br />Also, the intake of nutrition can make changes that will promote a healthy mind and memory. A healthy diet, with lots of vitamins, proteins and fiber will increase blood circulation in the body, enhancing more efficient brain functioning. Avoiding fatty foods and carbohydrates have shown to be beneficial to brain health and also to prevent other disorders. Finally, the above techniques will surely improve memory and also harness the complete power of the brain. It helps people to become effective at solving a variety of problems and also have a positive outlook in life.  Caution: This is in no way a substitute for doctor's advice.

In certain cases the person might even become impulsive or restless.
<br /><br />As said before ADHD is the acronym for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder which is, as the name says an attention health problem. The health problem is also referred under the following names: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, attention deficit hyperactive or kinetic disorder. The preference for a certain term depends on medic and country.
<br /><br />ADHD has the highest impact on children as they are affected in higher percentages than adults and the presence of the disorder is harder to notice, especially since most children tend to be energetic and restless when young.
<br /><br />There are three types of ADHD, each with its own set of particular symptoms: Predominantly inactive type is characterized by low organization capabilities and the incapability to finish a task. People might find it hard to follow instructions and especially small details and may have problems following a conversation. Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type has the tendency to be hyperactive physically and verbally. Children are impulsive and most of the times restless. They have problems waiting or following directions. Combined type includes symptoms from the first two types of ADHD.
<br /><br />ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is an attention health problem which is frequent in children, but is also present in a significant percentage of adults. It is characterized by the symptoms: chattering, inattentiveness, restlessness, fidgeting, overactive tendencies and low concentration abilities.
<br /><br />ADHD is a biological condition which is caused by a chemical unbalance present at the brain level. Unfortunately the causes for ADHD are not clearly known, despite the fact that research has been undergone regarding this aspect. What is known is that there are certain factors that stimulate to some extent ADHD: genetic predisposition (higher risk if a person that is close suffers from this affection), gender (boys have a higher predisposition than girls), alimentation (some additives present in the food might stimulate it).
<br /><br />How to act if you suspect that you or a person that is close to you might be affected by it? ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a biological condition which results in decreased concentration capabilities. If you suspect you have it, you should contact a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment.

Yes, you have read correctly, the causes of acne. Unfortunately acne is not caused by a single factor, but by numerous factors that affect the health of your skin and cause what is known as acne. Acne is caused by blocked hair follicles. Hair follicles usually become blocked by the excess sebum (oil) secreted by the glands which accumulates dead skin cells and bacteria. Normally the sebum secreted by the glands acts as a skin moisturizer. But because of different internal unbalances, the glands begin to produce more sebum than is required. The sebum with the dead skin cells act like a natural plug for the hair follicle, thus favoring the bacteria accumulated in the hair follicle to develop and multiply. The results are the well known white heads and black heads. And if the follicle becomes inflamed the person also develops what is known as pimples. Looking for a quick option to get rid of acne? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RvZXNjbGVhcnBvcmVzd29yay53ZWVibHkuY29t" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a>.
<br /><br />There are numerous causes of acne, but the most common ones include: hormones, medication, diet, stress or improper cosmetics.
<br /><br />Hormones are in fact the most common causes of acne. In fact, acne is considered as being a hormonal health problem. Hormones have the function of maturation of the oil glands in the skin and for this reason acne is not present in small children. Acne appears as a result of a hormonal unbalance, hormonal unbalances that might be triggered by: puberty, pregnancy, menopause and general health problems. And from all hormones, the ones that affect acne the most are the androgens hormones. So, a common treatment for acne in females is medically prescribed contraceptive medicated treatment.

And how can it not be so when the weight loss diets market in the US alone have had a revenue of $42 billion from weight loss foods, products and services. As you can see, it is quite simple to understand why the companies are creating more and more low efficient diets which require prolonged use and assistance.

<br /><br />Daily diet plan modification should focus on a healthier nutritional plan. This means that it should lower the consumption of fat and increase the consumption of: lean meat like fish or poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, nuts, whole grain bakery products, low fat dairy products. Plus, your daily diet plan should focus on an overall lowering of the caloric intake in the healthy margins. The diet should also advise you on how to combine food items to obtain all the nutrients needed by the body in a certain caloric range and not give an exact caloric intake of certain food items a day. By doing so you will be able to gradually change your dietary lifestyle for the better on the long term.
<br /><br />Physical activity behavioral changes imply that you will learn how to gradually and efficiently integrate physical activity in your daily routine. The efficient weight loss diets will come with a long term training program with at least 3 training levels: beginner, intermediate and advanced. These levels will differ not only by the exercises that you do, but also on the intensity level to gradually and efficiently improve your body's resistance and train your muscle mass.
<br /><br />Medical interventions are an addition that is not actually a diet, but which require additional behavioral modifications which most of the time efficient weight loss diets for the patient to regain a healthier lifestyle. They are required in extreme obesity cases.
<br /><br />Second, you should determine whether or not the diet that you want to follow is a “fad” diet plan or in other words a diet plan that will offer you results only while you are following it. Here are a couple of hints which will help you to spot “fad” weight loss diets: - it promises fast weight loss with results which seem too good to be true; - they have lists of food items that you should eat and which you should not eat; - your caloric intake has been drastically limited (usually to around 1000 calories a day); - they require the use of certain vitamin/mineral supplement or brand of food products; - it requires the elimination of entire food groups (like meat, dairy, nuts, grains or even fruit or vegetables); - long term of the diet is not advised and might even cause you health problems; - no physical activity is required; - it is written by a so called expert in weight management;

The reason being to look good, of course, but it also increases the level of resistance in the  body. Thereby, increasing the level of self-confidence. Although, it may sound easy if you are looking forward to build  muscles, but trust me –it does take a lot of effort coupled with high levels of commitment and dedication. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5maXRuZXNzcmV2aWV3Y2VudHJhbC5jb20vb3B0aW11bS1hbmFib2xpY3MtcmV2aWV3" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a faster solution to boost muscle growth.<br /><br />Well, the basic rule  for getting mass muscles is to eat right. Eating right is actually a key to success! You need to ensure that your diet  plan contains foods that are highly rich on protein as it helps you to pump the muscles. Proteins can take two forms,  just in case you did not know. They are: complete proteins and incomplete proteins! Well, the complete protein foods can  be found out in most of the dairy products as well as some of the meat items; whereas incomplete proteins comes from  vegetables.<br /><br />Much of the work that  has to be put in, in order to build mass muscles is to carry out your workouts. Since this is as important as eating  right, you need to ensure that you have a proper workout plan and routines as well. Try to start with lower weights and  move on to the next level; in addition try and get the aid of a spotter if you need to. And one final advice on this  point is to lower the number of reps if you feel too tired, especially if you are carrying bulkier weights as this may  carry the risk of tearing off your muscles.<br /><br />It is equally important to get appropriate rest, whilst the  above two is carried out as well. The reason being that this helps in allowing some time for the muscles to grow up. Do  not work-out like crazy and damage your muscles without getting proper rest. One effective method is to target different  parts of your body whilst carrying out your workout routines. For instance: you can target your shoulders on day 1,  whilst targeting your chest areas on day 2. In that way, the muscles for your shoulders do get a rest!<br /><br />Finally, let me highlight you one important point that I notice nowadays. In order to boost up the muscle growth, people  generally consume supplements – but the downside is that it does contain side effects and can be hazardous to one’s life.  So my advice is that – you work hard the proper way and there is no stopping for you in terms of getting the desired  shape of your life.

It appears on the skin as; congested pores or comedones; tender red bumps called pimples, pustules and cysts. The condition, however, happens when the sebaceous glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated to elevate the levels of male hormones at the time of puberty. During this period, the sebum production by the sebaceous glands accelerates, causing the oil to clog the follicular opening or pores. The pores enlarge, allowing irritants and bacteria to access the skin, ultimately producing inflammation. There are also some other factors which worsen the condition, including; heredity, food, dirt, stress, certain drugs and cosmetics. Need fast relief? <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGVhcnNraW5tYXhkZXRhaWxzLmNvbS9jbGVhci1za2luLW1heC1zaWRlLWVmZmVjdHMv" target="_blank">Check out this article</a> on Clear Skin Max.<br /><br />People can treat acne easily by natural treatments. It is the purest way to eliminate acne from the body. Some common acne treatments are; aloe Vera, sarsaparilla root, licorice root, tea tree oil, dandelion, Echinacea, burdock root, honey, egg whites, tomatoes, AHA and lime juice. Using honey is proven to be effective to ease the removal of acne. It removes the black heads, preventing further acne outbreak. Egg whites dry off the pimples and remove them, while tomatoes effectively remove white and black heads. AHA stands for Alpha Hydroxyl Fruit acid, and is usually found in creams. The acid helps to remove the dead skin cells. Lime juice not only helps to remove pimples, but also to get rid of discoloring spots on the face.<br /><br />All acne remedies work to reduce acne by; decreasing sebum secretion, accelerating skin cell division, fighting the infection and reducing the inflammation. The different types of treatments include; topical treatments, antibiotics, isotretinoin, laser treatment, natural medication and surgical procedures. Topical treatments vary from lotions, creams and drugs. They are generally mild and contain active ingredients like benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, salicylic acid and resorcinol. Some of the topical medications may contain stronger ingredients like Tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, others), adapalene (Differin) and tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage). However, these medications have a few side effects like skin irritation, dryness, flaking, stinging and redness.<br /><br />Antibiotics are used for moderate and severe forms of acne, and are only taken for short period of time. This is because the bacteria can become resistant to the drug. Antibiotics may cause side effects, such as upset stomach, dizziness and skin discoloration. Another effective treatment to relieve acne symptoms is isotretinoin. It is a powerful medication, which helps to treat scarring cystic acne and severe forms of acne. However, this also has side effects like dry eyes, itching, nose bleeds, muscle aches, poor vision and sun sensitivity. Laser therapy is also used to treat acne. It kills the bacteria that causes inflammation and decreases the oil production. Laser therapy also improves the skin texture and lessens the appearance of scars.<br /><br />People can also alleviate acne by therapies like dermabrasion, laser treatment and photo therapy. Dermabrasion is where the surface of the skin is removed by abrasion, to remove and lessen the acne scars and lesions left behind. The procedure, however, is painful and requires general anesthesia. Laser treatment is used to reduce the scars left behind by acne and prevents acne formation. Photo therapy is where visible light is used to treat mild and moderate acne, and the free radicals released kills the bacteria, preventing acne.<br /><br />To conclude, for people with cystic acne, the boils can be drained though surgical lancing. This procedure helps to get rid of acne permanently.

Like many other health problems, ADHD is probably caused by a series of combinations of different factors which, in different percentages, may cause the health problem. The factors which are currently suspected to have a high incidence on the development of ADHD are: genetics, environmental factors, brain injuries and nutrition. 
<br /><br />Genetics is the most probable of the possible causes of ADHD. The studies conducted on the issue have shown that ADHD is hereditary. This means that if a person is suffering from ADHD, then his close blood related relatives have a higher predisposition towards the disease. Currently research is being conducted to discover the genes which are responsible for this health problem. By knowing the genes which cause ADHD, doctors will be able to treat the problem before the symptoms appear.
<br /><br />Environmental factors are also one of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Blcmtzb2ZhaGVhbHRoaWVybGlmZXN0eWxlLm9uc3VnYXIuY29tL1VuZGVyc3RhbmQtV2hhdC1DYXVzZXMtQURIRC1NYXktVmVyeS1XZWxsLTIzNTI3MTQ4" target="_blank">possible causes of ADHD</a>. Research has shown that if a woman drinks alcohol and smokes during pregnancy, then she subjects her child to a higher risk of developing ADHD later in life. Also, children that have been exposed to environments rich in lead during the first years in their life have a higher predisposition towards the health problem. Common unknown lead rich environments are plumbing fixtures and old paint. Learn more about children and adhd at: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy53aGF0aXNhZGhkMTAxLmNvbS9hZGhkLWluLWNoaWxkcmVuLw__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatisadhd101.com%2Fadhd-in-children%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatisadhd101.com/adhd-in-children/</a></a>
<br /><br />Brain injuries are another of the possible causes of ADHD. In many cases those who have suffered from brain injury have experienced symptoms which are highly similar to those of the ADHD patients. It should also be noted that children who have suffered brain injury might have a predisposition to developing ADHD.
<br /><br />Nutrition is also a probable cause of ADHD. The most relevant possible nutritional factors are sugar and food additives.
<br /><br />Sugar and especially refined sugar is considered to stimulate, to some extent, the ADHD symptoms. Results regarding this issue are not yet conclusive, but they do not eliminate the possibility of them having an impact on the health problem. In a study a group of children were given the recommended amount of sugar/substitutes, while the others were given a surplus amount of sugar/substitutes. The children that were given higher doses suffered a decrease in their concentration abilities in comparison with those that have taken the recommended dosages. There has been no significant difference observed between the sugar and sugar substitute participants. In another study children were given either sugar or aspartame, a sugar substitute. For certain children mothers were told the opposite of the type of sugar that their children were given. The mothers who thought that their children were given sugar, when in fact they were given aspartame, became more critical of their child’s behavior, while the mothers of the children that were given aspartame which in fact was sugar became less critical of their behavior.
<br /><br />Recent research has shown that food additives might in fact have an impact on ADHD and that the most susceptible are artificial preservatives and colors. In present, research is being conducted regarding this matter.
