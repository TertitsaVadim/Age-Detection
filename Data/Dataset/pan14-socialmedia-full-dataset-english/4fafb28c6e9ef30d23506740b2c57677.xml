<br /><br />I received this from a friend who had a choice to make. It said that I had a choice to make too.
<br /><br />I've chosen. Now it's your turn to choose.
<br /><br />The story goes that some time ago a mother punished her five year old daughter for wasting a roll of expensive gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and she became even more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
<br /><br />Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift box to her mother the next morning and then said, 'This is for you, Mummy.'
<br /><br />The mother was embarrassed by her earlier over reaction, but her anger flared again when she opened the box and found it was empty. She spoke to her daughter in a harsh manner. 'Don't you know, young lady, when you give someone a present there's
<br />supposed to be something inside the package?'
<br /><br />She had tears in her eyes and said, 'Oh, Mummy, it's not empty! I blew kisses into it until it was full.'
<br /><br />The mother was crushed. She fell on her knees and put her arms around her little girl, and she begged her forgiveness for her thoughtless anger.
<br /><br />An accident took the life of the child only a short time later, and it is told that the mother kept that gold box by her bed for all the years of her life. Whenever she was discouraged or faced difficult problems she would open the box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.
<br /><br />In a very real sense, each of us, as human beings, have been given a Golden box filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children, family, friends. There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.
<br /><br />You now have two choices:
<br /><br />1. Pass this on to your friends, or
<br /><br />2. Delete it and act like it didn't touch your heart.
<br /><br />As you can see, I took choice No. 1.
<br /><br />Friends are like angels who lift us to our feet, when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.
<br /><br />If you receive this more than once in return just know that your friends have also thought of you

<br /><br />Marriage changes passion.
<br />Suddenly you're in bed with a relative.
<br /><br />I saw a woman wearing a sweat shirt with &quot;Guess&quot; on it.
<br />So I said &quot;Implants?&quot; She hit me.
<br /><br />How come we choose from just two people to run for president and over fifty for Miss America ?
<br /><br />I signed up for an exercise class and was told to wear loose-fitting clothing. If I HAD any loose-fitting clothing, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place!
<br /><br />When I was young we used to go &quot;skinny dipping,&quot; now I just &quot;chunky dunk.&quot;
<br /><br />Don't argue with an idiot; people watching may not be able to tell the difference.
<br /><br />Wouldn't it be nice if whenever we messed up our life we could simply press 'Ctrl Alt Delete' and start all over? AMEN, AMEN !!
<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it...
<br />Brain cells come and brain cells go, but FATcells live forever.
<br /><br />And remember: life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end, the faster it goes.

<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"> <span class="textAlign textAlignCenter"> 7 reasons the world will end in 2012</span>[u]</span><strong></strong>[/u]
<br /><br />Scientific experts from around the world are genuinely predicting that five years from now, all life on Earth could well finish. Some are saying it'll be humans that set it off. Others believe that a natural phenomenon will be the cause. And the religious folks are saying it'll be God himself who presses the stop button...
<br /><br />1. Mayan Calendar
<br /><br />The first mob to predict 2012 as the end of the world were the Mayans, a bloodthirsty race that were good at two things:
<br /><br />Building highly accurate astrological equipment out of stone and
<br />    Sacrificing Virgins.
<br /><br />Thousands of years ago they managed to calculate the length of the lunar moon as 329.53020 days, only 34 seconds out. The Mayan calendar predicts that the Earth will end on December 21, 2012. Given that they were pretty close to the mark with the lunar cycle, it's likely they've got the end of the world right as well.
<br /><br />2. Sun Storms
<br /><br />Solar experts from around the world monitoring the sun have made a startling discovery: our sun is in a bit of strife. The energy output of the sun is, like most things in nature, cyclic, and it's supposed to be in the middle of a period of relative stability. However, recent solar storms have been bombarding the Earth with so much radiation energy, it's been knocking out power grids and destroying satellites. This activity is predicted to get worse, and calculations suggest it'll reach its deadly peak sometime in 2012
<br /><br />3. The Atom Smasher
<br /><br />Scientists in Europe have been building the world's largest particle accelerator. Basically its a 27km tunnel designed to smash atoms together to find out what makes the Universe tick. However, the mega-gadget has caused serious concern, with some scientists suggesting that it's properly even a bad idea to turn it on in the first place. They're predicting all manner of deadly results, including mini black holes. So when this machine is fired up for its first serious experiment in 2012, the world could be crushed into a super-dense blob the size of a basketball.
<br /><br />4. The Bible says...
<br /><br />If having scientists warning us about the end of the world isn't bad enough,religious folks are getting in on the act aswell. Interpretations of the Christian Bible reveal that the date for Armageddon, the final battle between Good an Evil, has been set down for 2012. The I Ching, also known as the Chinese book of Changes, says the same thing, as do various sections of the Hindu teachings.
<br /><br />5. Super Volcano
<br /><br />Yellowstone National Park in the United States is famous for its thermal springs and Old Faithful geyser. The reason for this is simple - it's sitting on top of the world's biggest volcano, and geological experts are beginning to get nervous sweats. The Yellowstone volcano has a pattern of erupting every 650,000 years or so, and we're many years overdue for an explosion that will fill the atmosphere with ash, blocking the sun and plunging the Earth into a frozen winter that could last up to 15,000 years. The pressure under the Yellowstone is building steadily, and geologists have set 2012 as a likely date for the big bang.
<br /><br />6. The Physicists
<br /><br />This one's case of bog-simple maths mathematics. Physicists at Berekely Uni  have been crunching the numbers. and they've determined that the Earth is well overdue for a major catastrophic event. Even worse, they're claiming their calculations prove, that we're all going to die, very soon - while also saying their prediction comes with a certainty of 99 percent- and 2012 just happens to be the best guess as to when it occurs.
<br /><br />7. Slip-Slop-Slap-BANG!
<br /><br />We all know the Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field that sheilds us from most of the sun's radiation. What you might not know is that the magnetic poles we call north and south have a nasty habit of swapping places every 750,000 years or so - and right now we're about 30,000 years overdue. Scientists have noted that the poles are drifting apart roughly 20-30kms each year, much faster than ever before, which points to a pole-shift being right around the corner. While the pole shift is underway, the magnetic field is disrupted and will eventually disappear, sometimes for up to 100 years. The result is enough UV outdoors to crisp your skin in seconds, killing everything it touches.

While he was there, an attractive young lady comes out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe. Bill smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it's quite obvious that he has nothing under the robe. Poor Bill breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, &quot;Let's go in my apartment, I hear someone coming...&quot;
<br /><br />He proceeds with her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall off completely. Being completely nude, she purrs at him, &quot;What would you say is my best feature?&quot;
<br /><br />The flustered, embarrassed Bill stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out, &quot;Oh, it's got to be your ears!&quot;.
<br /><br />She's astounded! &quot;Why my ears? Looks at these breasts! they are full, don't sag, and they're 100% natural! My buns - they are firm and do not sag, and have no cellulite! Look at this skin, no blemishes, or scars! Why in heaven's name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!&quot;
<br /><br />Clearing his throat once again, Bill stammers - &quot;Outside when you said you heard someone coming - That was me!&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;This should be taken care of right away.&quot;
<br />I'd planned a trip to Hawaii next month but this is so easy and profitable that I want to fix it before it cures itself.
<br /><br />&quot;Welllllll, what have we here...?&quot;
<br />He has no idea and is hoping you'll give him a clue.
<br /><br />&quot;Let me check your medical history.&quot;
<br />I want to see if you've paid your last bill before spending any more time with you.
<br /><br />&quot;Why don't we make another appointment later in the week.&quot;
<br />I'm playing golf this afternoon, and this a waste of time.
<br />--or--
<br />I need the bucks, so I'm charging you for another office visit.
<br /><br />&quot;We have some good news and some bad news.&quot;
<br />The good news is, I'm going to buy that new BMW. The bad news is, you're going to pay for it.
<br /><br />&quot;Let's see how it develops.&quot;
<br />Maybe in a few days it will grow into something that can be cured.
<br /><br />&quot;Let me schedule you for some tests.&quot;
<br />I have a forty percent interest in the lab.
<br /><br />&quot;I'd like to have my associate look at you.&quot;
<br />He's going through a messy divorce and owes me a bundle.
<br /><br />&quot;I'd like to prescribe a new drug.&quot;
<br />I'm writing a paper and would like to use you for a guinea pig.
<br /><br />&quot;If it doesn't clear up in a week, give me a call.&quot;
<br />I don't know what it is. Maybe it will go away by itself.
<br /><br />&quot;That's quite a nasty looking wound.&quot;
<br />I think I'm going to throw up.
<br /><br />&quot;This may smart a little.&quot;
<br />Last week two patients bit off their tongues.
<br /><br />&quot;Well, we're not feeling so well today, are we...?&quot;
<br />I'm stalling for time. Who are you and why are you here?
<br /><br />&quot;This should fix you up.&quot;
<br />The drug company slipped me some big bucks to prescribe this stuff.
<br /><br />&quot;Everything seems to be normal.&quot;
<br />Rats! I guess I can't buy that new beach condo after all.
<br /><br />&quot;I'd like to run some more tests.&quot;
<br />I can't figure out what's wrong. Maybe the kid in the lab can solve this one.
<br /><br />&quot;Do you suppose all this stress could be affecting your nerves?&quot;
<br />You're crazier'n an outhouse rat. Now, if I can only find a shrink who'll split fees with me ...
<br /><br />&quot;There is a lot of that going around.&quot;
<br />My God, that's the third one this week. I'd better learn something about this.
<br /><br />&quot;If those symptoms persist, call for an appointment.&quot;
<br />I've never heard of anything so disgusting. Thank God I'm off next week.
