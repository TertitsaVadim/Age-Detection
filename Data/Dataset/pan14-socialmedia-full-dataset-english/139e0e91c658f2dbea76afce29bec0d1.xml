<br /><br />I think a defining moment in one’s life comes the instant we realize what we could have had. Not that it makes us who we are or that we should spend our lives beating ourselves up over it; however, when these moments come, we often find ourselves in shoulda-coulda-woulda land for at least a short period of time.
<br /><br />I had returned to my hometown after what seemed like forever and a day. In reality, I had only been away a year and a half. My marriage had gone south, and having no close ties to anyone in Kentucky, I came home to Missouri to be near my family and start a new life. I was in a state of chaos and confusion – the emotional roller coaster that often accompanies separation and divorce. I had nary a clue as to what I wanted, where I was going, or even who I was at that point. My marriage had soured me on relationships, so I was certainly in no position to get involved, nor was I capable of recognizing what was there.
<br /><br />I met Billy Joe at the town square. He just happened to sit on the bench beside me, and we started chatting. We hit it off and quickly became involved. I thought he was a great guy: sweet, intelligent, straight forward, brutally honest, yet a gentleman. With Billy, what you saw was what you got. I liked everything about him, and thought he was rather cute too. He was a very young looking 30, with smooth skin, long legs, a nice body, and long, shiny brown hair. He was here for work, had come from Arkansas, and I thought I had hit the jackpot with this sweet southern rock charmer.
<br /><br />I knew I was falling completely, totally, hopelessly head-over-heels for this man. Maybe I couldn’t accept that right then. I know I was scared of being hurt again; jaded by one too many loves-gone-wrong. So, I kept my mouth shut. I never told Billy how I felt. Somewhere in my mind, I had convinced myself that this was not a serious relationship; it was more of a fling or friends with benefits kind of thing.
<br /><br />I started seeing other guys. I mean Billy and I were not exactly a couple, so I didn’t think it would matter. The first clue that it was an issue became clear when he saw me with someone else. The look on his face said it all. Still, he never mentioned it and neither did I. We just went on like usual. Eventually, I moved in with someone I did not really even like just because he wanted me too. I still saw Billy when I could, but eventually our meetings were few and far between.
<br /><br />I missed him all the time, but was still afraid to admit how I felt. Eventually, those hidden feelings backfired on me. Billy was planning to go home and came to see me. I was a wreck, unsure of anything in my life. I didn’t really think he loved me, so I was ready to just give up and move on. His last words to me as he left that day were “Who knows? Maybe in a year or so, we’ll be married.” I didn’t know what to say, so I silently watched as he walked away.
<br /><br />Billy knew how to get a hold of me, and for a while, I held onto hope that he would…don’t we all? By now, I had realized my mistake; I knew he loved me and kept asking myself why I had not run after him or left town with him? His failure to communicate in the beginning or to get in touch afterward was heartbreaking. Nevertheless, I could not lay it all on Billy’s shoulders; after all, I hadn’t said a word either.
<br /><br />For a long time, I moped around – depressed, angry, and very frustrated by what I felt as life throwing one more injustice in my direction. Yes, it was a pity party, and I was the honored guest. Two months after he left town, I found out I was pregnant with Billy Joe’s baby. I was joyous but terribly sad as well. I had no idea how to let Billy know and it mattered very little anyway, as our daughter only survived to the fifth month before I lost her.
<br /><br />After the miscarriage, I tried to rebuild my life. I tried to move on from all the heartache and sorrow. I started working more, meeting people, and doing whatever I could to rebuild the happiness I felt I needed and deserved.
<br /><br />A few months later, I ran into a mutual friend who told me Billy had never made it back to Arkansas. He had gone to a bar for his final night here and was killed by a knife-wielding maniac when he tried to break up a fight.
<br /><br />Since then, it has been 6 years. Time has helped ease the pain and has made things easier to deal with. The good memories are there, and I often miss Billy and wonder what if…
<br /><br />I have moved on in life, have remarried, have a family, a career, and have found the happiness I sought.
<br /><br />I found that time does heal the pain, but you have to work at it a bit and look ahead to find that bright light in your life after such pain. I could have sat back, wishing, wanting, and holding on to a past I had no control over. I could have allowed all the grief to swallow me up. Instead, knowing I had to get on with my own life, I made sure to embrace every opportunity to do so. Sure, I still felt pain and sadness, but it helped tremendously to stop and appreciate the small things in life for their simple beauty. Getting out there and living each day the best I could made time pass easily and pain fade over time. Most of all, I learned never to bottle up my thoughts and emotions. It was good to talk; to remember. Eventually, I could celebrate Billy Joe’s life through the good memories and knew that by moving ahead in my own, I was honoring him.

Even Christmas is not immune to these changes. It has become just a &quot;holiday&quot; to the world—and, sadly, even to some Christians.
<br /><br />&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; has been replaced by &quot;Happy Holidays,&quot; and carols about Jesus have been traded for songs celebrating Santa Claus, winter, family, and friends. Finding Christ-centered Christmas cards has become a challenge. Snowmen and sleighs have taken the place of manger scenes, which were once common in both private and public settings.
<br /><br />This slide away from Christ is the natural progression of the world, but it is not the direction that believers should go. Drifting is easy: you just relax and follow the path of least resistance. But going against the stream requires constant awareness and diligent effort. We must actively guard against letting the world steal Christ from our celebrations.
<br /><br />Christmas is not just a holiday; it is a holy day—the day God came to earth in the flesh of a tiny baby for the purpose of reconciling sinful mankind to Himself. Holidays are numerous, but there is only one Christmas.
<br /><br />The world tries hard to find pleasure in Christ-less holiday observances, but happiness is often elusive when experiences don't match expectations. If you feel a sense of letdown, you may have drifted away from an authentic celebration of Christmas. Allow Jesus back in, and joy will return.
<br /><br />Scripture Of The Day: &quot;And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,[b] for he will save his people from their sins.&quot; - Matthew 1:21 (NLT)

		<document id="e9236970794ee7182ddac32c4f2dfcea" url=""><![CDATA[Part 1 of a Truly Faithful Series Entitled: FLESH vs SPIRIT;<br/><br/>We are seeing a growing number of emails from those struggling with something of a sexual nature! We receive emails daily from all over the world literally and what we get the most is about some sort of sexual struggle from married and singles. We can relate as there was once a similar struggle in our marriage and that is how we learned that &quot;What you feed will GROW.&quot;
<br /><br />Many know about my early struggle with lust in our marriage. I had a lust for THINGS that eventually turned into a lust for another man. Thing was, what REALLY fueled my issues were my THOUGHTS! This is where A LOT of Christians are losing the battle; right in their OWN minds. Because EVERY SINGLE THING whether good or bad that you will do in this life, starts with a THOUGHT! When I had a lust issue, it was because of a THOUGHT! So everything we think of, when fed, it grows. Why? Because &quot;What you feed will GROW.&quot;
<br /><br />After you THINK on those thoughts for so long, you may eventually take action. Remember, no matter if the thoughts are good or bad, you may eventually do what you have been thinking depending on if you feed them. So what do you do? There are MANY things you can do but today we will talk briefly about 2 things you can start doing if you haven't already! #1, Cast down those thoughts. 2 Cor 10:5 says, &quot;Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity EVERY THOUGHT to the obedience of Christ..&quot; That means after you cast the thought down, those thoughts MUST be brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. That is why KNOWING the word is so important. Because one way to cast down those thoughts is to say the scripture that specifically speaks against your sinful thoughts. #2, CONFESS to God and to those in the body of Christ who will listen to and pray for you! James 5:16 is one of my favorite scriptures because when I was struggling with lust, I FINALLY had to confess it to God and then to someone so I could be delivered. And that someone just happened to be my husband and he prayed for me! For all of you who have skyped with my husband and I whether together or with each of us one on one, we end every single call with PRAYER! We KNOW how important it is to pray for those in the body of Christ ESPECIALLY those who are struggling with something!
<br /><br />We won't give you all too much right now because we are sure today is a busy day for everyone and for those who have different celebrations this time of year. But this is the first in a series that God has placed on our hearts to do dealing with our flesh and our minds! So please stay tuned!
<br /><br />Just remember, what you sow to your flesh, will grow and eventually take over the more it's fed because the FLESH is NEVER FULL! It always wants MORE! Your flesh and your spirit need to be fed in order to live because &quot;What you feed will GROW&quot;. But the question is, which will you feed MORE? #StayTuned
<br /><br />Gal 5:17, &quot;For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do&quot;.
<br /><br />Share this with as MANY as you can because too many marriages are suffering because this battle is being lost to the flesh. And too many singles are struggling as well. We got work to do in this area Saints and we can do it through Christ as He will strengthen us to do it! Thank you ALL! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />As we continue to work on our &quot;Flesh vs Spirit&quot; series, we just wanted to stop and share this little reminder as we know many of you will be getting married as the New Year comes in. So we believe it was placed on our hearts to remind those who will be marrying soon to make sure you go into marriage WITH GOD! Don't leave GOD at the place where you will marry, make sure He is IN the marriage as well. Whatever you do, &quot;DON'T FORGET GOD&quot;!
<br /><br />So many people have Him at the wedding but put Him out of the marriage without realizing it. Trust us when we say it is so much better WITH GOD than without! He is in you, LISTEN to Him. He answered your prayers and now you are soon to marry, don't get so caught up in your marriage that you forget Him. Many times we get what we want from God and then we start walking solo. &quot;DON'T FORGET GOD&quot;!
<br /><br />God certainly understands when you FINALLY receive what you've been praying for, that you are very excited. Especially when you have been praying, hoping and wondering for years when it will happen for you, but just remember it was God who answered your prayers with a YES! So we hope you take heed and will continue to honor God no matter single or married. Remember He is the creator of marriage, so don't you think you need Him as you enter into what He created? &quot;DON'T FORGET GOD&quot;!
<br /><br />Hosea 13:6, &quot;When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then THEY FORGOT ME&quot;! #Don'tForgetGod

<br />God can write a story like no other can. His sovereign ability to reach into a person’s future and erect a monument of victory is incomparable. He literally delights in crowning the lowly as prince, and in using the stumbling blocks that have been placed in our paths by others as stepping stones to a throne of His making. 
<br />It’s amazing how he could pull a life from the pit and transform it in such a way that it becomes unrecognizable to the enemy. Such was the life of Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob. From the pit, to the prison, to the palace, Joseph meandered his way to destiny despite the roadblocks he encountered.
<br />.God glorifies His great name in the time of opposition because He specializes in the principle of resurrection. The concept of a thing living again after it had been presumed dead is a wonderful reality in the mind of God. In other words, “It’s not over until God says it’s over.” Certainly, the very life of Christ upon the earth testifies and confirms that there is no opposition – whether it be in the form of a pit or in the form of a grave – that can stop God from reaching down and lifting a life to the place that He has destined for it.
<br />You see, God takes great pleasure in moving a person from the depths of seeming defeat and ushering them to the pinnacle of success. He delights in bringing life out of death and in making “the stone which the builders rejected” into the chief cornerstone (Ps. 118:22). Yes, it is His utmost delight to move beyond your circumstances and do the impossible on your behalf. As a matter of fact, He will ‘flip the script’ until your enemies become your footstool (Ps.110:1) and those who fought against you turn and pray for you to bless them (Ex. 12:32). Indeed, resurrection, restoration, metamorphosis of status, and newness of life are prominent spheres of His mighty dominion.
<br />For this reason, we see Joseph, though severely mistreated in his youth, rising to great power in the very place he was sent to die. He became governor in the land of his captivity and ruled over those to whom he was sold as a slave. Without doubt, Joseph must have understood that though he was ‘persecuted’, he was not ‘abandoned’; and though he was ‘struck down’, he was ‘not destroyed’ (2 Cor. 4:9). Thus, he remained faithful to God and to his vision, and was buoyed by both as God worked behind-the-scenes of his life. In the end, Joseph, the Hebrew slave of the Egyptians, died as Joseph, the Hebrew ruler of the Egyptians.
<br />God finds great pleasure in turning the tables in your favor. His joy is contained in ensuring that you end well. And so now may the God of the ‘turn around’ bring restoration and increase to every area of your life; and may your tomorrow be exceedingly greater than your yesterday. 
<br />Scripture Of The Day: &quot;For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.&quot; - Jeremiah 29:11 (NKJV)

<br /><br />There have been times that my wife has hurt me and it was so deep that I did not want to forgive her. There were times that I have hurt my wife and she did not want to forgive me. In fact over 2 years ago when our marriage was on the rocks, neither of us wanted to forgive each other. We were two believers who were harboring unforgiveness towards one another. I believed I was right, she believed she was right, and we BOTH wanted each other to KNOW that the other was WRONG! But we finally realized that in order to move forward in our marriage there had to be forgiveness. It was not easy to let go of the unfogiveness, but we did. Afterwards, it felt so much better to let go of the hurt and forgive each other!
<br /><br />No matter what ANYONE has done to you, it's time to forgive. You MAY need to go to the people who have hurt you and let them know how you feel. Be led by the Spirit on if you need to do this or not because sometimes, you do need to confront them and other times you may not need to. We realize how hard it is to forgive those who have hurt you especially those who are closest to you, but it's time to forgive so you can finally move on in this area. We will be going into more detail about this in our video of Part 3 in the &quot;Flesh vs Spirit&quot; series, but today we just want to encourage you to forgive your spouse, your family members, your friends, those who have hurt you in the church, those who have broken your heart and whoever else you need to forgive! It's not easy, we know, but it's SO NECESSARY! Remember, LOVE keeps no record of wrongs. (1Cor 13:5). #FORGIVE
<br /><br />Eph 4:23, &quot;Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, FORGIVING ONE ANOTHER, as God in Christ forgave you&quot;.
<br /><br />Mark 11:25, &quot;And whenever you stand praying, FORGIVE, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may FORGIVE you your trespasses.”
<br /><br />Col 3:13, &quot;Bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, FORGIVING each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must FORGIVE&quot;.

<br /><br />Another Truly Faithful Message on FORGIVENESS!
<br /><br />She cheated on you, she embarrassed you in front of your family and friends, she hit you and called you unheard of names, she puts you down in front of your children, she lies and says you do things you know you don’t do, she’s caused you so much hell, pain and more, yet she may NEVER repent for what she has done. FORGIVE HER!
<br /><br />He abused you, he hurt you deep, he cheated on you, he verbally abused you, he neglected you and put everyone else before you. He left you, he doesn’t take care of the children, he flirts with other women yet says he's committed to you, he's broken promises and so much more, yet he may NEVER repent for what he's done. FORGIVE HIM!
<br /><br />They're supposed to be family but they stabbed you in the back, they keep saying they're sorry but you know they don't mean it, they put you down about almost anything, they're supposed to be your friends yet they keep hurting you and they've cause you so much pain! FORGIVE THEM!
<br /><br />Those are just a few examples of the wrongs people have done to many yet Believers still have to forgive them. And I’m here to tell you it's not easy. The guy who raped me…can I be honest? I wanted to PHYSICALLY hurt him back! I wanted him to suffer as he made me suffer. I hated him for YEARS yet I was drawn to him. Drawn to finding out what he was doing in his life, hoping he was not doing well, hoping he was being paid back for what he had done to me. Crazy I know, but I will go into more detail about that at a later time. But when I was 20 years old, I found out he had married and started a family and I was BEYOND PISSED that he appeared happy and had gotten away with violating me. But that was the thing, he had moved on and I had not.
<br /><br />Why do many of us struggle to forgive people? Well for me, it was because I wanted them to PAY for what they did and I wanted to SEE how they paid for it! I wanted them to admit it and just apologize. And for the most part, I just wanted those who wronged me, AT THE VERY LEAST, to admit they were WRONG! But I have learned, it’s not going to always happen that way which is why it’s so important to forgive anyway!
<br /><br />In early 2005, I was FINALLY ready to confront my Dad about the physical abuse of my Mom and I. Instead of going to see him, I wrote a detailed letter asking him why he did those things and I also shared with him how it caused me to feel towards him etc. He actually wrote me back which was surprising because we lived in the same town. When the letter came in the mail, I was shaking as I held it. I was so afraid to read it that I never opened it. My best friend at the time was at our apartment so she read the letter while my husband sat next to me. Til this day, I really wished I had NEVER read his response, but I am glad that I wrote the letter so that he knew how I felt. But basically he did not see things the way that I saw them and he believed the beatings were justified. Though I was hurting more because of his response, I realized it was time to let it go! I told him how I felt, he responded and now I had a choice to make. Either I was going to forgive him and continue to live in the spiritual prison of unforgiveness or forgive him and let it go!
<br /><br />I never responded to his letter, I just didn’t talk to him for several months. So when Thanksgiving came around I battled whether or not I should go to see him. I went against my flesh and my husband and I went to his home where other family was visiting as well. When I went inside, I gave my Dad the biggest hug I had given him since before I left for college. We went on like there never were letters exchanged between us. I knew I had forgiven him when I hugged him and I don’t regret it for one second. Did my Dad come clean? Not really. Did he confess to all that he did? No. Did he learn how I had been feeling? Yes. But in the end, none of that matters as I was the one who had to forgive him and I did!
<br /><br />It took me over 13 years to forgive him, but today I can say that when it comes to talking about my past of physical abuse, I AM FREE! I can share and encourage people in this area without getting upset about it or hating my Dad. When my husband shared about forgiveness earlier, he was so right about how hard it can be to forgive those closest to you. Forgiveness doesn’t mean you agree with what they did to you, it just means you release the grudge you have against them.
<br /><br />So as my husband’s post said earlier, “No matter what ANYONE has done to you, it's time to forgive. It's not easy, we know, but it's SO NECESSARY”! And the thing is, we KNOW we should forgive, it’s just hard to do so. But this is what Christ does best, He helps us in everthing. Remember, apart from Him we can do NOTHING, but THROUGH HIM we can do ALL THINGS, including FORGIVE!
<br /><br />John 15:5, &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for APART FROM ME UPI CAN DO NOTHING&quot;. If Christ is really in you and you are really in Him, no matter how hard it is, you CAN FORGIVE. The question is WILL YOU?
<br /><br />Luke 6:46, &quot;Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say&quot;?
<br /><br />Mark 11:25, &quot;And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, FORGIVE him, so that your Father in heaven may FORGIVE you your sins&quot;. #FORGIVE
<br /><br />Share this with as MANY as you can! Thank you ALL! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

For many reading this, 2011 has been a year of processing, shaping, formatting and fitting. Yes, the trials and hard times came, and are still here, but we have to really know and believe that they came, and are still here, only to make us strong. 
<br />Dear brothers and sisters, whenever trouble comes your way, let it be an opportunity for joy. For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything. (James 1:2-4, NLT).
<br />In the year to come 2012, we can still experience God “having our back.” Stay away from the love of money; be satisfied with what you have. For God has said, “I will never fail you. I will never forsake you.” That is why we can say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper, so I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?” (Hebrews 13:5-6, NLT). And we can still give him what he wants presented from us. &quot;And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable.&quot; When you think of what he has done for you, is this too much to ask? (Romans 12:1, NLT).
<br />We must have confidence deep down within that only comes from God the Father. We must know who we are in him and move forward in him. If there are folks running the race with you on the ‘track field’ who want to turn around or want to stop running and stay behind, you may have to tell them “Okay, I’ll see you later! 2012 for me is going to be a year of experiencing that vision, dream, or promise that I’ve been working on, holding on to, and waiting on God to do and complete through me.”
<br />As this year comes to an end, there is one thing we can say: we’ve survived! A survivor is one who has remained existent and outlasted the circumstance and situation; one who didn’t give up, but hung in there. We’ve made it to the finishing line. Now all we have to do is cross over into 2012 and start a new ‘workout’ (processing, shaping, formatting, fitting), getting us ready for the upcoming experiences mentioned above. In the ‘workout,’ we have to put our total trust, increased faith, and dependency in and upon the coach of our ‘track team,’ the Lord our God.
<br />Scripture Of The Day: “For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything.” - James 1:3-4 (NLT)

<br /><br />I remember I was in the grocery store with my oldest daughter who was 4 at the time and this guy tried to talk to me. It was weird because I had already told him I was married, but that wasn't enough. So when he persisted, I then told him I was Happily Married. Nothing doing. This guy continued to &quot;try to holla&quot; even though my daughter was with me. I then walked somewhat towards the grocery store windows and motioned for him to come as well. As he walked up I said, &quot;See that car right there&quot;? He said, &quot;Yeah&quot;. I said, &quot;Look real close. You see that man in the car&quot;? He looked and answered, &quot;Yeah&quot; in a tone wondering what I was getting at. I said, &quot;That's my HUSBAND! If you want to go home with me, you have to ask him&quot;. He then said, &quot;Oh it's like that&quot;? I said, &quot;Oh yes, not only is it like that because I fear God but, it's also like that because 'HE TAKES CARE OF HOME&quot;! End of discussion!
<br /><br />I was at a church event earlier this year (yes THE CHURCH) and while my husband was talking to some brothers in the Lord, I was in line getting us food. This man was in line behind me &quot;trying&quot; to flirt with me under his breath. (I say trying because nobody can flirt with me but my husband). He claimed to know that Pastors wives were some of the loneliest women on earth and that we need attention too. At first it was funny because he was an older guy who was a deacon in the church and I thought maybe he was a little &quot;touched&quot;. In other words, touched with the bottle (alcohol). But then he kept persisting that I must be lonely and needed attention; attention he claimed only he could give me. SMH! I had to tell him as well, &quot;Not only do I fear God, but the pastor you claim is neglecting me, 'HE TAKES CARE OF HOME&quot;! That ended that discussion too!
<br /><br />It amazes me the amount of men who do not care that you are married. And it doesn't seem to matter if you have a ring on your finger or not. I used to have a saying when I was more carnal minded that said, &quot;Game recognize Game&quot; and that meant I could recognize someone trying to run game on me because I played those same games as an unbeliever. But now my saying is this, &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&quot;. (Eph 6:12). Listen wives, we do NOT have time for that foolishness. I certainly don't have time for it as I have already hurt my husband while we were newlyweds for not letting a man know where to go but instead I entertained his demonic advances. This message is to put it out there to the wives: don't let satan trip you up with these men trying to &quot;flattery talk you&quot; knowing full well you are married. Whether you are happily married or enduring in your marriage, know that when these men try to talk to you, it is not only them, but also the enemy trying to get a rise in you by using them. Especially those of you who are enduring in your marriages, because satan plays for keeps and he wants you and your marriage to fail. But even if your husband may not be taking care of home like he should right now, know that God ALWAYS takes care of home so you will still be right to tell those men, &quot;HE TAKES CARE OF HOME&quot;!
<br /><br />2Cor 2:11, &quot;Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices&quot;.
<br /><br />1Peter 5:8, &quot;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour&quot;! Be alert wives!
<br /><br />Though this message can be flipped around for the husbands, I believe my husband will post for the husbands soon! #HeTakesCareOfHomeBecauseGodTakesCareofHim
<br /><br />Share this with as MANY as you can. If you have problems sharing, let us know and we will send it to you! Thank you ALL! :-

A Truly Faithful message to H<br/><br/>My wife sent the cows home this morning on her post about &quot;He Takes Care Of Home&quot;! LOL! So I want to share with husbands that sometimes we may have to, &quot;RUN LIKE JOSEPH&quot;!
<br /><br />One of the hardest things for me in my marriage has been restraint after my wife has had one of our children. Because her pregnancies have been hard, her recovery is always longer than normal, so I have to really practice restraint while my wife recovers. I remember shortly after the premature birth of our first born, my wife and daughter were both in the hospital. I was getting weak because it had been some time since my wife and I had sex and I really needed her. One day at work, a woman who most of the men gawked at, walked passed me purposely a few times. I maintained my faithfulness to God and my wife by not looking upon her even though I was tempted. Why was I tempted? It's true, I was weak and needing sex and intimacy from my wife and this was the FIRST time since we had been married that we couldn't have regular sex, so my flesh was &quot;TRYING&quot; to act up. Don't worry fellas, I held my own in Christ and NEVER lusted. But this woman stopped to PURPOSELY ask me a question that made no sense. I kept looking at the picture of my newborn baby daughter and never looked at her again. She wanted my attention but she couldn't have it. She was trying to lean over my desk, so I got up and RAN LIKE JOSEPH!
<br /><br />Where did I run? I ran to my Savior and was strengthened because my Spirit was willing but my flesh was weak! I didn't have time to entertain foolishness or the wayward woman. You may say that was mean of me to call her the wayward woman, but if you ever look in the word of God, it talks about how the wayward woman pursues men especially married men and that she even lies in wait for them (Prov 23:38). Do you know what &quot;lies in wait&quot; mean? It means that someone sits back unseen and waits for someone to pass by and then they attack or ambush them by surprise. That's what she was doing. She was trying to lure me in, especially being dressed in her provocative work attire. Not only did she know I was married, but she KNEW my wife was in the hospital and had just had my first child through a life and death situation. Did she care? NO! Why? Because the enemy does not care about me, my wife, my children or ANY OF US! The enemy ONLY cares about who and what he can destroy! (John 10:10, 1Peter 5:8). I can resist the devil and He will flee, but when it comes to a woman trying to pursue me and her name is not Octavia, I don't have time to play with the &quot;rebuking satan game&quot; and conversing back and forth with the wayward woman, I instead leave her where she stands and RUN LIKE JOSEPH!
<br /><br />Let me say this husbands. This is not a game! Like my wife said, satan is playing for keeps and wants to destroy our marriages and our very souls. If you are entertaining other women outside of your wife, you are playing with fire and you will burn unless you repent, LITERALLY! God is SERIOUS about our marital covenants! He's SERIOUS about us husbands being faithful to HIM FIRST and then faithful to &quot;the wives of our youth&quot; (Mal 2:15)! God understands our struggles but He is not pleased with us cheating on our wives with our eyes nor the actual act of adultery. Start bouncing your eyes men and RUN LIKE JOSEPH if you have to! This is how I bounce my eyes, if a woman comes into my view or I happen to look at her, I bounce my eye off of her and look elsewhere. I have done this so much now that it's a habit! Don't get me wrong, I am not afraid to look and talk to any woman fearing that I may sin because I have to preach the gospel, but I do follow the leading of the Holy Spirit that lets me know when it's a setup or not! Some women will try to talk to me but cover it up with talks of &quot;I need to counsel with the pastor&quot;. I let them know who my wife is and that they can &quot;counsel&quot; with her. When they never contact her, I know it was a setup to begin with!
<br /><br />Remember earlier my wife gave you Eph 6:12 about we wrestle not against flesh and blood, well that's what's going on! Husbands you need to recognize that whether women try to pursue you OR you are out there pursing women outside of your marriage, in the end, it's all a setup by satan and you are not to be ignorant. And I'm just going to be blunt, if you are ignorant, it's because you CHOOSE TO BE and you enjoy your sin more than pleasing God and your wife! So don't perish for lack of knowledge, study His word and get around men who are being Truly Faithful to Christ and to their wives! So I'm not telling you to be careful, I'm telling you TO RUN LIKE JOSEPH and into the arms of our Father so you can be strengthened!
<br /><br />Gen 39:11-12, &quot;One day, Joseph went to Potiphar's house to do his work, and none of the other servants were there. Potiphar's wife grabbed hold of his coat and said, &quot;Make love to me!&quot; Joseph ran out of the house, LEAVING HER HANGING...&quot; Now the rest of that scripture says &quot;leaving her hanging onto his coat&quot;, but I left it off to show you that, that's what you may have to do at times; Run Like Joseph and LEAVE HER HANGING! #YouAin'tNoPunkIfYouRun
<br /><br />Share with as MANY as you can! Thank you ALL! :-

It's best defined as the ability to regulate one’s conduct by principle and sound judgment, rather than by impulse, desire, or social custom. Biblically, self-discipline may be summarized in one word: obedience. To exercise self-discipline is to avoid evil by staying within the bounds of God’s law. People who have the ability to concentrate, focus on their goals, and consistently stay within their priorities tend to succeed. Whether in academics, the arts, or athletics, success generally comes to the self-disciplined.
<br />Since self-discipline is so important, how do you develop it? How can parents help their children develop it? Here are some practical tips that I've found helpful:
<br /><br />Start with small things. Clean your room at home or your desk at work. Train yourself to put things where they belong when they are out of place. Make the old adage &quot;A place for everything and everything in its place&quot; your motto. After you've cleaned your room or desk, extend that discipline of neatness to the rest of your house and workplace. Get yourself to the point where orderliness matters. Learn how to keep your environment clean and clear so you can function without a myriad of distractions. Such neatness will further develop self-discipline by forcing you to make decisions about what is important and what is not.
<br />Learning self-discipline in the little things of life prepares the way for big successes. On the other hand, those who are undisciplined in small matters will likely be undisciplined in more important issues. In the words of Solomon, it is the little foxes that ruin the vineyards (Song of Sol. 2:15). And when it comes to a person's integrity and credibility, there are no small issues.
<br />Get yourself organized. Make a schedule, however detailed or general you are comfortable with, and stick to it. Have a to-do list of things you need to accomplish. Using a daily planning book or a personal information manager program on your computer would be helpful. But get organized, even if all you do is jot down appointments and to-do items on a piece of scrap paper. The simple reality is that if you don't control your time, everything (and everyone) else will.
<br /><br />Don't constantly seek to be entertained. When you have free time, do things that are productive instead of merely entertaining. Read a good book, listen to classical music, take a walk, or have a conversation with someone. In other words, learn to entertain yourself with things that are challenging, stimulating, and creative. Things that are of no value except to entertain you make a very small contribution to your well-being.
<br /><br />Be on time. If you're supposed to be somewhere at a specific time, be there on time. The apostle Paul listed proper use of time as a mark of true spiritual wisdom: &quot;Be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil&quot; (Eph. 5:15-16). Being punctual marks a life that is organized. It reveals a person whose desires, activities, and responsibilities are under control. Being on time also acknowledges the importance of other people and the value of their time.
<br /><br />Keep your word. &quot;Undertake not what you cannot perform, If you say you're going to do something, do it—when you said you would do it and how you said you would do it. When you make commitments, see them through. That calls for the discipline to properly evaluate whether you have the time and capability to do something. And once you’ve made the commitment, self-discipline will enable you to keep it.
<br /><br />Do the most difficult tasks first. Most people do just the opposite, spending their time doing the easier, low priority tasks. But when they run out of time (and energy), the difficult, high-priority tasks are left undone.
<br /><br />Finish what you start. Some people's lives are a sad litany of unfinished projects. In the words of poet John Greenleaf Whittier,
<br />For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: &quot;It might have been!&quot;
<br />If you start something, finish it. Therein lies an important key to developing self-discipline.
<br /><br />Accept correction. Correction helps you develop self-discipline by showing you what you need to avoid. Thus, it should not be rejected, but accepted gladly. Solomon wrote &quot;Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days&quot; (Prov. 19:20); and &quot;He whose ear listens to the life giving reproof will dwell among the wise. He who neglects discipline despises himself, but he who listens to reproof acquires understanding&quot; (Prov. 15:31-32).
<br /><br />Practice self-denial. Learn to say no to your feelings and impulses. Occasionally deny yourself pleasures that are perfectly legitimate for you to enjoy. Skip dessert after a meal. Don't eat that doughnut that caught your eye. Refraining from those things will remind your body who is in charge.
<br /><br />Welcome responsibility. Volunteer to do things that need to be done. That will force you to have your life organized enough to have the time for such projects.
<br />These practical suggestions may not seem to involve any deep spiritual principles. Yet you cannot split your life into the secular and the spiritual. Instead you must live every aspect of your life to the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31). And self-discipline cultivated in the seemingly mundane things of life will spill over into the spiritual realm.

I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do.&quot; 1 Samuel 10:8 (NIV)
<br />God had given Saul specific directions from the prophet Samuel on how to win in a battle Saul was going through. Saul was instructed to go to Gilgal and wait on Samuel to come and offer a sacrifice unto God. Then Saul would be told what to do next in his life. But in 1 Samuel 13:8-14, we find that Saul did not wait and did not follow what the Lord told him to do.
<br />“He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. “What have you done?” asked Samuel. Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” “You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the LORD’s command.” (NIV)
<br />Saul did not wait on the timing of God's direction. He started looking at the situation around him. He began to see, in the natural, the men beginning to leave; the men he was counting on. He began to fear and think, “My enemy is going to come into this territory and attack me.” Then he began to feel, “I will take matters into my own hands and not follow The Word given to me. It’s getting too late, The Word or promise given to me is not happening, I will just stop waiting and believing that God will come through for me. This is just taking too long!”
<br />Is that where you are right now? Are you like Saul, looking at how hard it’s getting? Are you beginning to move according to what is going on around you?
<br />Saul’s promise was coming. The manifestation of his promise from God was on its way; it was moving on the road toward him! His promise was almost there when Saul decided to quit waiting, watching, believing and speaking what God said. His breakthrough was on its way. The change in his situation that he had been waiting on was just a few moments in time from him, and Saul gave up and canceled it all to discover that “Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived.”
<br />That’s what God wants you to know. He knows what time it is. He loves you and He will keep His Word – will you? Are we going to give up because it looks like it is getting late? Are we going to try to make a breakthrough happen by ourselves and in our own power?
<br />Decide today to dig your spiritual heels in the ground and not give up! You shall finish strong!
<br />Scripture Of The Day: &quot;Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.&quot; - Psalm 27:14 (NIV)

We also ask if you would please share this post with EVERYONE you can in hopes that it may encourage others!
<br /><br />If you watched part 2 of our &quot;Happy New Year #2012&quot; video on our youtube channel, you may remember when we said we were facing something in this new year that had to be taken care of. It's not a big thing to others we are sure, but it was HUGE to us. We were facing having our electricity disconnected early morning Jan 3rd. We did the video on January 1st and we had NO IDEA how we were going to pay over $300 for this bill. While $300 used to be NOTHING to have sitting in our bank account, this past year it has been hard to come by.
<br /><br />While praying in the New Year with our children we made our requests known to God again about this bill as we had been doing whatever we could to come up with it. Even though I'm the head, I didn't know what else to do. My wife on the other hand was like, &quot;We're going to have to ask for help...AGAIN&quot;! While it used to be that I HATED asking anyone for help especially being the head, THIS TIME I didn't care as I could not live with myself if my wife and children were in the dark and in a cold house. My wife told me two men to ask and of those 2 men, one gave and the other prayed. A guy in our town came through as well, but here's the thing, when I called the electric company they said that 3 people had paid $100 each and that was on Jan 2nd. My wife and I were wondering who was the third person. Then one more person paid another $100 on the MORNING that our electricity was to be disconnected which was Jan 3rd. Our bill was then paid in full with a little bit over towards the next bill due in the middle of this month. As of today, we STILL don't know who the other person was, but get this; of the 4 people who paid $100 each, we have only met 1 of them EVER in person, the other 2 are fb friends and the other person is anonymous. IS OUR GOD NOT GOOD? MY GOD, MY GOD!
<br /><br />There was NO PANICKING from us! No bad attitudes, no acting out in frustration, NO FEAR! We just prayed, believed, trusted and had FAITH in God, BUT we also put our faith into action by ASKING. While we believe wholeheartedly in trusting and having faith in God, we also believe in putting in the work when we are supposed to as well. We are to do ALL WE CAN while God will do WHAT WE CAN NOT! *praising God still as I just looked in on our children sleeping in their warm beds*
<br /><br />Financial problems have been known to be the reason MANY marriages fail, but in our case our marriage has grown stronger. Why? Because our faith is not in money, it's in GOD! That's our small testimony for this New Year. Now what's yours?
<br /><br />Psalm 37:25, &quot;I was young and now I am old, yet I have NEVER seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.&quot;
<br /><br />Share this with as MANY as you can! Thank you ALL! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />As we get ready to start our series on “Sexual Sin” it’s time to just tell God the whole truth and nothing but! No need to beat around the bush and pretend, no need to use religious clichés, just go ahead and be real with the God of Truth! We have talked about confessing, repenting, renewing minds and WORKING so much lately because GOD is leading us to do so. He obviously SEES IT ALL and wants His people DELIVERED! So now is the time to &quot;GO BOLDLY TO GOD ABOUT YOUR SIN&quot;!
<br /><br />When I was going to commit adultery, it was because I WANTED TO. I was not struggling in my thoughts; I was giving into my thoughts and ENJOYING THEM! When that guy would come around, I enjoyed him flirting with me. Now it was true, when I was with my husband, I was with my husband and was not thinking about the guy, but as soon as I was at work and he came around, my thoughts went to work as I allowed his flirting to fuel my thoughts. The truth was I wanted to have my cake and eat it too. What am I saying? Ok, I will quote my OWN WORDS from my story: &quot;I knew in my heart what was going to happen if he and I met at the house alone but I WANTED TO GO ANYWAY. My thoughts were wrong and I was convicted, but my flesh wanted what it wanted and IT WANTED TO BE FULFILLED”.
<br /><br />I wanted to sin, I wanted to give into my flesh. WHY? Because I loved my sinful thoughts and my flesh enjoyed them. So I got HONEST ABOUT THEM! As hard as it was for me to SAY them, and as hard as it was for me to CONFESS the truth, I did it because I wanted to be delivered. So I confessed to GOD on the way home. I poured my heart out to MY GOD which is why I was so convicted to tell my husband. But my confession to God was not, “Lord, I’m struggling with my thoughts”, no my confession was, “Lord I’m enjoying his advances, the impure thoughts and I want to give into my flesh sexually”. I went BOLDLY to God about MY SIN!
<br /><br />The point of this post is this; you can talk all day about your sin, but if you don’t BOLDLY go to God about it, you are not being 100% real with God or yourself. Tell GOD the whole truth and nothing but and say it out loud if you have to. If it’s porn just say it. “Dear Heavenly Father, I love to watch porn and masturbate. It makes me feel good while doing it, even though I may feel guilty afterwards. I am addicted but I love this addiction”. Watch what happens when you HEAR yourself say those words. You just may feel like I did when I boldly went to God about my sin: so DISGUSTED AND EMBARRASSED before God that it may cause you to WORK to renew your mind RIGHT THEN! If you REALLY want deliverance, you will COME CLEAN and GO BOLDLY before GOD and bare it all. So keep it ONE HUNDRED with your Savior. Let me start it off for you with a bold confession of prayer of my own!
<br /><br />&quot;Lord, I AM SELFISH AND I LOVE HAVING MY WAY. My husband asks me to do things and the reason I don’t do them right away is because I don’t want to stop doing what I am doing to obey him. In fact God, sometimes I am mad that my husband asks me to do things WHILE I’m in the middle of doing something. I want him to do what I ask, but when it comes to doing what he asks me to do, it really depends on what he asks Lord because if it’s ANYTHING I don’t ‘feel’ like doing, I delay and make excuses because I am selfish and I love being selfish&quot;!
<br /><br />There I said it! Now let me finish! “Lord, even though I am selfish and I love it, I do NOT want to continue to be this way because it does not bring you glory, it only brings me glory and that is stealing glory that is rightfully yours! Help me Lord to renew my mind in being more SELFLESS. Help me not to write what you want me to write on this page to help others but not APPLY it to myself as well! Father, forgive me for not honoring you or my head in this area! I want to do the WORK that I need to do to be delivered from selfishness. Hold me accountable directly from you LORD, through my husband and the two older wives in the Lord who often encourage, correct, rebuke and love me with your love and your word. You said in your word that I am to esteem others above myself and that I am to submit to and reverence my husband. So when I am selfish, I am disobeying my husband, your word and YOU! Create in me a clean heart and renew a right spirit within in me so that I can obey you because you said only those who do the will of the Father will make it in! I repent LORD and NOW I will do the WORK to be more selfless as I can do ALL things through CHRIST who strengthens me! Give me opportunities to SHOW that I am WORKING to be more selfless Lord as I am ready to please YOU FIRST and then my Covering whether he is selfless with me or NOT. In JESUS name I pray! AMEN”!
<br /><br />I don’t have time to play with God or give Him lip service, I need deliverance and I need and WANT IT NOW! DO YOU? If so, Man up and Woman up and &quot;GO BOLDLY TO GOD ABOUT YOUR SIN&quot;! Then WORK to renew your mind and repent so you can be restored. AS THERE CAN BE NO RESTORATION OR DELIVERANCE FROM GOD, WITHOUT CONFESSING AND REPENTING TO GOD! #BeReal
<br /><br />Heb 4:16, “Let us therefore come BOLDLY to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need&quot;. And our time of need is NOW! Look how MERCIFUL our God is ready to be with us!!!

<br /><br />I thank God for a husband who is Truly Faithful, but now I have to be there for him, even though I am still grieving the death of my Grandmother. Why should I do this? Because even though I am going through, &quot;HE NEEDS ME TOO&quot;.
<br /><br />I wrote a post the other day entitled &quot;GO BOLDLY TO GOD ABOUT YOUR SIN&quot;! In that post, I boldly confessed that I was SELFISH! I also prayed and then asked God to &quot;...give me opportunities to SHOW that I am WORKING to be more selfless...&quot;. Well today I have the opportunity to be SELFLESS and be there for him as he and his side of the family deal with the death of a loved one and they are not sure whether that loved one accepted Christ before he died or not.
<br /><br />Yes I am still hurting, yes I am still grieving, yes I am concerned about my Dad as he is also not a believer, but I can not be so consumed with my thoughts, hurt and pain and not notice that my husband needs comforting. Even though I have my own things going on, &quot;MY HUSBAND NEEDS ME TOO&quot;!
<br /><br />There is a reason the word tells us to &quot;carry each other's burdens&quot; and to &quot;esteem others above ourselves&quot;. I believe it's so that we will remember that it's not about us all the time, but it's about God ALL of the time and then others. And also so that we not have to go through things alone in this life. I am forever grateful of the love my husband shows me on a DAILY BASIS and especially when I am in pain. But at this moment, I'm going to have to be STRONG and allow the Lord to be there for me, so that I can be there for my husband as &quot;HE NEEDS ME TOO&quot;!
<br /><br />We will continue to encourage you all to be more SELFLESS and be there for your mates as well as family members and friends in their times of need. Even if that means that the Lord will have to comfort you WHILE you comfort others, still be there for them. Remember, we are not to be selfish and get caught up in our own issues because, &quot;OTHERS NEED US TOO&quot;! #BeEncouraged and thank you all for your prayers! :'-)
<br /><br />Gal 6:2, &quot;Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ&quot;.
<br /><br />Rom 15:1, &quot;Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves&quot;.
<br /><br />Phil 2:4, &quot;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others&quot;.
<br /><br />Be selfless and be there for others in their time of need! Please share this with as MANY as you can! Thank you ALL! <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />For these few moments, I was mesmerized.
<br />I was taken aback because of all the cool things she could do. Thinking back to when she was a little baby, I recalled her first day on earth. Looking at her now, a full 14 years later I was…speechless. Not only was she smart, talented, and amazing, but she was also…beautiful.
<br />She looked just like her mother this morning, hair swept in a thick braid twisting down her neck to slender shoulders. She walked just like her mom this morning, gliding across the kitchen floor with unusual grace. In many ways, my 12 year-old princess has become a younger version of my wife. Her face is so much like her face. It held me in spellbound awe. It made me think of the genesis of our earliest beginnings.
<br />You and I come from God. We were created in His image, and carry shades of His likeness. Sadly because of the Fall of Man, this connection can be difficult to see. Because of sin’s presence, human nature is fragmented and schizophrenic. Like Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, where the principle character routinely manifested both horror and beauty; as human beings we are prone to a similar duplicity.
<br />Deep in the human heart’s core there is a battle being waged. Between light and dark, good and evil, heaven and hell. A war. A conflict. Over image. Likeness. Genetics. Blueprints. Natures. For faces.
<br /> As in, whose likeness will we allow ourselves to be fashioned in? The One who designed us, or the Devil that comes to pervert what God created? Will we be children of light, or the offspring of darkness? Will we put on His face? Or his face? Every day this battle is waged. On the basis of how we choose, how we act, and how we live, will determine whose image we will ultimately reflect.
<br />Today…what face will be your face?
<br />Scripture Of The Day: “So God created man in his own image, ?in the image of God he created him; ?male and female he created them.”? -Genesis 1:27

You won’t be free except you forgive that person and forget. By not forgiving someone no matter the hurt, you are imprisoning your self but when you forgive you immediately punish that person, you may not know but showing your offenders love is heaping hot coals on him or her.
<br /><br />Looking at the teaching of Christ He said forgive your offender for 70 x 7, times, that is 490 times.Matthew 18:21-22. He said this because for you to be counting the number of times a person offends you or keeping records, shows that you have not forgiven the person but waiting to retaliate. If truly you have forgiven someone even if the person offends you 1000 times it will seem as if it is the first time so it would not amount to 490.
<br /><br />More still, a lot of people forgive but do not understand the forgetting aspect so they have not forgiven that person. Listen to this, forgetting what that person did to you does not signify that you cannot think of it or you would not remember it. Forgive and forget means that even when you remember or think of it you read another perspective to it. That is, instead of getting angry you laugh over it.
<br /><br />Finally God will not forgive you if you do not forgive your neighbors or friends, so watch it, because you offend God sometimes once in a while or even most times. You are blessed in Jesus Name Amen.Be blessed.

<br />Posted by phemyodu on December 6, 2011
<br /><br />Really heart touching………
<br /><br />I was walking around in a Big Bazar store making shopping, when I saw
<br />a Cashier talking to a boy couldn’t have been more than 5 or 6 years
<br />old..
<br /><br />TheCashier said, ‘I’m sorry, but you don’t have enough money to buy
<br />this doll. Then the little boy turned to me and asked: ”Uncle, are
<br />you sure I don’t have enough money?”
<br /><br />I counted his cash and replied: ”You know that you don’t have enough
<br />money to buy the doll, my dear.” The little boy was still holding the
<br />doll in his hand.
<br /><br />Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give
<br />this doll to. ‘It’s the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so
<br />much . I wanted to Gift her for her BIRTHDAY.
<br /><br />I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my
<br />sister when she goes there.’ His eyes were so sad while saying this.
<br />‘My Sister has gone to be with God.. Daddy says that Mommy is going to
<br />see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with
<br />her to give it to my sister…”
<br /><br />My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said: ‘I
<br />told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I
<br />come back from the mall.’ Then he showed me a very nice photo of him
<br />where he was laughing. He then told me ‘I want mommy to take my
<br />picture with her so my sister won’t forget me.’ ‘I love my mommy and I
<br />wish she doesn’t have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go
<br />to be with my little sister.’ Then he looked again at the doll with
<br />sad eyes, very quietly..
<br /><br />I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. ‘Suppose we check
<br />again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll?”
<br /><br />‘OK’ he said, ‘I hope I do have enough.’ I added some of my money to
<br />his with out him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough
<br />for the doll and even some spare money.
<br /><br />The little boy said: ‘Thank you God for giving me enough money!’
<br /><br />Then he looked at me and added, ‘I asked last night before I went to
<br />sleep for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll, so
<br />that mommy could give It to my sister. He heard me!” ‘I also wanted
<br />to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn’t
<br />dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll
<br />and a white rose. My mommy loves white roses.’
<br /><br />I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I
<br />started. I couldn’t
