<br />Jack wakes up at home with a huge hangover he can't believe. He forces himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirin next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! 
<br />Jack sits down and sees his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. Jack looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror, and notices a note on the table: 
<br /><br />&quot;Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to go shopping--Love you!&quot; 
<br /><br />He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating. 
<br /><br />Jack asks &quot;Son...what happened last night?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, you came home after 3 am, drunk and out of your mind. You broke some furniture, puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;So, why is everything in such perfect order, so clean, I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me?&quot; His son replies,&quot;Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bedroom, and when she tried to take your trousers off, you screamed, &quot;Leave me alone, you tart, I'm married! Broken furniture £85.26 
<br /><br />Hot Breakfast £4.20 
<br /><br />Red Rose bud £3.00 
<br /><br />Two Aspirins £0.38 
<br /><br />Saying the right thing, at the right time.........Priceless

<br />TO MY DEAR WIFE: 
<br /><br />During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. 
<br /><br />I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. 
<br /><br />The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 
<br /><br />54 times the sheets were clean 
<br />17 times it was too late 
<br />49 times you were too tired 
<br />20 times it was too hot 
<br />15 times you pretended to be sleep 
<br />22 times you had a headache 
<br />17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
<br />16 times you said you were too sore 
<br />12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
<br />19 times you had to get up early 
<br />9 times you said weren't in the mood 
<br />7 times you were sunburned 
<br />6 times you were watching the late show 
<br />5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
<br />3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
<br />9 times you said your mother would hear us 
<br /><br />Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 
<br /><br />6 times you just laid there 
<br />8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
<br />4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
<br />7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
<br />1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 
<br /><br />===================================================== 
<br /><br />TO MY DEAR HUSBAND: 
<br /><br />I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
<br /><br />5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
<br />36 times you did not come home at all 
<br />21 times you didn't cum 
<br />33 times you came too soon 
<br />19 times you went soft before you got in 
<br />38 times you worked too late 
<br />10 times you got cramps in your toes 
<br />29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
<br />2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls  
<br />4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
<br />3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
<br />2 times you had a splinter in your finger 
<br />20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
<br />6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
<br />98 times you were too busy watching TV 
<br /><br />Of the times we did get together: 
<br /><br />The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets.
<br /><br />I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, &quot;Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?&quot;
<br /><br />The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe

<br />These 4 gents go out to play golf one sunny morning. One is detained in the clubhouse, and the other three are discussing their children while walking to the first tee. 
<br />&quot;My son Kent,&quot; says one, &quot;has made quite a name for himself in the home-building industry. He began as a carpenter, but now owns his own design and construction firm. He's so successful in fact, in the last year he was able to give a good friend a brand new home as a gift.&quot; 
<br /><br />The second man, no to be out done, tells how his son began his career as a car salesman, but now owns a multi-line dealership. &quot;Norm's so successful, in fact, in the last six months he gave his friend two brand new cars as a gift.&quot; 
<br /><br />The third man's son, Greg, has worked his way up through a stock brokerage, and in the last few weeks has given a good friend a large stock portfolio as a gift. 
<br /><br />As the fourth man arrives at the tee, another tells him that they have been discussing their progeny and asks what line his son is in. 
<br /><br />&quot;To tell the truth, I'm not very pleased with how my son turned out,&quot; he replies. &quot;For 15 years, Chico's been a hairdresser, and I've just recently discovered he's gay. However, on the bright side, he must be good at what he does because his last three boyfriends have given him a brand new house, two cars, and a big pile of stock certificates.&quot;

<br />A young couple decided to wed.  As the big day approached, they grew apprehensive.  Each had a problem they had never before shared with anyone, not even each other.   The Groom-to-be, overcoming his fear, decided to ask his father for advice. &quot;Father,&quot; he said, &quot;I am deeply concerned about the success of my marriage.  I love my fiancée, very much, but you see, I have very smelly feet, and I'm afraid that my future wife will be put off by them.&quot;  &quot;No problem,&quot; said dad, &quot;all you have to do is wash your feet as often as possible, and always wear socks, even to bed.&quot;  Well, to him this seemed a workable solution. 
<br />The bride-to-be, overcoming her fear, decided to take her problem up her mom.  &quot;Mom,&quot; she said, &quot;When I wake up in the 
<br />morning my breath is truly awful.&quot;  &quot;Honey,&quot; her mother consoled, &quot;everyone has bad breath in the morning.&quot;  &quot;No, you don't 
<br />understand.  My morning breath is so bad, I'm afraid  that my new husband will not want to sleep in the same room with me.&quot; 
<br />Her mother said simply, &quot;Try this.  In the morning, get straight out of bed, and head for the bathroom and brush your teeth.  The key is, not to say a word until you've brushed your teeth.  Not a word,&quot; her mother affirmed.  Well, she thought it was certainly worth a try.  The loving couple were finally married in a beautiful ceremony.  Not forgetting the advice each had received, he with his perpetual socks and she with her morning silence, they managed quite well.  That is, until about six months later.  Shortly before dawn, the husband wakes with a start to find that one of his socks had come off.  Fearful of the consequences, he frantically searches the bed.  This, of course, woke his bride and without thinking, she immediately asks, &quot;What on earth are 
<br />you doing?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no!&quot; he gasped in shock, &quot;You've swallowed my sock!&quot;

<br />At last a guy has taken the time to write this all down. Finally, the guys' side of the story. (I must admit, it's pretty good). We always hear &quot;the rules&quot; from the female point of view... Now here are the rules from the male side. These are our rules!
<br /><br />Please note... these are all numbered &quot;1&quot; ON PURPOSE!
<br /><br />1. Men ARE NOT mind readers.
<br /><br />1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.
<br /><br />1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.
<br /><br />1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.
<br /><br />1. Crying is blackmail.
<br /><br />1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!
<br /><br />1. Yes and No are perfectly Acceptable answers to almost every question.
<br /><br />1. Come to us with a problem only If you want help solving it. That's what we do.
<br />Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.
<br /><br />1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.
<br /><br />1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 Days.
<br /><br />1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.
<br /><br />1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.
<br /><br />1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.
<br /><br />1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both.
<br />If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.
<br /><br />1. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials.
<br /><br />1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.
<br /><br />1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.
<br /><br />1. If it itches, it will Be scratched. We do that.
<br /><br />1. If we ask what is wrong and you say &quot;nothing,&quot; We will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.
<br /><br />1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear.
<br /><br />1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear Is fine...Really.
<br /><br />1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or golf.
<br /><br />1. You have enough clothes.
<br /><br />1. You have too many shoes.
<br /><br />1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape!
<br /><br />1. Thank you for reading this. Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;
<br /><br />But did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping.
<br /><br />Pass this to as many men as you can - to give them a laugh.
<br />Pass this to as many women as you can - to give them a bigger laugh
<br /><br />Thanx for reading - nicked this off some guy on here cos it was so funny

<br /><br />Here are six reasons why you should think before you speak -
<br />the last one is great!
<br />Have you ever spoken and wished that you could
<br />immediately take the words back...
<br />or that you could crawl into a hole?
<br />Here are the Testimonials of a few people who did....
<br /><br />FIRST TESTIMONY:
<br />I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and asked loudly,
<br />&quot;How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?&quot;
<br />I turned around and walked back out and never went back
<br />My husband didn't say a word...
<br />he knew better.
<br /><br />SECOND TESTIMONY:
<br />I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls.
<br />I was unhappy with the women's type I had been using.
<br />After browsing for several minutes,
<br />I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at the store.
<br />He asked if he could help me.
<br />Without thinking, I looked at him and said, &quot;I think I like playing with mens balls&quot;
<br /><br />THIRD TESTIMONY:
<br />My sister and I were at the mall and
<br />passed by a store that sold a
<br />variety of candy and nuts.
<br />As we were looking at the display case,
<br />the boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help.
<br />I replied, &quot;No, I'm just looking at your nuts.&quot;
<br />My sister started to laugh hysterically.
<br />The boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away.
<br />To this day,
<br />my sister has never let me forget.
<br /><br />FOURTH TESTIMONY:
<br />While in line at the bank one afternoon,
<br />my toddler decided to release
<br />some pent-up energy and ran amok.
<br />I was finally able to grab hold of
<br />her after receiving looks of disgust
<br />and annoyance from other patrons.
<br />I told her that if she did not start behaving
<br />&quot;right now&quot; she would be punished.
<br />To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as threatening,
<br />&quot;If you don't let me go right now,
<br />I will tell Grandma that I saw you
<br />kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!&quot;
<br />The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange.
<br />Even the tellers stopped what they were doing.
<br />I mustered up the last of my dignity and
<br />walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow.
<br />The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me, were screams of laughter.
<br /><br />FIFTH TESTIMONY:
<br />Have you ever asked your child a question too many times?
<br />My three-year-old son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly.
<br />One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch, in between errands
<br />It was very busy, with a full dining room.
<br />While enjoying my taco,
<br />I smelled something funny,
<br />so of course I checked
<br />my seven-month-old daughter, she was clean.
<br />The realized that Danny
<br />had not asked to go potty in a while.
<br />I asked him if he needed to go,
<br />and he said &quot;No&quot;.
<br />I kept thinking
<br />&quot;Oh Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me.&quot;
<br />Then I said,
<br />&quot;Danny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?&quot;
<br />&quot;No,&quot; he replied.
<br />I just KNEW that he must ha ve had an accident, because the smell was getting worse.
<br />Soooooo, I asked one more time, &quot;Danny did you have an accident ? This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants,
<br />bent over, spread his cheeks
<br />and yelled
<br />&quot;SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!!&quot;
<br />While 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing,
<br />he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down.
<br />An old couple made me feel better,
<br />thanking me for the best laugh they'd ever had!
<br /><br />LAST BUT NOT LEAST TESTIMONY:
<br />This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days
<br />and a very embarrassed female news anchor who will,
<br />in the future, likely think before she speaks.
<br />What happens when you predict snow but don't get any!
<br />We had a female news anchor that,
<br />the day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn't,
<br />turned to the weatherman and asked:
<br />&quot;So Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?&quot;
<br />Not only did HE have to leave the set,
<br />but half the crew did too they were laughing so hard!
