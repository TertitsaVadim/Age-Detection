<br />When snow falls in Montana, or rain <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRib3R0b21zaG9lc3NhbGUub3JnLw__" target="_blank">red christian louboutin</a>in western New York, it cascades through America's heartland and along the Mis¬sissippi River system that drains two- fifths of the U.S. landmass. Similarly, a snowflake falling in Switzerland or a raindrop falling in northern France fol¬lows a familiar course to the Netherlands. The Mississippi River deltaic plain and the Rhine-Maas delta are the river sys¬tems' valves.
<br />These are wonderful, and dangerous, places to live, withjob-producing harbors and wetlands' unique biodiversity. But they also carry the risk of destructive floods that can cause tens of billions of dollars in damage.
<br />Sixty percent of the Netherlands is at or below sea level; two-thirds of its people live in flood-prone areas; and 70 percent of Dutch gross domestic product is pro¬duced in areas under threat of water. The cadence <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRzb2xlZHNob2VzLm9yZy51ay8_" target="_blank">red soled shoes</a>of Dutch history is marked by floods and the response to them.
<br />For me, as ambassador of the Nether¬lands, this year's Mississippi flooding is a reminder of 1993 and 1995, when our rivers swelled to unprecedented levels. Large tracts of farmland were inundated; 250,000 people were evacuated. Direct flood damages exceeded $300 million, or 0.5 percent of Dutch GDP.

But something changed in the Nether¬lands in the late 1990s. More homes and businesses than ever had been built di¬rectly &quot;behind the dikes,&quot; in subsiding land. Climate change began to produce wetter winters, leading to repeated, dan¬gerous river crests. Combined with the old Dutch adage that &quot;there are two types of levees: those that have failed, and those that will,&quot; those factors made us realize that something else needed to change.
<br />Room for the River was born.
<br />This project, implementation of which started in 2006, restores the river's natu¬ral flood plain in places where it is least harmful in order to protect those areas that need to be defended. By 2015,
<br />through a series of 35 projects costing $3 billion, we will have lowered and broadened our flood plain and created river diversions and temporary  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaHJpc3RpYW5sb3Vib3V0aW5zYWxlMjAxMi5vcmcv" target="_blank">christian louboutin shoes sale</a>water storage areas. We will restore marshy riverine landscapes to serve once again as natural &quot;water storage&quot; sponges and pro¬vide biodiversity and aesthetic and recre¬ational values.
<br />Complementing Room for the River are two corollary policies: &quot;Retain, Store, Drain&quot; and &quot;Living with Water.&quot; They encourage neighborhoods to retain water where it falls, using cisterns, green roofs and floodable parks. Living With Water demands that urban planners and water managers create communities wherein water is a cherished asset and not some¬thing to fear and keep out of sight.

That's the irony of it.&quot; Marius Deeb, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, believes <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcGNocmlzdGlhbmxvdWJvdXRpbnNob2VzZXMub3JnLw__" target="_blank">louboutin shoes cheap</a> that countries such as Bahrain have little choice but to continue to pursue a cultural policy that links them to the international world and the West. The Gulf States' pursuit of high-profile cultural events isn't superficial image-building but a genuine defense against Iranian government influence, which would drag &quot;them backwards to the middle Ages,&quot; he says. But others question the goals and accomplishment of the trophy-culture strategy. Azar Nafisi, author of &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot; and a visiting fellow at SAIS, says that Western cultural leaders need to think more deeply about the essential purpose and ethical seriousness of art when engaging with authoritarian regimes. &quot;There is a spirit of art and literature, a spirit of subversive- ness,&quot; she says, which is easily compromised during collaboration with no democratic countries. When the political climate is sensitive, she says, art easily becomes &quot;decorative&quot; and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXNjb3VudGNocmlzdGlhbmxvdWJvdXRpbnNob2VzZXMub3JnLw__" target="_blank">louboutin shoes discount</a> loses meaning and power. Sheikh Mai sees no choice but to go forward in the same way she always has. Real Bahraini artists, she says, are loyal to the government. And although Bahrain may be isolated from the international community at the moment, it can always look to its neighbors in the gulf, including Saudi Arabia, which currently has troops in Bahrain to enforce martial law.

So on June 3, their lawyer showed up at a branch office in Naples, Fla., with a moving truck and sheriff's deputies who had a judge's permission to seize the furniture if necessary. An hour later, the bank had written a check for $5,772.88. &quot;The branch manager was visibly shaken,&quot; Todd Allen said Monday, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRzb2xlZHNob2VzLnVzLw__" target="_blank">red sole shoes</a> recalling the visit to the bank last week. &quot;At that point I was willing to take the desk and the chair he was sitting in.&quot;&quot;Lo and behold, we got two offers,&quot; Margolis said. &quot;But they were tire kickers, to be honest. Both buyers would not go up in price.&quot; In December, Margolis advised the owners to pull the house off the market and set their sights on spring. In March, the home was relisted. Within two weeks they received three offers, and two were above asking price.
<br />The home sold for $754,000 in March. Second- and third-place teams each won $500. The winning team was the &quot;Cheesy Burghers.&quot; The extra &quot;h&quot; is a nod to the fact that some of them hail from Pittsburgh and attended Carnegie Mellon University. Sean Vera, Diana Vera, Alexis Elliott, Kevin Chang, James Auwaerter, Amy Poster and Galen Mullins excitedly stepped onstage and accepted their hard-earned oversize white-and-orange check. Deaths, complication and errors rise at night and on weekends. Hospitals are turning to 'nocturnes' for help. After the moving company and sheriff's deputies get their share, the Nyergeses were expected to receive their share of the money this week, ending a bizarre saga that started when they paid Bank of America $165,000 cash for a 2,700-square-foot house that was foreclosed on in Naples in 2009.
<br />About four months later, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZWRzb2xlZHNob2VzLnVzL3JlZC1zb2xlZC1ib290cy8_" target="_blank">red soled boots</a> a process server knocked on their door and handed Warren Merges a notice of foreclosure. &quot;This is a big mistake,&quot; he recalled saying. &quot;You must have the wrong house. We bought a foreclosure and don't have a mortgage.&quot; Whenever Merges called the bank, representatives told him to &quot;come up to date&quot; with his payments. When he called 25 different law firms, no lawyer would take the case. When he went to court, the lawyers for the bank filed incorrect motions and were woefully unprepared for the hearings. &quot;It was mind boggling,&quot; said Merges, a 46-year-old retired police officer. &quot;To try to unscrew the screw up, it's not as easy as it sounds.&quot; Eventually the Nyergeses found Allen. They fought the foreclosure and won, proving that they owned the home outright.

There's less nursing care, less access to a doctor and more demands on doctors,&quot; added Grumman, a veteran of more than 35 years of hospitalizations to treat cancer-related illnesses. To bridge the chasm between the day and night shifts, hospitals from Syracuse to Seattle are hiring a new breed of subspecialist called a &quot;nocturnes&quot; — an experienced doctor who works overnight taking care of patients outside the emergency room. During his research, Merges heard that his name got transposed from purchase agreements onto the prior foreclosure. &quot;I don't know if that is a fact, because no one really had the facts,&quot; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZW5pbS1qZWFucy5vcmcudWsv" target="_blank">denim jeans</a> he said. In September 2010, a Collier County judge ordered Bank of America to pay the couple's $2,534 attorney fees. But by last week, the bank hadn't paid up, so Allen got a judge's permission to seize assets. In an e-mail to the Associated Press on Monday, Bank of America spokeswoman Jumana Bowens apologized to the couple about the &quot;delay in receiving the funds.&quot;
<br />&quot;The original request went to an outside attorney who is no longer in business,&quot; she wrote. The law office of David J. Stern, which handled the Nyergeses' case for Bank of America, told judges across Florida in March that it will end its involvement in 100,000 foreclosure cases. The Florida attorney general's economic crimes division is investigating three law firms, including Stern's, over allegations that they created fraudulent legal documents, gouged homeowners with inflated fees, steered business to companies they owned and filed foreclosures without proving the bank actually had legal interest in the loans. According to employee testimony filed with Florida authorities, Stern's employees churned out bogus mortgage assignments, faked signatures, falsified notarizations and foreclosed on people without verifying their identities, the amounts they owed or who owned their loans.
