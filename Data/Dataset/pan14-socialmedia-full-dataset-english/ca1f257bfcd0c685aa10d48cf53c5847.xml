An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. So be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path. The power of words… it is sometimes hard to understand that an encouraging word can go such a long way.

<br /><br />Today the time elapsed too fast. I can’t clung the time. sometimes I think the time isn’t enough for me to do. I’m hurry up! I’m try to finish it but I can’t
<br /><br />I watch some video in the Internet which tell about the lifetime. they tell that don’t waste your time. please do everything if you can and never give up the game. I know it’s hard for you but if we try our best, we are the winners.  nothing is can if we say I can. Just an speech can change your thinking and activing. you have waste your time, your fortunes, your health to do bad deeds, useless… .
<br /><br />I don’t know why I’m concerned with this matter but I ought to remind myself that I should live more useful. This semester I have some times to do unprofit things. I forgot something and I don’t study well. 
<br /><br />I like to do many things. have a girl friend same as my friends, learn chinese, learn how to play guitar, learn how to draw well….. . so what things is necessary for me for the furture? or all of them are really need for me? I haven’t got any answer. But………..now, I had.
<br /><br />somebody think that I’m a foolish person. Yes, I’m not handsome, not rich, not intelligent but I have the will. I haven’t any girl friend but I have many fiend is girl. I don’t fall in love but another one love me. I haven’t got any  individual love but I have got much love for country, for the poor, for the hard situation persons. I want to contribute some things to them. But now, I can’t, I can’t. my ability isn’t enough to do that hard job. I need the time, I need to make perfect myself and then, do those.
<br /><br />That’s happy when I still talk  English with my friend. althought he is far away but I like it. He stay just an week in Vietnam but I had many memorises with him. He present me 2 gilfs. those are an novel and an dictionary. i like it so much!
<br /><br />Today is Friday, on 03-05-2012 ,  approach to examination and camping in anniversary 15 years established my school. So I have many thingsto do!
<br /><br />have a nice week!

<br /><br />I has 3 good friend and we has the same interesting. that's English. I like English, I like to become a tour gide, I like go abroad. This is my wishes. I will do it, I will do it.
<br /><br />the truth is this semester I study hard, I has many Subject to learn and the outdoor activities is so much, It reason why I can't earn English more. That cause of why I can't improve more.
<br />I wish I have  a friend who can talk english with me when I have free time.

<br />and the best things in dalat is the weather. there are 4 season in Dalat, and i had met old clasmates, we chat together and i feel so fun. they are THIEN and MIEN, who is studying DA LAT university.
<br />after that, we visit Nha Trang city where famous about the beach and tourism. Many, many foreiner is Nha Trang and enjoy the asmosphere from sea. 
<br />nha trang famous about the beach and shopping, some even was  ognized in Nha Trang same as MISS WORD COMPETITION  and so on. i had visit Tri Nguyen lake which was build same as the old trip. that place breeding many kind of fish from every where in The word. but the surface is not large.
<br /> the last day, we returned Tamky fom Nha Trang like and finished my trip around 5pm. Then, i return my familly and come to my house at 6.00 pm
