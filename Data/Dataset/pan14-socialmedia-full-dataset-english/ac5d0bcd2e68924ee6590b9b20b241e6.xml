<br /><br />Is She Too Vocal?
<br /><br />Typically, the women who fake orgasm tend to be very vocal (obviously borrowed from the climatic scenes of adult movies). If she’s screaming, moaning, in a tone where it doesn’t sound like her voice is shaking…or…if she’s saying things that sound “clear” (for example: “Oh My God!” vs. “Ooh-oohh m-m-m-y-y-…oo…g-g-g..od..!”), then that’s a sign she’s faking.
<br /><br />Contractions and Other Physical Signs
<br /><br />During orgasms, a woman vagina and anus will contract. During a real orgasm, the vagina will contract strongly at about 1 contraction every 0.8 seconds. A woman can mimic a strong vaginal contraction, but to do it at that pace is very difficult.
<br /><br />Other signs she’s faking:
<br />• She doesn’t have the “Sex Flush” (reddish skin)
<br />• Her anus isn’t contracting
<br />• Pupil size hasn’t dilated
<br /><br />The chances of her faking the full body spasms, vaginal contractions, shaking voice, reddish sex flush, along with the sweating, vaginal lubrication and other physical indicators are slim to none.

<br />2. Women sometimes wish they were more casual about things like sex, threesomes, and stripping but without the emotional consequences.
<br />3. If a man tells a woman that he never wants kids, he’s just taken himself out of the running for a future with most women.
<br />4. Women want you to always take care of your physical self. Even if they say they love you no matter what, they don’t mean that it’s ok to “let yourself go.”
<br />5. Ladies often have fantasies playing in their heads while they are in bed with you. This is not to say that you aren’t a good lover, but that they use those images to heighten their sexual experience.
<br />6. Women secretly like it when their man becomes jealous over another male’s attention (as long as it isn’t obsessive and controlling!) and may even fuel the fires of jealousy just to feel desired and wanted by their guy.
<br />7. While women may be supportive of a certain amount of masculine flaws, there’s a line already drawn in their heads which you might not recognize until you’ve crossed it and it’s too late
<br />8. A woman will talk about you to her friends. Often. This will include the good, the bad, and even the ugly. You’ll just have to live with the fact that her friends may know you better than you know them.
<br />9. The amount of random hair grooming/plucking/waxing she does on a regular basis may disconcert you. No matter how much grooming/hair plucking/waxing you may do, she probably feels you could do more. 
<br />Every woman possess aleast one of these triats

Gone through this ill-fated harm, Like the burnt woods in the farm, As if it was in their daily plan, But then lies roasted from the jam.Imagine the times of their departure As they walk into the ill-fated coffin, To migrate from the homely resident shores Farewells and smiles were hands and faces, Waving as they fly to seek western places, Then the ugly scene claimed their faces.What caused it and from whose authority? That was supposed to be their security. Who would have stood to sight this stains? As efforts were made but all in vain, But then, all had been eaten by the flames, Leaving us with a constant rain of pain, As we watch roasted bodies as the remains.My cries for the victims and their misfortune All lost on the quest for pleasures and fortunes. My cries for their families now painfully insane, All married to an ugly hollow piecing pain. I shed the tears of our heart broken nation, For gone are our likes the children of the nation.I cease to watch the pictures of this gloom That keeps me wakeful in tears in my room. The pretty faces which to us are dear, Now no more, and it’s hard to bear. But one thing makes me not to ponder, Even when all day long I still wonder, That the almighty God will grant them rest in his arms And give us strength to bear the loss and the harm. May their gentle soul rest in perfect peace.
