<br /><br />Before <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">British tea</a></strong>importing was a century old, by 1769, annual imports reached 4.5 million tons--and paying for the tea was creating a major drain on the crown's currency reserves. China, with plenty of cotton textiles, did not need broadcloth, the main product Britain had available for export earnings. The monetary drain worried even the Swedish botanist Linnaeus, who proposed to &quot;shut the gate through which all the silver was leaving <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Europe</a></strong>&quot; by growing tea commercially on that continent.
<br /><br />By 1800, the opium trade was providing Britain with the answer to her problem. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Opium</a></strong> had long been taken in China, but mainly in Sichuan where it grew. Smoking, introduced with tobacco around 1620, made the drug easy to use. Demand rose and Portugese merchants, followed by British, added to the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese stocks</a></strong>. Easy access to opium spurred by its dealers' profit motive caused a runaway spiral of addiction. This poisoning of a nation was rationalized by the claim that it helped the Indian colony generate its own revenue. Indian-grown opium was sold to China for silver, which remained in Canton and was credited against debts in London. Thus, without moving any bullion around, British merchants were able to get silver for opium and then turn and pay for tea with the same silver. The havoc wrought by the rapid growth of addiction aroused the concern of the Qing dynasty government.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">China forbade</a></strong>the importation of opium in 1800, on the severest penalties, but the drug kept pouring in illegally, without the import duties the government collected when the trade was legal. Opium was no longer brought to the Canton anchorage, but to an island in the middle of the bay, where it waited on ships till collected by Chinese smugglers, who were allowed in by corrupt Chinese officials bribed by the British.
<br /><br />In June 1839, the official sent to end opium importation, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwODAwOTczMy5odG1s" target="_blank">Lin Zexu</a></strong>, burned twenty thousand chests of it on the beach near Canton. Within a year Britain had declared war on China, forcing the nation to legalize the opium trade again. A decade after the end of the Second Opium War of 1857 to 1860, the number of addicts had grown tenfold and imports reached a hundred thousand chests a year. The evil &quot;foreign mud,&quot; as it was called, remained a legitimate item of commerce until 1908, and addiction persisted for decades after.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_5839443_49761445.jpg" />
<br /><br />These rules, combining the best of<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">East and West</a></strong>, are in general applicable to all kinds of tea--<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">green</a></strong>, black, or <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">oolong</a></strong>.
<br /><br />1.Use <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">fresh cold water</a></strong>. Let the cold tap run for awhile first to avoid  flat-tasting water (and also to avoid lead that may have dissolved  into it while standing in the pipe). For this same reason, never make tea with water from the hot tap. (For more on water, see below.)
<br /><br />2.While the water is heating, get the tea things ready. A small pot is preferable to a large one, as the amount of boiling water used in a  large one may &quot;stew&quot; the leaves and result in flat-tasting tea. Warm the pot (of pottery or other ceramic material) by rinsing it with hot water. If you wish, you can measure the rinse water in by cupfuls, so you will know just how far up to fill the pot when you actually make the tea. (This gauging won't be necessary after you become familiar with your teapot.)
<br /><br />3.Just before the water in the kettle boils, empty the teapot and add tea. For each cup use one teaspoonful of tea or one tea bag. For more than six cups, add an extra spoon &quot;for the pot.&quot; If tea bags are used, they should be placed on the bottom of the pot so the water can hit them with full force.
<br /><br />Some people use a perforated metal infuser or tea ball in a pot or mug, but connoisseurs frown on this, maintaining that the infuser  prevents the water from fully saturating the leaves (this is also the criticism of tea bags, but their convenience may win out). If an infuser is used, it should be no more than half full of leaves to allow room for them to expand.
<br /><br />4.Some people prefer water at a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">rolling boil</a></strong>. The air bubbles in it help spread out the tea leaves so that the water can get to them better. Others prefer it just before the full boil, when bubbles begin to rise, particularly for green tea. British wisdom teaches: &quot;Fake the teapot to the water kettle, never the other way round--this applies to black tea, not green tea, which does not require as much heat.
<br /><br />An optional step before adding boiling water to tea is called &quot;rinsing the tea leaves.&quot; It is mandatory in making gongfu tea, but can improve any type except broken black tea. (Rinsing releases the compounds in the broken tea too rapidly, harming the flavor.) After the tea leaves have been added to the pot, pour in a little boiling  water and drain it off immediately.
<br /><br />5.Finally, pour boiling water into the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">pot</a></strong> to the desired level and cover. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">British style</a></strong>is to keep the pot warm with a padded tea cosy, but the Chinese avoid this practice, feeling that it causes the leaves to stew, making them bitter and putting the chemical elements out  of balance.
<br /><br />If high-grade green tea is used, authorities from the Chinese Agricultural Institute advise leaving the lid off the pot, for these teas are easily stewed.
<br /><br />6.Let the tea stand. The best tea is made by infusing for a short time  rather than steeping for a longer period. Three to five minutes is recommended, with the shorter time preferred. A kitchen timer is handy for this. Curled leaves take longer than flat ones and probably will need the full five minutes. Three is enough for most other teas. Very fine tea needs an extremely short time.
<br /><br />Do not infuse any tea longer than five minutes, or it will become  bitter. A longer time is not necessary, as the flavor and the tannin come out early in the infusion. A shorter time also reduces the caffeine. About three-fourths of the caffeine comes out in a five minute infusion. Make time and not color your gauge of when the tea is ready, because color is not a good gauge of flavor. If you want stronger tea, use more leaves, not more time. The color comes out very quickly in black tea. Green tea should never get dark.
<br /><br />7.<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTY0NDAwOTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Rinse cups</a></strong>with hot water. If you use milk with black tea, now is the time to pour it into the cup. British tea drinkers swear by this. &quot;Scalding&quot; the milk with the hot tea gives it a particular desired flavor, they say. Another less poetic reason for putting milk in first is offered by none other than Samuel H. G. Twining, ninth generation of the family whose company supplies tea to the British crown: milk keeps the hot tea from cracking delicate porcelain cups. Never use cream. The tannin causes cream to curdle. Milk is never used with green tea, but sometimes with oolong.
<br /><br />8.Before pouring, stir the tea or shake the pot and then let the leaves settle. Pour into cups through a tea strainer. Green tea is of course  taken without anything in it. If lemon and sugar are used with black tea, put the sugar in first, so it can dissolve well.
<br /><br />9.Strain off any tea left in the pot into another warmed pot, and cover with the tea cosy. Don't let the tea stand with the leaves in longer to make it darker.
<br /><br />10.The second infusion. Opinions differ on this according to the kind of tea and the authority. Many people say the second infusion is the best. In China, green tea drinkers start the day with some leaves in the bottom of their covered mugs and keep adding water before the  cup is completely empty. Black and oolong teas can stand up through more infusions than green tea.
<br /><br />11.Never use tea that has stood overnight. Researchers at the Fujian province Chinese Medicine Research Institute found that while fresh green and oolong tea lowered incidence of lung cancer in rabbits, green tea that had stood overnight increased it.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_9492640_49975743.jpg" />
<br /><br />In the beginning, utensils used in<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">tea</a></strong>service were imported from China. They included <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">bronze flower</a></strong>containers and <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">vessels</a> </strong>for water to wash the bowls, iron teakettles, ceramic tea caddies, and celadon or white porcelain bowls. In the mid-1300s the shoguns started collecting these as art objects and displayed them ostentatiously. They became increasingly valuable, and much of the etiquette in the tea ceremony developed out of delicate ways to handle them. This trend was to change within a few centuries as a new viewpoint developed which was to have a lasting effect on Japanese art.
<br /><br />This new view, wabi, has been variously defined as quiet simplicity, finding satisfaction in poverty, love of solitude. It emphasized the artistic value of unadorned, natural, and even unattractive objects.
<br /><br />Following tradmonal Buddhist ideas, imperfect objects, whether natural or crafted, and those lackin ornamentation, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">evoke deer</a></strong>, morespirltual feelings. This view recognizes the intrinsically beautiful characteristics in imperfection, thus giving the viewer a more active role in appreciating that beauty, and thereby creating a more spiritual experience
<br /><br />The roots of wabi lie in the love of the simple, solitary, hermit-like life  that is part of Buddhism and also Taoism, another religious influence in Japan. The wabi view began to surface in the utterances of the monk <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Murata Shuko</a>(</strong>orJuko, 1521-1591). Shuko was threatened with expulsion from the temple for continually falling asleep during daytime meditation, so the story goes. He went to a doctor, who prescribed tea. Shuko grew so fond o fit that he served it to everybody with considerable ceremony.
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">shogun Yoshimasa</a></strong>heard about it and invited Shuko to create a tea ceremony for him. Shuko thus became known as the first tea master and founder of the tea ceremony, though Japanese authorities cannot agree as to whether a kind of secular tea ceremony existed before him. In Shuko's time tea drinking became so popular among the common people that tea stands appeared along the highways.
<br /><br />Tea drinking among the samurai was often accompanied by viewing of the full moon from a second-story balcony of a garden tea pavilion. To  Shuko is attributed the comment, &quot;I have no taste for the full moon.&quot; This is taken variously to mean a criticism of the lavish tea gatherings, and indirectly of the almost total use of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese tea</a></strong>things, for Shuko is also quoted on the beauty of Japanese ones. Another meaning of the quote is that he preferred the asymmetrical beauty of a moon partly covered by clouds, or what has been called &quot;the worship of the imperfect.&quot;
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1MTAwOTc1Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Shuko</a></strong> replaced Chinese landscape paintings with calligraphy of Zen mottoes. He also believed that the proper quiet could not be achieved in a room in a larger building and that tea should be served in a small hut, but it remained for his pupil Soju to realize this ideal.
<br /><br />Another big step in this direction was taken by Jo-o (1502-1555), an official of the lower ranks, after he became a tea master. He maintained that peace of mind could never be attained in the tearoom of his day, which was a reception room in a larger building. He built an isolated tea hut like a peasant home, and used vessels of common Japanese-made pottery. He is considered originator of the wabi tea ceremony.

<br /><br />The name Jiuqu means Nine-Bend Stream, a main area of this tea's production near Mt. Dawu in Zhejiang province. The mountain faces the wide <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYwNjAwOTgyOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Qiantang River</a></strong>, famous for its tidal bore, so plenty of ocean moisture is drawn up to the tea gardens. Hongmei from the Nine-Bend area is ranked as first grade, with that from other parts of Zhejiang second and third.
<br /><br />When thunder rolls over <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYwNjAwOTgyOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Nine-Bend Stream</a></strong>, the people tell this story to their children: A couple living by a stream had a child late in life. They treasured the fine, strong boy above all else. One day while playing at the brook he found a beautiful black pearl. He put it in his mouth to keep it safe and ran home to show his parents, but on the way he tripped over a stone and swallowed the pearl.
<br /><br />Soon he was rolling on the ground with severe stomach pain. Suddenly a violent thunderstorm came up. The boy changed into a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYwNjAwOTgyOS5odG1s" target="_blank">black dragon</a></strong>and flew up into the sky, where he remained a long time riding the clouds and rain, reluctant to leave his parents. From time to time he would turn and look back at them. He made altogether nine turns. When he was gone, there remained a stream with nine bends.
<br /><br />That is why this tea is sometimes calledJiuqu Wnlong (Black Dragon). It is a fully-fermented gong/:u black tea, but because of this name it is sometimes confused with the semi-fermented oolong (wulong).

It is marketed in bulk as<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Pu-erh</a></strong>, shaped into cakes as Pu'er Cake Tea and into the bowl-shaped cakes called <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Yunnan Tuo Cha</a></strong>.

Located in central south<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Yunnan</a></strong>, Pu'er county itself does not grow tea, but the name it has given to this variety has become internationally known.
<br /><br />Pu-erh is often taken for relief of indigestion and diarrhea. Modern medical tests indicate its effectiveness in reducing cholesterol (see p. 105). <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Pu-erh</a></strong>is customarily kept for a long time, and in Asian tradition leaves with a light coating of mold are considered the best and to have the greatest medicinal effect. However, tests in two universities and a medical center in Japan showed no significant difference between two and twenty-year-old Pu-erh in reducing cholesterol.
<br /><br />Pu-erh is viewed as a mild tea, suitable for young and old, and for persons with strong or weak constitutions. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Yunnan Tuo Cha</a></strong>, a form of Pu-erh, received the Ninth International Food Award at a conference in Barcelona, Spain, in 1986.
<br /><br />Pu-erh is very special because of a unique combination of factors. It is an unusual large-leafed variety, it enjoys special growing conditions with the combination of climate and soil in the Yunnan mountains, and it is semi-fermented, but for a longer time than oolong.
<br /><br />The taste has been described as mellow, however those not accustomed to it might not enjoy the &quot;old&quot;--perhaps &quot;elemental&quot; or &quot;earthy&quot; are better words--taste, particularly in the first infusion. For others, however, this flavor will add to its aura of wonder, and seem fitting in a tea prized for its medicinal properties. Some people recommend first getting used to Nuoshan Pu'er, which has less of this taste. Or Pu-erh may be mixed with a little <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Yinzhen</a></strong> (a cheaper type than on p. 144) to cut the &quot;old&quot; flavor and create an unexpected new one. Pu-erh is known for maintaining flavor through multiple infusions.
<br /><br />A combination of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Pu-erh</a></strong> and Chrysanthemum tea (made from the small pale yellow blossoms of that piano is considered particularly good for cooling internal heat, and is also delicious. Called Gupu cha, it can be requested in Cantonese teahouses as <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNDAwOTgzOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Gook Po cha</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Another famous Cantonese specialty is Pu-Show (Pu-erh and Show Mee). The latter, a white tea, is classified as &quot;cool&quot; by traditional pharmacology, and is sometimes neutralized with a combination that also yields a new flavor.
<br /><br />Pu-erh tea is sold loose (of these, Nuoshan from the mountain of the same name is the best known), or in pressed form named for the shape ,in which a block is molded. These include:
<br /><br />Tuocha, bowl tea, shaped by pressing into a bowl.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_5839443_49761445.jpg" />
<br /><br />This is the most famous of all <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese oolongs</a></strong>. Guanyin, sometimes called the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Goddess of Mercy</a></strong>, is actually more like the Buddhist equivalent of the Madonna. She is a bodhisattva, one who is qualified to enter nirvana, but chose to remain on earth to bring all to enlightenment. Statues of her stand in many <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Buddhist temples</a></strong>, and a woman who wants a child may pray to her. A legend gives one version of why a tea bears her name.
<br /><br />An iron statue of Guanyin stood in a rundown temple in central Fujian's Shaxian (Sand county). The temple's condition aroused the concern of a tea grower who passed it daily. Financially unable to repair it, he thought that the least he could do was to burn incense and clean the place twice a month.
<br /><br />One night <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Guanyin</a></strong> appeared to him in a dream and told him to look in the cave behind the temple for a treasure. He was to take it for himself but also to share it with others. There he found a single tea shoot which he planted and cultivated into a bush with leaves that produced a singularly fine drink. He began selling it under the Guanyin name, and gave many cuttings to his neighbors. All prospered, and eventually the temple was repaired.
<br /><br />A book from contemporary China gives another version: this tea is so named for the appearance of its processed leaves--dark as iron and heavier than other teas, but with a quality as pure and beautiful as <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Guanyin</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Tieguanyin is also the name of a tea strain. The short, spreading shrub has glossy, dark green leaves, soft and fat with curling serrated edges. The tightly twisted, shiny dark green leaves produce an aromatic brownish-orange liquor of high astringency. These leaves can be used through many more infusions than most varieties.
<br /><br />This is the tea that the people of Chaozhou on the Guangdong province coast like to brew <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxNjAwOTg0MC5odG1s" target="_blank">gongCu</a></strong> style in tiny pottery teapots and sip from thimble-sized cups, the better to savor its orchidlike flavor and long-lasting aftertaste.
<br /><br />A related oolong also made in Fujian and exported is Ti Lohan (Tielohan, Iron Arhat, a monk who has put aside all the passions of the world). It comes from Hui'an, and is particularly famous in the Philip- pines.

<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxOTAwOTg0My5odG1s" target="_blank">Lichee Black (Lizhi Hongcha), Fruit-Flavored</a></strong>
<br />A black tea treated with the juice of the lichee produces a delightful beverage. The fresh, juicy lichee is one of south China's famous fruits.
<br /><br />For smoothness and color its flesh is often likened to white jade. The sweet-tart taste, color, and juiciness oflichees remind some Westerners of grapefruit, although the two fruits are not related. In the present Chinese spelling they are lizhi. (Alternative spellings seen in the West include litchee and lychee.) Guangdong province is a big producer of lichees and Lichee Black tea.
<br /><br />The Chinese people often recall a bit of their history in connection with lichees. Theywere a favorite of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTYxOTAwOTg0My5odG1s" target="_blank">LadyYangYuhuan</a></strong>, considered one of the four most beautiful women in Chinese history. She was the beloved of Tang dynasty Emperor Xuan Zong (also known as Ming Huang, r. 712-756). By aying too much attention to her (she is also known as Yang Guifei, Honored Concubine Yang) and not enough to state affairs, he lost his throne.
<br /><br />He would do anything to make her happy. Lichees are an extremely perishable fruit, so the emperor arranged to have them brought to his apital Xi'an from the south by night and day relay riders. To this day the fruit is also known by the name Feizi Xiao (Feizi's Smile).

It has the flavor of orchids, although it is not strictly a scented tea. Or, rather, the leaves as they open are naturally scented by the myriad of wild <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTU1MDAwOTgxOS5odG1s" target="_blank">cymbidium</a></strong> orchids that blossom all over the mountains just at that time. During infusion, the dark green leaves unfurl like colorful floating flowers, with a reddish center vein and pink side veins. To ensure that the leaves create this beautiful picture, sorting standards are extemely high, and all abnormal, incomplete, or discolored leaf sets are picked out by hand.
<br /><br />Its name, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTU1MDAwOTgxOS5odG1s" target="_blank">Taiping Houkui</a></strong>(Houkeng Leader), comes from a place in Taiping county. Since its gold medal in the first rank at the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition it has become world famous.
<br /><br />The leaves are processed through de-enzymizing by heat-drying, which takes a great deal of expertise. The processed leaves are straight, taut, and heavy, and pointed at both ends. They are noted for their ability to stand up through several infusions.

Rain half the year and mist and clouds the rest, along with the shade of the northern slopes, provide ideal conditions for tender tea leaves.
<br /><br />As for the orchids, the higher the slope, the better they grow. Experiments have even shown that the presence of the orchid flavor in the teas from orchid regions is in direct ratio to the altitude of the plantations.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_40821_49769928.jpg" />
<br /><br />In this chapter we offer choice of a<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTUxNTAwOTgwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">fifty teas</a></strong>to drink for your pleasure and health. Most are extremely well known in <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTUxNTAwOTgwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">China</a></strong>. Many are not available for sale in the United States at present, and for others there is no reliable supply. However, visitors to <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTUxNTAwOTgwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">China</a></strong>, particularly if they are near the area of production, are quite likely to encounter some of these teas, which may become more widely available in the future. The ones we have chosen are very famous, or have a colorful history or lore, an interesting process, or are otherwise distinguished. Many other teas are mentioned in passing.
<br /><br /><strong>A NOTE ON NAMES</strong>
<br /><br />We have listed teas both by their <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTUxNTAwOTgwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese characters</a></strong>and by the names under which they are commmonly sold on the international market, rather than in strict conformity with the present-day Chinese pinyin romanization  system of spelling. When we have no evidence of the market name of a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA2MTUxNTAwOTgwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">tea</a></strong>, we have used pinyin. So the spelling system of the names will necessarily appear inconsistent. Tea terms originated in many ways: from several languages, from commercial usage at various times, and from numerous authorities, so it is not surprising that there should be variations.

<br /><br />However, the polyphenols in tea also bind with milk protein. There-fore, does putting milk into black tea cut down the effects of its <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYyMjAwOTc3NC5odG1s" target="_blank">polyphenols</a></strong>? Not substantially, says <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYyMjAwOTc3NC5odG1s" target="_blank">Professor Chi-tang Ho</a></strong>of Rutgers University, who has done considerable research on tea chemistry. Even in black tea, which has been fermented, about 30 percent of the polyphenols remain unoxydized, and the milk combines first with the 70 percent of oxidized polyphenols, and the chief effect is to ease their harshness to your stomach. So if you prefer the taste of black tea, milk is probably a good thing. However, if you put in too much milk, when it has finished with the oxydized polyphenols, it will go on to the unoxydized ones.
<br /><br />Neither sugar nor lemon juice had until recently been thought to have any effect on the chemistry of tea. However, researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that adding the enzyme tannase, or lemon juice, to <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYyMjAwOTc3NC5odG1s" target="_blank">black tea</a></strong>increased iron and calcium solubility, and therefore absorption by the body. The polyphenols can bind with iron and calcium, preventing these minerals from being absorbed, but lemon juice inhibits this binding, keeping the minerals available.
<br /><br />In the 1950s it was learned that when lemon tea was served in styrofoam containers the polystyrene dissolved into the beverage. It should never be served in these containers.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_40821_49769928.jpg" />
<br /><br />The news gets better as we go along. Not only is tea lower in<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzMTAwOTc4MC5odG1s" target="_blank">caffeine</a></strong>,but now it's been found that <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzMTAwOTc4MC5odG1s" target="_blank">caffeine</a> </strong>in moderation is not dangerous.
<br /><br />Numerous studies of<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzMTAwOTc4MC5odG1s" target="_blank">caffein</a></strong>e have been made in the United States over the past decade. Most were concerned with coffee, but black tea, as an alternative beverage, has been involved by implication. Some early studies linked caffeine to pancreatic cancer and heart disease, but further recent research does not bear this out. In fact, so far no one has been able to prove any direct relationship between serious illness and beverage caffeine in moderate amounts.
<br /><br />Tests have been unable to pinpoint such a relationship because many other factors must be considered (smoking, stress, lifestyle, diet, etc.). A broad study made in Norway originally stated that heavy coffee drinkers had higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, but a second look showed that many of the subjects smoked, had a high fat consumption, and took insufficient exercise. &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzMTAwOTc4MC5odG1s" target="_blank">Coffee drinking</a></strong>may therefore indicate an unhealthy lifestyle,&quot; was the conclusion as reported in the University of California's prestigious U.C. Berkeley l/Veilhess Newsletter (July 1988).
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzMTAwOTc4MC5odG1s" target="_blank">caffeine</a> </strong>in coffee or tea drunk in moderation should not harm a healthy person, says the newsletter, or even give rise to the jitters known as coffee nerves. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are urged, however, not to exceed moderation levels, and persons with irregular heartbeats might be better off with no caffeine-containing beverages. Moderation is defined as 200 to 250 milligrams per day, about the equivalent of the caffeine in two cups of coffee. In that case, drinkers of tea, with its lower caffeine content, should have no problem. Physicians have long prescribed caffeine in medicines. Studies are now putting less emphasis on caffeine as a danger and more on its uses to benefit health.
<br /><br />Caffeine stimulates movement of the intestinal tract and increases the flow of digestive juices. This could be one reason why a cup of tea after a greasy meal helps dissipate the fat and alleviates the feeling of discomfort.

<br /><br />Long ago in <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzODAwOTc4Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">China</a></strong>, tea was an ingredient in immortality potions favored by the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzODAwOTc4Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">Taoists</a>,</strong> who were keen on that subject. Still today, perhaps as an echo of those beliefs, claims are made that tea drinking helps one to live to a ripe old age. While it is no magic fountain of youth, some of its benefits can be said to contribute to longevity (stimulation of bodily functions, strengthening the immune system, reducing the chance of heart disease and improving stomach functions). The<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzODAwOTc4Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">fluoride in tea</a></strong>can strengthen bones and help ward off osteoporosis in the same way that it strengthens dental enamel. Investigation into whether tea has any further effect on longevity and, if so, why, is only just beginning.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzODAwOTc4Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese researchers</a> </strong>found that 1 percent jasmine tea extended the life of fruit flies to 40.5 days, more than double that of the control group, which drank plain water and had a life span of 16.5 days. On a 5 percent solution they lived 28.6 days. Oolong tea, in other tests, doubled the lifespan. (Monographs by the Fujian Institute of Traditional Medicine, Fuzhou, circulated by the Tea Branch of the Fujian provincial import/ export corporation.)
<br /><br />Thus far, it is not understood what compounds in <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzODAwOTc4Ny5odG1s" target="_blank">tea</a></strong> could have this effect on insects, and it would obviously require much additional research to determine whether such reported effects of tea on the span of insects' lives could be duplicated in an entirely different species.

Lu Yu said spring water was best, followed by river water, and then well water. The amount of minerals in the water seems to have been a consideration. The problem is that nowadays it's practically impossible to find such &quot;natural&quot; water that is unpolluted, and tap water is frequently highly chlorinated. Various types of bottled spring water, now available everywhere, can yield satisfactory results. We recommend experimenting to find the best water.

<br /><br />The Chinese tried by every means to keep secret the methods of <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">tea cultivation</a></strong> and processing, as they had earlier the technology of silk production. Imperial edicts prohibited revealing them on the pain of death. False information about tea production was even passed around to confuse outsiders. For three centuries China was successful hiding the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">mysteries of tea</a></strong>, and was the world's main tea exporter.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Linnaeus</a></strong> was eager to have a tea plant. His student, Per Osbek, transported one to the Cape of Good Hope on a Swedish East India Company vessel, but it was lost in a storm. Another fell into the harbor when the ship's guns fired a departing salute. He did get a plant to Uppsala in Sweden and nourished it with great care until it was found to be an ordinary camelia. A true tea plant that reached Sweden in 1763 was eaten by rats. Finally a Swedish ship brought some potted seeds, which germinated and grew. But even then, Linnaeus did not know the secret of processing, and assumed that green tea and black tea were two different species.
<br /><br />In 1793 the embassy to China led by<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">Lord Macarmey</a></strong>obtained some tea seeds which they took to Calcutta. The next few decades saw several attempts to grow tea outside China from seeds. Dutch growers were successful in Java with both seeds and plants from Japan.
<br /><br />The <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">British East India Company[/</a>b] had been uneasy about its total dependence on China for tea long before the Opium War, and from 1788 on had entertained the possibility of growing tea in India. In the early 1830s its Tea Committee circulated a questionnaire to all company employees inquiring about locations with suitable climate and altitude.
<br /><br />In 1823 Major Robert Bruce had actually discovered an indigenous tea used by native people in India's Assam while living with them after the conquest of this remote area. His brother Charles sent specimen branches to the company's botanical gardens at Calcutta, but they were rejected as being another form of the flower camelia. However, when the 1830 questionnaire came round, Charles Bruce replied by sending actual tea seeds, plants, and processed leaves from Assam. The find was declared &quot;the most important and valuable&quot; ever made on agricultural or commercial resources of the Empire.
<br /><br />By this time, [b]<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUwOTAwOTczNC5odG1s" target="_blank">China's secret</a></strong> seems to have been out, for the company began importing seeds from China, and the first Assam-grown tea was sold in 1839. In 1848 the company sent the Scottish botanist Robert Fortune to China for plants, expert workmen, and tools. Disguised as a Chinese, he had earlier entered the forbidden interior of China in order to collect plants and seeds. It was Fortune who brought the news that green tea and black tea actually came from the same plant and differed only in processing.
<br /><br />The native strain of Assam tea in fact proved much better in the end. The Chinese plants did not do well in India, and their cultivation was abandoned, but not before they managed to crossbreed with the Indian strain and weaken it.
<br /><br />The Tea Committee probably had no inkling that from these experi- mental beginnings India would become the world's leading producer of tea. She holds this position today, with output exceeding a billion pounds and a million acres dedicated to tea gardens. Ceylon, formerly a coffee grower, became a producer of high quality tea after the crop was introduced in 1870 as an answer to a coffee blight.

<br /><br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/184532578_7068343_49964971.jpg" />
<br /><br />In 1767,the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUxMTAwOTczNi5odG1s" target="_blank">British Parliament</a></strong>passed the infamous act imposing duties on tea and other commodities imported by the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUxMTAwOTczNi5odG1s" target="_blank">American colonists</a></strong>. The colonists resisted by smuggling in tea from<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTUxMTAwOTczNi5odG1s" target="_blank">Holland</a></strong>. Although the other duties were repealed in 1770, the one on tea remained, so the colonists continued resorting to this illegal source.
<br /><br />By 1773, the British East India Company, already in financial trouble for internal reasons, had a surplus of 17 million pounds of tea in danger of going stale. So Parliament wrote off the company's debts, gave it a loan, and granted it a monopoly in the colonies through its chosen agents. This drove other American sellers into the legions of disgruntled citizens. The tax of threepence per pound was modest, and added little to Britain's revenues. What rankled was the idea. The tea tax was symbolic of many other grievances, and &quot;No taxation without re- presentation&quot; became a rallying cry.
<br /><br />The anger erupted in the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. Too little has been said about the role of the colonial women in the event. The East India Company, now underselling the smugglers, had expected the colonial women to go for their tea. But the insult of being sent stale leaves and taxed for them was the proverbial last straw on top of already high feeling. Pledging to use no tea at home or to boycott it completely, the women held meetings and initiated petitions. Their aim was to prevent the tea from being unloaded so that the duty would not be paid.
<br /><br />The women's action was not confined merely to the Boston area. The women of Edenton, North Carolina, for example, in a declaration published in a London paper, vowed &quot;not to conform to the pernicious custom of drinking tea, until such time as all Acts which tend to enslave our native country shall be repealed.&quot;
<br /><br />On December 16 after a meeting attended by 5,000, fifty men disguised as Indians and armed with hatchets and pistols attacked the three tea ships anchored at Boston. They broke open and dumped into the harbor the East India Company's entire Boston consignment, 342 chests valued at 10,000 pounds sterling. Patriotic anti-tea incidents took place in many parts of the colonies.
<br /><br />By the time the revolution began, most Americans had renounced tea drinking, for a time at least. The tax rankled even after the revolutionary victory. Witness these gloating comments by the poet Philip Freneau for the 1784 departure of the Empress of China, the first ship to China from the new United States:
<br /><br />She now her eager course explores, And soon shall greet Chinesian shores, From thence their fragrant TEAS to bring Without the leave of Britain's king.

<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU0MjAwOTc0OS5odG1s" target="_blank">Tea drinking</a></strong> for spiritual refreshment reaches its ultimate in the cha-no-yu, the tea ceremony for which Japan is famous. The cha-no-yu (meaning &quot;<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU0MjAwOTc0OS5odG1s" target="_blank">hot water for tea</a></strong>,&quot; so named to sound more impressive than just plain cha) is far more than a ceremony, or even a custom. More suitable is the term Way of Tea--a way of looking at things, an art of living intimately linked with artistic appreciation. In it are echoes of the early history of tea drinking in China, which developed into something uniquely Japanese when transplanted to the islands.The tea ceremony, even in its simpler form, is more than an elaborate ritual. It is an interlude in which one lends oneself for the moment to the spirit of beauty, quietude, and politeness toward others. The ceremony may be practiced anywhere, at home or in a teahouse.
<br /><br />Here is how it might take place in a large house which has a separate tearoom, actually a rustic tea hut, as has been the form since the late sixteenth century. (Note that this description covers only the main points of the ceremony, not all of the actions or those of any particular school.) Guests, no more than five, assemble in an arbor in the garden in preparation for entering the tearoom. In some schools of the tea ceremony, each will take out a small folded fan about five inches long and tuck it into his or her belt. It symbolizes the swords once used by the samurai warriors, and placing it correctly on the floor is an important part of the later ceremony.
<br /><br />Then the guests proceed down the &quot;dewy path&quot; of stepping stones. This passage through the quiet garden signifies breaking ties with the workaday world outside. The guests may be met at a central gate by the bowing hostess (more often than host these days) and wordlessly led into the inner garden. Or, they may not be greeted until she enters after they are seated.
<br /><br />At a stream of water trickling musically from a bamboo spout into a basin hollowed out of stone, built low to create an attitude of humility, the guests wash their hands and rinse their mouths. &quot;The sound of tinkling water splashing into the stone basin washes the dust from your mind,&quot; wrote the sixteenth century tea master Rikkyu. Nearby stands an artistic low stone lantern to light the path for evening. These two often come in fanciful shapes. The origin of the latter is believed to be a pagoda-shaped incense burner used in Korea.
<br /><br />The tea hut stands about two feet above the ground. Leaving their shoes behind, guests enter on their knees through a low, nearly square door again humility--which puts everyone on the same level. Beside the door hangs a decorative broom often used to clean the path of all but a few artistically-strewn leaves.
<br /><br />The room inside is rarely larger than four and a half tatami mats, or about ten feet square. This is the size of a room in which, according to a Buddhist sutra from India, KingVikramadytia greeted the bodhisattva Manjushiri and eighty-four thousand disciples, a tale implying that for the truly enlightened, space does not exist. The original characters for this room's Japanese name have been translated to mean &quot;abode of fancy.&quot;
<br /><br />The room is completely plain, but beautifully crafted of seasoned wood, with paper windows. Yet it will not be without its variety. No design repeats itself, no two of the tea things will be the same shape. In a shallow alcove hangs a scroll with a verse and occasionally an ink drawing. The calligraphy is changed to fit the &quot;theme&quot; of the season or that day’s ceremony. Placed below it or hanging on the wall is a vase with a single flower.
<br /><br />One can lose oneself for as long as four hours in the ceremony; its movements of bowing and handling the tea things follow a prescribed pattern. On their knees and bowing from the waist, the guests note with appreciation  the beauty of the scroll, the flower, and the finely crafted iron teakettle bubbling over a charcoal fire recessed in the floor. Then they sit back on their heels in appropriate places around the sides of the room.
<br /><br />According to some styles, the hostess will not enter until all the guests have been seated, and then brings in the tea things one by one. Such a service is described in The Book of Tea by one of the earliest modern commentators on the ceremony, Okakura Kakuzo.
<br /><br />Quiet reigns with nothing to break the silence save the note of the boiling water in the iron kettle. The kettle sings well, for pieces of  iron are so arranged in the bottom as to produce a peculiar melody in which one may hear the echoes of a cataract muffled by clouds, of a distant sea breaking among the rocks, a rainstorm sweeping through a bamboo forest, or of the soughing of pines on some faraway hill.
<br /><br />First comes a &quot;moist sweet, &quot;often of a gelatinous nature, and then a  one, both eaten with a pick piece by piece out of a paper napkin. Meanwhile the hostess rinses the drinking bowls with hot water and dry the used water into a special jar. She wipes each bowl with a cloth napkin three times.
<br /><br />The hostess puts the bright green powdered tea, matcha, into the first bowl with a long, thin scoop carved from bamboo, using a measure and a half. Then, adding enough water for three and a half mouthfuls, she whips the contents of the bowl to a beautiful light green froth with a tiny bamboo whisk, as was done in Song dynasty China. The principal guest takes the bowl, saying, &quot;Excuse me for drinking before you,&quot; and acknowledging the hostess's efforts with the words, &quot;I gratefully accept the tea you have prepared.&quot;
<br /><br />The tea finished, the drinker wipes the bowl with a paper napkin and turns it upside down to further examine its design and the mark of the craftsman, if it bears one, and the ceremony proceeds through all the guests. Then the tea caddy and other utensils are appreciated. &quot;What kind of caddy is this?&quot; asks the principal guest, along with other questions about origin and craftsmanship. Finally, the hostess removes the utensils and exchanges bows with each of the guests as they leave.

A chunk was cut off, roasted, rolled to break up the lump, and boiled in water. In his tea classic, <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1NzAwOTc1NS5odG1s" target="_blank">Lu Yu</a> </strong>describes a wide-mouthed iron cauldron used for boiling, but says silver is better for long wear. Salt, orange peel, onions, dogwood berries, or peppermint were boiled with the leaves or tossed in later. The brew was sipped from wide bowls. Lu Yu's tea was a complex operation involving altogether twenty-seven pieces of equipment including brazier and fire tools, various containers, scoop, roller, ladle, bowls, and basket for a set for ten. In case the host wanted an outdoors tea-and-poetry-writing excursion at a distant place, there was even a carryall into which could be fitted all the equipment, or &quot;equipage&quot; as it became known in another part of the world, England, in another century.
<br /><br />Although<strong> <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTU1NzAwOTc1NS5odG1s" target="_blank">Chinese ceramic</a></strong>pieces had handles since very early times, handleless bowls continued to be favored for tea. An inventive woman of the Tang dynasty, who is known only as the daughter of the military  official Cui Ning, made a major contribution to tea equipment--the saucer--sometime between 674 and 680. According to legend she regularly made tea for her father, but found it difficult to hand him the hot bowl. First she tried putting an iron plate underneath, but the bowl slipped around. Then she used a blob of wax to hold it, but that was unaesthetic. She finally asked a lacquer craftsman to make her a small plate with a circular ridge in the center to hold the cup, and the saucer was born. Cups and saucers came in sets from the Song dynasty on, but most bowls continued to be used without saucers until the Ming dynasty.

<br /><br />Fairly small handle less cups are used, along with those with handles. For all-day drinking, the preferred vessel is a tall mug about twice the size of a standard cup, with a matching lid. While many of these are of very ordinary china, beautifully decorated cups are treasured and enjoyed throughout life. Covered mugs of reddish brown <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYwMjAwOTc1OS5odG1s" target="_blank">Yixing stoneware</a></strong>, inexpensive, practical, and artistic, are popular.
<br /><br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYwMjAwOTc1OS5odG1s" target="_blank">Drinking glasses</a></strong>, of very thin material so they do not crack even when hot water is poured in, have also been used in recent decades. Some think this is the influence of the Russian tea glass. The difference is that the Russian glass rests in a wrought silver frame with a handle. Any hapless drinker who in a hurry for his tea has burned his fingers on an unclad Chinese glass may wonder whether this is an improvement.
<br /><br />Why do Russians use glasses? Mexandre Dumas, whose prolific nineteenth-century writing extended far beyond novels like The Three Musketeers, gives a legend in his Histoire de la Cuisine (translated as Dictionary of Cuisine). The first Russian teacups bore a view of the city of Kronstadt, where they were made. A teahouse customer, feeling the drink was too weak, would complain, &quot;I can see Kronstadt.&quot; Teahouses began substituting glasses, which showed exactly how strong the tea was.
<br /><br />The one advantage of glasses is aesthetic, because they make it possible to enjoy the floating world created by certain kinds of tea leaves as they unfold. With this criterion alone in mind, glasses might be recommended particularly for Gunpowder, Lung Ching, Baihao Yinzhen (White tea), Yinzhen, and Qiangang Huibai.

Polyphenols tend to reduce the formation of plaque, while fluoride strengthens tooth enamel so that it can resist decay. Some Chinese and American researchers have concluded independently that two or three cups a day, or, some say, only one of black tea, can decrease tooth decay.
<br /><br />The polyphenols bind themselves to mouth bacteria before the latter can form plaque, according to Dr. Laurence E. Wolinsky, associate professor of oral biology at the School of Dentistry of the University of California at Los Angeles. He found an exceptionally low rate of dental problems among people who drank a lot of tea.
<br /><br />A joint test in two other U.S. universities found that tea drinking &quot;significantly inhibited&quot; the growth of mouth bacteria. People who were tested with four different kinds of tea developed notably fewer cavities than those in a control group drinking plain water. The study, conducted at the Ohio State University College of Dentistry, Columbus, Ohio, and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, listed four teas sold under the names Young Hyson, Panfried, Lung Ching, and Chinese Green. <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcmllbnRhbGRpc2NvdmVyeS5jb20vaHRtbC8yMDEyLzAyLzIwMTIwMjA0MTYzOTAwOTc4OC5odG1s" target="_blank">Young Hyson</a></strong>and Panfried produced the best results. This was due, the report said, both to tannin and fluoride, probably more to the latter.
<br /><br />Chinese researchers say that the human body consumes from one to three milligrams of fluoride a day, which must be obtained from food and drink. Ten grams of tea leaves a day, enough for two cups of strong tea, will replace this, according to their calculations. Green tea contains twice as much fluoride as black, Dr. Sheldon Margen, professor of Public Health Nutrition at the University of California, wrote in the U.C. Berkeley FVellnessNewsletter. Since the mid- 1940s, fluoride has been added to drinking water in many communities in the United States and elsewhere. An analysis of the fluoride content of teas sold in the United States found a range of 1.32 to 4.18 parts per million (ppm), according to a U.S. study. Recommepded fluoridation of water in the United States ranges from 0.7 ppm in warm areas, where more water is drunk, to 1.2 ppm. Therefore anyone who drinks two cups a day of the highest-ranking tea would get 8.36 ppm per day, just a little less than someone who drinks 8 glasses of fluoridated water, taking in 9.6 ppm. Three cups of tea with less than the highest fluoride content ought to do the trick. Chinese researchers found that loose Gunpowder tea (a green tea) contains 100-150 ppm, 60 to 80 percent of which can be extracted.
<br /><br />While fluoridation of water is obviously desirable because it also reaches children, who are not generally tea drinkers, the information above should be good news for people who live in areas without fluoridation, for by drinking tea they can derive the same benefit. For sensitive teeth, a twice-daily rinsing of the mouth with tea before swallowing it, if done over a long period of time, is said to be effective.

Mthough certain strains of that plant are preferred for each type, the chief difference lies in processing. The main types of tea are black, which undergoes a process of oxidation, called fermentation; oolong, which is oxidized about half as long (semi-fermented); and green tea, which is not fermented. This process should really be called oxidation, for that is what happens to the leaves. They are not fermented, or worked on by biological microorganisms.

Some authorities say the name derives from the red edges on the leaves after fermentation, while others claim it refers to the red tint of certain black teas when brewed, such as the &quot;Keemun Red&quot; tea. Mainly green tea is drunk by Chinese, whether in or outside China.
