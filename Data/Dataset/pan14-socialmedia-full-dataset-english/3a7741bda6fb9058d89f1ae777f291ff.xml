<br /><br />The cannibal called the waiter over and asked, &quot;Why such a price difference for the politician?&quot;

<br />The owner says, &quot;Hmm. I only have pedigree animals here, but I think I have something in back,&quot; and he goes back and comes out with a bullfrog. He says, &quot;This is no ordinary bullfrog, this bullfrog gives blowjobs.&quot; 
<br /><br />Thinking the frog could save her a little work around the house, the lady said, &quot;I'll take it.&quot; 
<br /><br />She takes it home and gives it to her boyfriend, who is less than thrilled. She smiles and says, &quot;This is no ordinary bullfrog - I'm going to leave you two alone and let you get to know each other.&quot; 
<br /><br />About 45 minutes later, the lady hears pots and pans banging around in the kitchen, she runs in and yells, &quot;What the hell is going on around here!?&quot; 
<br /><br />The man looks up from a cookbook and says, &quot;If I can teach this frog how to cook you're outta here.&quot;

<br />&quot;Sir, what are you yelling about? You're scaring the customers.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Every time I try to flush the toilet something keeps biting my balls!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Sir, please get off the mop bucket.&quot;

<br />Infuriated, the woman slammed her fare into the fare box and took an aisle seat near the rear of the bus. The man seated next to her sensed that she was agitated and asked her what was wrong. 
<br /><br />&quot;The bus driver insulted me,&quot; she fumed. 
<br /><br />The man sympathized and said, &quot;Why, he shouldn't say things to insult passengers. He could be fired for that.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;You're right,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;That's a good idea,&quot; the man said. &quot;Here, let me hold your monkey.&quot;

<br /><br />A devoted wife had spent her lifetime taking care of her husband. Now he had been slipping in and out of a coma for several months, yet she stayed by his bedside every single day. When he came to his senses, he motioned for her to come near him. 
<br />As she sat by him, he said, ''''You know what? You have been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you were by my side. When we lost the house, you gave me support. When my health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?'''' 
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/dry.gif" alt=":)" /> ''''What, my dear?'''' she asked gently. 
<br /><br />''''I think you bring me bad luck.''''

<br />tiptoed through the living room but suddenly he froze in his tracks when
<br />he heard a loud voice say, &quot;Jesus is watching you!&quot;
<br /><br />Silence returned to the house, so the burglar crept forward again.
<br /><br />&quot;Jesus is watching you,&quot; the voice boomed again.
<br /><br />The burglar stopped dead again. He was frightened. Frantically, he looked
<br />all around. In a dark corner, he spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a
<br />parrot.
<br /><br />He asked the parrot, &quot;Was that you who said Jesus is watching me?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; said the parrot.
<br /><br />The burglar breathed a sigh of relief, and asked the parrot, &quot;What's your
<br />name?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Clarence,&quot; said the bird.
<br /><br />&quot;That's a stupid name for a parrot,&quot; sneered the burglar. &quot;What idiot
<br />would name a parrot Clarence?&quot;
<br /><br />The parrot said, &quot;The same idiot who named the Rottweiller Jesus.&quot;

He calls the bartender over and says, &quot;You should take that picture down. George Bush is a blight upon this nation. He should be impeached.&quot; 
<br /><br />The bartender, a life-long Republican, is completely offended. &quot;Why you liberal piece of garbage. How dare you come into my bar and tell me how to run my business!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Listen, I'm the customer, so I'm always right.&quot; the man says. &quot;That picture offends me, so I want you to take it down.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;That tears it,&quot; the bartender says, &quot;How would you like it if I came into your bar and told you what to do?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Well, you'd be the customer, so you'd be right,&quot; the man says. 
<br /><br />&quot;Fine, then let's switch places,&quot; the bartender says. 
<br /><br />So, they do. The man takes the bartender's place behind the bar, and the bartender walks outside, waits a moment, and then comes back inside. The bartender sits at the bar and says to the bar, &quot;You should take that pin off. The Democrats are destroying our country with their liberal agenda.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Sorry,&quot; the man says, &quot;but we don't serve Republicans here.&quot;

No matter how he tried to forget, he couldn't.  The sense of guilt and betrayal was overwhelming.  But every once and in a while he'd hear a reassuring voice that said &quot;Dave. Don't worry about it. You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of your patients and you won't be the last. And your single, just let it go.&quot;  Invariably, however, another nagging little voice would bring him back to reality, whispering, &quot;But Dave, your a vet!!!&quot;
