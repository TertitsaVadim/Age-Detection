<br /><br />I have something truly exciting and hot to tell you about today! You will want to take advantage of this right away and it is FREE!
<br />Based on two years of research and development, our unshakeable conviction is that this ground-breaking programme will send a shockwave around the Internet marketing world — making a six-figure income for many of the participants who ride the wave with us.
<br /><br />And to help you get well and truly participating, and far ahead of that wave, with our compliments you can now have your very own  &quot;EVO&quot; website. This not only gives you detailed ”inside information”, but also provides an automated prospecting system with which you can promote the business during its pre-launch phase.
<br /><br />Use your the site fully, and when we go live you’ll have gained ”First-Mover Advantage” — you’ll hit the ground running and be ahead of the pack, so to speak. Who knows, you may even be amongst those we realistically anticipate will earn a £10,000 or more commission cheque within the first month.
<br /><br />Based on market analyst DFC Intelligence’s figures, this market is currently worth $5.2 billion USD per annum — or $164 per second. In the next 156 weeks that figure is expected to escalate to a staggering $412 USD per second: every minute, every hour, of every day, and growing!
<br />As they say — and as these figures show — time is money. So you do NOT want to delay!
<br /><br />Just think about this: in every revolution, there are winners and losers. The winners will be those pioneers who use their insider knowledge and contacts to exploit emerging trends and ride the crest of the wave. The losers will be the bystanders who watch them make their fortune. The question is, which are you going to be?
<br /><br />Join me in this new Community and adventure! Remember what other sites have sold for...do you want to miss out on that? Click on the following link and sign up today!

<br /><br />As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that
<br />wasn't supposed to ever let you down probably will. You
<br />will have your heart broken probably more than once and
<br />it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so
<br />remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight
<br />with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things
<br />an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast,
<br />and you'll eventually lose someone you love.
<br />  So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never
<br />been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset
<br />is a minute of happiness you'll never get back.
<br />  Don't be afraid that your life will end, be afraid that it will never
<br />begin.

<br /><br />I used to have a comfort zone
<br />where I thought I could not fail,
<br />same four walls and busy work
<br />were really more like jail.
<br />I longed so much to do the things
<br />I had never done before,
<br />but I stayed inside my comfort zone
<br />and paced the same old floor.
<br />I said it didn't matter
<br />that I wasn't doing much,
<br /> I said I didn't care for things
<br />like diamonds, furs and such.
<br />I claimed to be so busy
<br />with things inside my zone,
<br />but deep inside I longed for
<br />something special of my own.
<br />I could not let life go by
<br />just watching others win,
<br />I held my breath and stepped outside
<br />and let the change begin.
<br />I took a step and with new strength
<br />I had never felt before,
<br />I kissed my comfort zone good bye
<br />and closed and locked the door.
<br />If you are in a comfort zone
<br />afraid to venture out,
<br />remember that all winners were
<br />at one time filled with doubt.
<br />A step or two and words of praise
<br />can make your dreams come true.
<br />Greet your future with a smile
<br />SUCCESS is there for you.

On Thursday, Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton , Colorado , was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful.
<br /><br />They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:
<br /><br />&quot;Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &amp; evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.
<br /><br />&quot;The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the N CA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain's heart.
<br /><br />&quot;In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder I would be their strongest opponent.
<br /><br />I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy -- it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best.
<br />Your laws ignore our deepest needs,
<br />Your words are empty air.
<br />You've stripped away our heritage,
<br />You've outlawed simple prayer.
<br />Now gunshots fill our classrooms,
<br />And precious children die.
<br />You seek for answers everywhere,
<br />And ask the question &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />You regulate restrictive laws,
<br />Through legislative creed.
<br />And yet you fail to understand,
<br />That God is what we need!
<br /><br />&quot;Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational
<br />systems for most of our nation's history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs -- politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts.
<br /><br />&quot;As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him. To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA -- I give to you a sincere challenge. Dare to examine your
<br />own heart before casting the first stone!
<br /><br />My daughter's death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!&quot;
<br /><br />Do what the media did not - - let the nation hear this man's speech.. Please send this out to everyone you can.

<br /><br />You are having a wonderful relationship. All is going well, or so you think. And then, something happens. You have your feelings hurt, or worse. What happened you ask? How could this be? Then the anger sets in, then the hurt and pain take over even more; a roller coaster ride of emotion runs its course. Now, you find yourself talking to others about what has developed within your relationship. They can not believe what has occurred. Like you, they feel hurt and anger. After all, they are your friends and they want to reach out and support you.
<br /><br />What follows are weeks filled with anger when ever you hear the person's name. It gets so bad that when you even see or hear the person's first name, your head goes to the side as a reaction and your lips contort and you have this uneasy feeling in the the pit of your stomach. 
<br /><br />It's a month later now. You still can't let go of how much pain you feel over what has happened, so much so that you are getting headaches. You have this way about you now. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can not let go of what can best be described as, “an unforgiving spirit &quot;. You even go out of your way to tell others that this entire matter “has made me heart sick.”
<br /><br />Over time, each of has had that moment when a relationship goes south. It can be a marriage, an argument on the job; you and your favorite person in the neighborhood don't agree, a church member seems to be acting like they can walk on water. The list can go on and on. What is important is that your “unforgiving spirit “ not go on.
<br /><br />Many in the medical field will tell you that holding on to such emotions can cause you severe health problems. It is important to YOU to take that first step toward forgiveness.  You might have tried to do this many times before and stopped short of your goal. However,   I can assure you, whether this is your very first attempt at forgiving someone or yourself, or you’ve walked with such hurt, shame, guilt or pain for years, you make an  important step in your life when you make an attempt to forgive another of a transgression, one that for sure has damaged your spirit; your life.  When you do try to find that place where forgiveness can grow and blossom, it is a defining moment.  You will find that, most definitely, your life will change for the better. 
<br /><br />Theologians and physicians alike agree that if you are a victim and survivor of sexual abuse, child abuse, emotional abuse,  rape, domestic abuse you are at the right place at the correct time and to forgive is the thing to do.
<br /><br />You're also at the correct place if you are angry, blaming yourself, blaming others, living secretively or being promiscuous. Now is the time to lay your unforgiving spirit to rest and allow your forgiving spirit to take its place.
<br /><br />When you forgive, you leave go of the pain. When you forgive, you  drop the baggage and instantaneously experience the lightness of peace and joy.
<br /><br />Before you do anything else today, take a moment to feel really good about yourself.  This is so very critical. You have to give yourself the credit and acknowledgement you deserve.  Wanting to forgive is not just that first step toward your destination of peace and love; it’s essentially more than that. 
<br /><br />Wanting to forgive means you have the purpose to forgive, which means you’re more than half way there. Your heart is in the right place when you want to forgive. For that you should be thankful. 
<br /><br />Today, find time to connect with someone that in the past has injured you in mind, body, or spirit. Reach out and even if you can't forget the way they did what they did, tell them, &quot; I forgive you &quot;. Maybe a letter or some kind of communication to help you feel better about what has happened because, quite frankly, this is about you. You are the one feeling the way you are and it is you that needs to feel the return of peace and joy that only THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS can bring.
<br /><br />Saying those three little words will mean so much to your spirit, your life.
<br /><br />Have a wonderful weekend and an even better rest of your life.
<br /><br />Joe Buccheri
