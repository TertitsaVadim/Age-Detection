Facebook alone should be able to drive significant traffic if utilized correctly. Start generating leads to your network marketing business using simple strategies like these.<br /><br />Maybe you no longer want to have a page or group that you've created or have become so fed up with Facebook that you want to delete your account altogether. Let me explain a few things to get clear what you want and how to do it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting or deactivating your account</strong><br /><br />If you no longer want to be actively using Facebook you have two options: either you can deactivate your account or permanently delete it. When you deactivate it then all your information is inaccessible to any other Facebook users. You may reactivate it later when you want to start using the service again.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;How to deactivate my account:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Simply click on 'Account' in the top right corner, choose 'Account Settings' from the drop-down menu and you'll find 'Deactivate Account' as the last option in the list. When you click on the blue link 'deactivate' you'll be guided to a screen with further instructions. Remember that any open groups you have created will no longer be editable. Read carefully through all the options available.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;How to delete my account:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />If you're absolutely sure that you no longer want to use Facebook, remember that you won't be able to retrieve any content or information you've added. To delete your account you have to submit a request on this page: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Fcontact.php%3Fshow_form%3Ddelete_account"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account</a><br /><br /><strong>Deleting a page</strong><br /><br />A page is an entity that you create to represent a business, public person, band, artist or company. If you simply no longer want a page that you have created go to the page, click 'Edit Page' underneath the profile picture. Then select 'Manage Permissions' in the left column. Click on 'Permanently delete this Page'. Please remember that one you've deleted your page you cannot reactivate it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting a group</strong><br /><br />The purpose of a group is to connect like-minded people or give information about a topic that is of interest to you and your group members, for example vegetarians. Facebook automatically deletes groups once they have no members left. To do this simply remove all members and then yourself. Only the first group creator will be able to delete the group, if he hasn't already left voluntarily.<br /><br />To remove the members click on 'Edit Members' on your group page below the profile picture. Simply click on the 'x' symbol beside the name and they will be deleted. Unfortunately you can only remove them one by one, which is a bit unfortunate if you have a group with lots of members.<br /><br />A common question that I have been asked multiple times is how to change the name on Facebook. This article will look at the step-by-step process to change your name, what is possible and what not.<br /><br /><strong>Personal profile page versus business page</strong><br /><br />First of all we need to clarify where you want to change a name:<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Personal profile page:&lt;/u&gt; This is where you have your personal information stored.

Simple - let me show you how.<br /><br /><strong>Search</strong><br /><br />The first step is to copy and paste the email address you have into the search box, which you will find on the top of the Facebook screen. That's all fine and dandy if you just wanted to push the &quot;product&quot;. We all know products will get sold but to whom? Who will get those sales? If you want to be the distributor responsible you need to differentiate from all the other distributors in your company. You might think y our only competing with other companies for business and you would be partially correct. You also need to compete with distributors in your own company.<br /><br />Lets say you are your own product. If that is the case, then you still need to promote yourself. Why buy from you? Selling your own product on Facebook depends a lot on advertising. Generic advertising that most do is blast information on their profile. This generally doesn't work. If your using your Facebook profile to sell someone you are probably already in trouble. People generally need to be pre-sold before coming to your site. Which means your advertising outside of Facebook has to do a lot of work before people come to you. Then again, Facebook doesn't really work like that anyways right? Who wants to be friends with a person who is a Giant advertisement? Do you really want some Facebook friend posting profile status and wall posts only to promote a product? That gets old quick, as people will realize that they are being used as a free advertising source.<br /><br />3 Free ways to grow your business in Facebook is to be a REAL person.<br /><br /><strong>1. Get a Real picture of You </strong><br /><br />I'm not talking about an avatar image. Most people think that you can add a cute picture of a cat or a giant image of your product and that will help you on Facebook. Facebook is generally used to network individuals and to do so you need a mug shot. Okay, maybe not a mug shot but get a picture with your good side. Some might like y our fancy car you have on you profile but how does that really connect you to your audience? You need to brand your own image onto people's minds. What makes you different from every other business out there? Don't get it confused.<br /><br />Example: If you sell Coke for a living and you have a Giant Coke image on your profile does that really help? Sure people know you either love Coke or work for them. How does that differentiate you from other Coke distributors? That Coke image doesn't set you apart from every other person with that same image. Your image is really the only picture you have to differentiate yourself. You want to stick out and not be filed as another Coke distributor.<br /><br /><strong>2. Set Your Region</strong><br /><br />People don't realize you can actually localize yourself in Facebook. Some people look over this because they are a global distributor. Your shooting yourself in the foot if you don't let yourself be found.

Simple - let me show you how.<br /><br /><strong>Search</strong><br /><br />The first step is to copy and paste the email address you have into the search box, which you will find on the top of the Facebook screen. People generally need to be pre-sold before coming to your site. Which means your advertising outside of Facebook has to do a lot of work before people come to you. Then again, Facebook doesn't really work like that anyways right? Who wants to be friends with a person who is a Giant advertisement? Do you really want some Facebook friend posting profile status and wall posts only to promote a product? That gets old quick, as people will realize that they are being used as a free advertising source.<br /><br />3 Free ways to grow your business in Facebook is to be a REAL person.<br /><br /><strong>1. Get a Real picture of You </strong><br /><br />I'm not talking about an avatar image. Most people think that you can add a cute picture of a cat or a giant image of your product and that will help you on Facebook. Facebook is generally used to network individuals and to do so you need a mug shot. Okay, maybe not a mug shot but get a picture with your good side. Some might like y our fancy car you have on you profile but how does that really connect you to your audience? You need to brand your own image onto people's minds. What makes you different from every other business out there? Don't get it confused.<br /><br />Example: If you sell Coke for a living and you have a Giant Coke image on your profile does that really help? Sure people know you either love Coke or work for them. How does that differentiate you from other Coke distributors? That Coke image doesn't set you apart from every other person with that same image. Your image is really the only picture you have to differentiate yourself. You want to stick out and not be filed as another Coke distributor.<br /><br /><strong>2. Set Your Region</strong><br /><br />People don't realize you can actually localize yourself in Facebook. Some people look over this because they are a global distributor. Your shooting yourself in the foot if you don't let yourself be found. Why would you want to block people from finding you? Isn't part of network marketing about having ways for people to find you easily? You want to be found by people who want your product or service. Easy ways to do this is by joining networks in Facebook or Neighborhoods. I recommend networks as that is shown on your profile easily.<br /><br />Many distributors are localized to states or even regions. Knowing exactly where people are will only help boost your sales. What if someone in your area wants to become a distributor but only wants to talk to someone who is local? Location information in this situation will be the difference between getting new business or being looked over.<br /><br />This is critical as there will be a time when you have enough traffic going through Facebook and many members will start to lean towards people in their region.

Click on the blue link on the right called 'change' and options to enter your name appear.<br /><br />3.     'Display Full Name' is the name that appears in a search. 'Alternate Name' will, if checked, also appear on your profile or in search results. 'Nickname' will appear between your first and your last name.<br /><br />Remember that Facebook will review each name change before they are approved. Depending on the amount of requests they have, this might take some time, at least 24 hours.<br /><br />Your name must be listed using characters of one language only and it cannot consist of titles, symbols, number, unusual capitalization, or punctuation. If you want to use other characters you might like to write your name in an alphabet commonly used in western culture as your alternate name.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Facebook page / business page:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Remember you can only make changes as long as you have less than 100 connections on your page.<br /><br />1.     Go to your page. Click on 'Edit Page' underneath the profile picture.<br /><br />2.     Change the name in the first section called 'Name' in the 'Basic Information' section.<br /><br />Facebook encourages people to use their real names. They therefore limit the number of times names can be changed. Impersonating anyone or anything is not permitted; Facebook however has not yet reacted when I reported such impersonation of artists I represent.<br /><br />So you want to use Facebook to grow your business? You setup your profile and place a ton of your company information and your contact information on it so when people stumble on it they can contact you. Most then add a ton of pictures of their products and links to how it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. That's all fine and dandy if you just wanted to push the &quot;product&quot;. We all know products will get sold but to whom? Who will get those sales? If you want to be the distributor responsible you need to differentiate from all the other distributors in your company. You might think y our only competing with other companies for business and you would be partially correct. You also need to compete with distributors in your own company.<br /><br />Lets say you are your own product. If that is the case, then you still need to promote yourself. Why buy from you? Selling your own product on Facebook depends a lot on advertising. Generic advertising that most do is blast information on their profile. This generally doesn't work. If your using your Facebook profile to sell someone you are probably already in trouble. People generally need to be pre-sold before coming to your site.

This article will look at the different cases and what you can do about photos of you.<br /><br /><strong>Your own photos</strong><br /><br />If you have uploaded the photos yourself, it is a very easy procedure: simply go to the specific photo. This means that the photo will no longer appear under your profile and your friend (or anyone else) will also no longer be able to tag you in this specific photo. This does not however mean that it disappears from their photos. Anyone connected to them will still be able to see it among their photos.<br /><br /><strong>Abusive photos</strong><br /><br />If you find a photo posted about you is abusive in its content you can anonymously report it by clicking 'Report This Photo', a link that you will find in the bottom right corner below the photo. Remember that this does not work if you just don't like the way you look in a photo.<br /><br /><strong>Delete a profile photo</strong><br /><br />Given that you have uploaded your profile photo you can easily delete it by clicking on your current picture, selecting the 'Remove as Profile Picture' link below the photo. You can then also delete the photo, which means no one will be able to see it anymore.<br /><br /><strong>Change your privacy settings</strong><br /><br />An easy way to control whom can see which pictures of you, whether you've uploaded them or someone else is to set your privacy setting accordingly. To do this go to 'Account', which you find on the top right of your Facebook screen next to Home and Profile, click on 'Privacy Settings' and you'll find a window pop up containing your setting called 'Sharing on Facebook'. You will find some preset setting which you can personalize simply by clicking on the 'Customize settings' link.<br /><br />So you want to use Facebook to grow your business? You setup your profile and place a ton of your company information and your contact information on it so when people stumble on it they can contact you. Most then add a ton of pictures of their products and links to how it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. That's all fine and dandy if you just wanted to push the &quot;product&quot;.

If you simply no longer want a page that you have created go to the page, click 'Edit Page' underneath the profile picture. Then select 'Manage Permissions' in the left column. Click on 'Permanently delete this Page'. Please remember that one you've deleted your page you cannot reactivate it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting a group</strong><br /><br />The purpose of a group is to connect like-minded people or give information about a topic that is of interest to you and your group members, for example vegetarians. Facebook automatically deletes groups once they have no members left. To do this simply remove all members and then yourself. Only the first group creator will be able to delete the group, if he hasn't already left voluntarily.<br /><br />To remove the members click on 'Edit Members' on your group page below the profile picture. Simply click on the 'x' symbol beside the name and they will be deleted. Unfortunately you can only remove them one by one, which is a bit unfortunate if you have a group with lots of members.<br /><br />With the immense popularity of Facebook, the whole world seems like a small interconnected place. Needless to say, Facebook has taken the concept of social networking to a whole new level. Whether you are looking to have some fun online or you are purely looking to socialize with old and new acquaintance, Facebook would mean the world to you. Today, it comes as no surprise to learn that millions of people across the world tune in to Facebook during their spare time. So, would you like to have more information about Facebook getting started? Let me provide you with a step by step blueprint on how to get started with Facebook.<br /><br />First and foremost, you need to visit the official website of Facebook. On the homepage, you will witness the &quot;Sign Up&quot; section. All you need to do is feed in your personal information such as name, email address, date of birth, gender and password. Once you fill out your personal information on the homepage, you will have to click on the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button. After clicking on the &quot;Sign Up&quot; button, you will be asked to enter the security code that will be displayed on the next screen.<br /><br />After entering the security code, you will be sent a confirmation email. You will have to check your inbox to access the confirmation email. Click on the link provided in the Facebook confirmation email. You will be taken to a page which will read, &quot;Getting Started&quot;. Facebook comes with an inbuilt feature that allows you to view and add friends that are already in your email list. You will be presented with an option to accept or reject the friends. You will have to click on &quot;Confirm&quot; to move on to the next step.<br /><br />The next step would be to update your profile. You will be asked to include other basic information about yourself such as the name of your school, place of employment etc. Once you fill up this information, you will be taken to a page that displays users that have updated similar information on their profile, so that you can add them to your friends list.

It Is Really Up To You! </strong><br /><br />As mentioned, this tactic is quite manipulative. However, that does not mean it is unethical.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it depends on your intention.<br /><br />If you truly love your ex and want to take care of them forever, this tactic can help you achieve your goal.<br /><br />If you are just using this tactic to get your ex back and dump them again for revenge, this is obviously unethical.<br /><br />I really hope you have the right intention before you read on to learn more.<br /><br /><strong>How To Use Your Ex's Curiosity To Your Advantage</strong><br /><br />It doesn't matter whether it is your ex who dumps you or you who dump your ex, you can actually use Facebook to get your ex back.<br /><br />First, you need to understand that human beings are curious by nature. If you have just broken up, you are advised not to contact your ex for the time being. Sooner or later, your ex is going to start thinking about you. Your ex is going to be curious about what is going on in your life and why you are not contacting them.<br /><br />And when your ex is curious, what do you think they will do? Well, they are going to 'take a look' at your Facebook account.<br /><br /><strong>You Need To Show Your Ex That You Have Moved On Using Facebook</strong><br /><br />I know it may sound a little bit counterintuitive. You may think that if you want to get your ex back, you need to be focusing on them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is not true. Sometimes, the harder you try, the faster you push your ex away. Therefore, a much better way to get your ex back is to move on.<br /><br />Go out with friends. Socialize more. Participate in more activities. Do all the things that you haven't been doing while you were still in that relationship.<br /><br />And of course, you want to take photos and post those photos on your Facebook account.<br /><br />When your ex visit your Facebook account and see this new side of you, they will be surprised. In fact, they may even have a tinge of regret for breaking up with you.<br /><br />This is what you are trying to achieve. You want to make your ex regret breaking up with you even if it is just a little bit.<br /><br /><strong>How to Make Your Ex Jealous And Crazy</strong><br /><br />Here is the manipulative part. You can take a photo with another guy/gal. However, please use this tactic with caution. It can backfire on you if you do it wrongly.<br /><br /><strong>Take Group Photo! Not Individual Photo! </strong><br /><br />Some people may recommend that you just take a photo with another guy/gal and use it as your profile photo on Facebook.<br /><br />This can really backfire on you for several reasons.<br /><br />First, your ex may think that you are in a new relationship and totally give up hope on getting back together with you. Second, your ex may realize that you are just trying to make them jealous and feel disgusted with you.<br /><br />Therefore, I advise you to take a group photo with a group of friends instead of individual photo with just you and the other guy/gal.<br /><br />Of course, in all the group photos, you want to make sure that the other guy/gal is standing beside you.<br /><br />Just this alone is enough to make your ex jealous.

When you scroll down you will find a link on the left side saying: 'Delete This Photo'. Once you've clicked on it, it will ask you a double check question just to make sure you didn't accidentally click on the link. Once you confirm the question the photo will be deleted.<br /><br />You can also delete multiple photos by going to an album and clicking on 'Edit Album Info'. Go to 'Edit Photos' and you will find a little box to click beneath the photo saying 'Delete this photo'.<br /><br /><strong>Photos other people have posted</strong><br /><br />You cannot delete photos that other people have posted however you can un-tag yourself by clicking on 'Remove Tag' at the bottom next to your name.

Then select 'Manage Permissions' in the left column. Click on 'Permanently delete this Page'. Please remember that one you've deleted your page you cannot reactivate it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting a group</strong><br /><br />The purpose of a group is to connect like-minded people or give information about a topic that is of interest to you and your group members, for example vegetarians. Facebook automatically deletes groups once they have no members left. To do this simply remove all members and then yourself. Only the first group creator will be able to delete the group, if he hasn't already left voluntarily.<br /><br />To remove the members click on 'Edit Members' on your group page below the profile picture. Simply click on the 'x' symbol beside the name and they will be deleted. Unfortunately you can only remove them one by one, which is a bit unfortunate if you have a group with lots of members.<br /><br />Recently a friend of mine on Facebook asked the question: 'How can I delete photos off Facebook?' This article will look at the different cases and what you can do about photos of you.<br /><br /><strong>Your own photos</strong><br /><br />If you have uploaded the photos yourself, it is a very easy procedure: simply go to the specific photo. When you scroll down you will find a link on the left side saying: 'Delete This Photo'. Once you've clicked on it, it will ask you a double check question just to make sure you didn't accidentally click on the link. Once you confirm the question the photo will be deleted.<br /><br />You can also delete multiple photos by going to an album and clicking on 'Edit Album Info'. Go to 'Edit Photos' and you will find a little box to click beneath the photo saying 'Delete this photo'.<br /><br /><strong>Photos other people have posted</strong><br /><br />You cannot delete photos that other people have posted however you can un-tag yourself by clicking on 'Remove Tag' at the bottom next to your name. This means that the photo will no longer appear under your profile and your friend (or anyone else) will also no longer be able to tag you in this specific photo. This does not however mean that it disappears from their photos. Anyone connected to them will still be able to see it among their photos.<br /><br /><strong>Abusive photos</strong><br /><br />If you find a photo posted about you is abusive in its content you can anonymously report it by clicking 'Report This Photo', a link that you will find in the bottom right corner below the photo. Remember that this does not work if you just don't like the way you look in a photo.<br /><br /><strong>Delete a profile photo</strong><br /><br />Given that you have uploaded your profile photo you can easily delete it by clicking on your current picture, selecting the 'Remove as Profile Picture' link below the photo. You can then also delete the photo, which means no one will be able to see it anymore.<br /><br /><strong>Change your privacy settings</strong><br /><br />An easy way to control whom can see which pictures of you, whether you've uploaded them or someone else is to set your privacy setting accordingly.

Makes it look like your either hiding something or you got something to hide. People want to network with people they know. It's hard to do that if you got a picture of a cat and you have no clue to what they do in their spare time. Even worse, you don't even k now what they do professionally. I totally recommend you put where you worked full time or working now.<br /><br />Education is also a key. Stating where you went to a University and what you studied will help you relate to many people on Facebook. People get addicted to adding a ton of applications and their page slows to a crawl. The NEW Facebook has now placed information in different tabs to break up it up and make it easier to see where someone is and what they do for a living.<br /><br />Can Facebook Really Be Used For Business? Of course!<br /><br />There are many simple ways to promote your business using Facebook. Facebook alone should be able to drive significant traffic if utilized correctly. Start generating leads to your network marketing business using simple strategies like these.<br /><br />Maybe you no longer want to have a page or group that you've created or have become so fed up with Facebook that you want to delete your account altogether. Let me explain a few things to get clear what you want and how to do it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting or deactivating your account</strong><br /><br />If you no longer want to be actively using Facebook you have two options: either you can deactivate your account or permanently delete it. When you deactivate it then all your information is inaccessible to any other Facebook users. You may reactivate it later when you want to start using the service again.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;How to deactivate my account:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Simply click on 'Account' in the top right corner, choose 'Account Settings' from the drop-down menu and you'll find 'Deactivate Account' as the last option in the list. When you click on the blue link 'deactivate' you'll be guided to a screen with further instructions. Remember that any open groups you have created will no longer be editable. Read carefully through all the options available.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;How to delete my account:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />If you're absolutely sure that you no longer want to use Facebook, remember that you won't be able to retrieve any content or information you've added. To delete your account you have to submit a request on this page: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Fcontact.php%3Fshow_form%3Ddelete_account"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account</a><br /><br /><strong>Deleting a page</strong><br /><br />A page is an entity that you create to represent a business, public person, band, artist or company. If you simply no longer want a page that you have created go to the page, click 'Edit Page' underneath the profile picture. Then select 'Manage Permissions' in the left column. Click on 'Permanently delete this Page'. Please remember that one you've deleted your page you cannot reactivate it.<br /><br /><strong>Deleting a group</strong><br /><br />The purpose of a group is to connect like-minded people or give information about a topic that is of interest to you and your group members, for example vegetarians.

Simple - let me show you how.<br /><br /><strong>Search</strong><br /><br />The first step is to copy and paste the email address you have into the search box, which you will find on the top of the Facebook screen. Unfortunately you can only remove them one by one, which is a bit unfortunate if you have a group with lots of members.<br /><br />So you want to use Facebook to grow your business? You setup your profile and place a ton of your company information and your contact information on it so when people stumble on it they can contact you. Most then add a ton of pictures of their products and links to how it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. That's all fine and dandy if you just wanted to push the &quot;product&quot;. We all know products will get sold but to whom? Who will get those sales? If you want to be the distributor responsible you need to differentiate from all the other distributors in your company. You might think y our only competing with other companies for business and you would be partially correct. You also need to compete with distributors in your own company.<br /><br />Lets say you are your own product. If that is the case, then you still need to promote yourself. Why buy from you? Selling your own product on Facebook depends a lot on advertising. Generic advertising that most do is blast information on their profile. This generally doesn't work. If your using your Facebook profile to sell someone you are probably already in trouble. People generally need to be pre-sold before coming to your site. Which means your advertising outside of Facebook has to do a lot of work before people come to you. Then again, Facebook doesn't really work like that anyways right? Who wants to be friends with a person who is a Giant advertisement? Do you really want some Facebook friend posting profile status and wall posts only to promote a product? That gets old quick, as people will realize that they are being used as a free advertising source.<br /><br />3 Free ways to grow your business in Facebook is to be a REAL person.<br /><br /><strong>1. Get a Real picture of You </strong><br /><br />I'm not talking about an avatar image. Most people think that you can add a cute picture of a cat or a giant image of your product and that will help you on Facebook. Facebook is generally used to network individuals and to do so you need a mug shot. Okay, maybe not a mug shot but get a picture with your good side. Some might like y our fancy car you have on you profile but how does that really connect you to your audience? You need to brand your own image onto people's minds. What makes you different from every other business out there? Don't get it confused.<br /><br />Example: If you sell Coke for a living and you have a Giant Coke image on your profile does that really help? Sure people know you either love Coke or work for them. How does that differentiate you from other Coke distributors? That Coke image doesn't set you apart from every other person with that same image. Your image is really the only picture you have to differentiate yourself.

Please Be Ethical!</strong><br /><br />Before we continue, I need to let you know that the tactic you are going to learn is considered manipulative.<br /><br /><strong>Manipulative? Yes! Effective? Of Course!</strong><br /><br />The reason I am sharing this tactic with you is because it is extremely effective. Of course, I am not going to say that it works for everyone or every situation.<br /><br />For example, if your ex broke up with you because you cheated, then this tactic is obviously not going to work.

You may think that if you want to get your ex back, you need to be focusing on them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is not true. Sometimes, the harder you try, the faster you push your ex away. Therefore, a much better way to get your ex back is to move on.<br /><br />Go out with friends. Socialize more. Participate in more activities. Do all the things that you haven't been doing while you were still in that relationship.<br /><br />And of course, you want to take photos and post those photos on your Facebook account.<br /><br />When your ex visit your Facebook account and see this new side of you, they will be surprised. In fact, they may even have a tinge of regret for breaking up with you.<br /><br />This is what you are trying to achieve. You want to make your ex regret breaking up with you even if it is just a little bit.<br /><br /><strong>How to Make Your Ex Jealous And Crazy</strong><br /><br />Here is the manipulative part. You can take a photo with another guy/gal. However, please use this tactic with caution. It can backfire on you if you do it wrongly.<br /><br /><strong>Take Group Photo! Not Individual Photo! </strong><br /><br />Some people may recommend that you just take a photo with another guy/gal and use it as your profile photo on Facebook.<br /><br />This can really backfire on you for several reasons.<br /><br />First, your ex may think that you are in a new relationship and totally give up hope on getting back together with you. Second, your ex may realize that you are just trying to make them jealous and feel disgusted with you.<br /><br />Therefore, I advise you to take a group photo with a group of friends instead of individual photo with just you and the other guy/gal.<br /><br />Of course, in all the group photos, you want to make sure that the other guy/gal is standing beside you.<br /><br />Just this alone is enough to make your ex jealous. At least, your ex will not jump to conclusion that you are in a new relationship or you are just trying to make them jealous.<br /><br />In fact, these group photos will cause your ex to think whether both of you are in a relationship. They will come chasing after you before you are snatched by the other guy/gal.<br /><br /><strong>But What If My Ex Doesn't Visit My Facebook Profile? </strong><br /><br />If that is the case, you need to be more proactive and contact your ex.<br /><br />Maybe you no longer want to have a page or group that you've created or have become so fed up with Facebook that you want to delete your account altogether.
