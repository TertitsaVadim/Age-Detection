<br /><br />In this heart
<br />there was a place
<br />that remained alone,
<br />an empty space.
<br /><br />The heart was shattered
<br />torn, ripped, and used
<br />was hard to believe
<br />it could be refused.
<br /><br />It took awhile longer,
<br />scars back on the mend,
<br />now it beats faster
<br />for a brand new friend.
<br /><br />A smile was born
<br />and push came to shove
<br />this heart has found
<br />a brand new love.

<br />Or are my tears invisible to your eye?
<br />Why can't anyone see my pain?
<br />Isn't in my eyes plain?
<br />Why am I so sad
<br />These feelings are driving me mad
<br /><br />I long for the comfort of darkness
<br />Where it is easy to be fearless
<br />No one can see me cry
<br />No one can see the pain in my eye
<br />Why am I so sad
<br />I think I am going mad
<br /><br />Once it was so easy to be true
<br />Now all my feelings are turning blue
<br />Its like a dream into a nightmare
<br />Where do I go? I know not where
<br />Why am I so sad
<br />When everyone says I should be glad
<br /><br />Oh all the things I long to say
<br />But do not dare let them see the light of day
<br />What is right can not be wrong
<br />How these feelings can burn so long
<br />Why am I so sad
<br />can't you let it go just a tad
<br /><br />The secret that I keep
<br />Put to bed but, will not sleep
<br />Oh inside it keeps on burning
<br />With that secret yearning

<br />Hardly do I know you by sight 
<br />You return at some hour of the night to a house at an angle to my window 
<br />A wholly imaginary house 
<br />It is there that from one second to the next 
<br />In the inviolate darkness 
<br />I anticipate once more the fascinating rift occurring 
<br />The one and only rift 
<br />In the facade and in my heart 
<br />The closer I come to you 
<br />In reality 
<br />The more the key sings at the door of the unknown room 
<br />Where you appear alone before me 
<br />At first you coalesce entirely with the brightness 
<br />The elusive angle of a curtain 
<br />It's a field of jasmine I gazed upon at dawn on a road in the vicinity of Grasse 
<br />With the diagonal slant of its girls picking 
<br />Behind them the dark falling wing of the plants stripped bare 
<br />Before them a T-square of dazzling light 
<br />The curtain invisibly raised 
<br />In a frenzy all the flowers swarm back in 
<br />It is you at grips with that too long hour never dim enough until sleep 
<br />You as though you could be 
<br />The same except that I shall perhaps never meet you 
<br />You pretend not to know I am watching you 
<br />Marvelously I am no longer sure you know 
<br />You idleness brings tears to my eyes 
<br />A swarm of interpretations surrounds each of your gestures 
<br />It's a honeydew hunt 
<br />There are rocking chairs on a deck there are branches that may well scratch you in the forest 
<br />There are in a shop window in the rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette 
<br />Two lovely crossed legs caught in long stockings 
<br />Flaring out in the center of a great white clover 
<br />There is a silken ladder rolled out over the ivy 
<br />There is 
<br />By my leaning over the precipice 
<br />Of your presence and your absence in hopeless fusion 
<br />My finding the secret 
<br />Of loving you 
<br />Always for the first time

<br />I seldom feel myself alone,
<br />For fancy fills my dreaming eye
<br />With scenes and pleasures of its own. 
<br />Then I may cherish at my breast
<br />An infant's form beloved and fair,
<br />May smile and soothe it into rest
<br />With all a Mother's fondest care. 
<br /><br />How sweet to feel its helpless form
<br />Depending thus on me alone!
<br />And while I hold it safe and warm
<br />What bliss to think it is my own! 
<br /><br />And glances then may meet my eyes
<br />That daylight never showed to me;
<br />What raptures in my bosom rise,
<br />Those earnest looks of love to see, 
<br /><br />To feel my hand so kindly prest,
<br />To know myself beloved at last,
<br />To think my heart has found a rest,
<br />My life of solitude is past! 
<br /><br />But then to wake and find it flown,
<br />The dream of happiness destroyed,
<br />To find myself unloved, alone,
<br />What tongue can speak the dreary void?
<br /><br />A heart whence warm affections flow,
<br />Creator, thou hast given to me,
<br />And am I only thus to know
<br />How sweet the joys of love would be?

<br />Starry nights and windless chimes
<br />That ring out in the midst of a silent night
<br />On a wintry day.
<br />Without the snow
<br />And biting cold,
<br />Without mufflers and mittens
<br />To envelope necks and hands...
<br />Two souls are met
<br />In the holy M
<br />To love and cherish and hold
<br />For eternity.
<br /><br />Thus weddings always go,
<br />And forward march unto this day,
<br />The rose petals and the white lace
<br />Fresh in minds,
<br />Even as the winter appears once again
<br />The season wherein life together first began
<br />And goes on and on each year.
<br />Everyday a reminder thus
<br />Of years gone by and years still
<br />In line to pass...
<br />Of summers spent and winters fled,
<br />Of autumns fallen and rains washed by,
<br />Of springs hopping past...
<br />Each year goes by so very soon,
<br />It does not feel like seventeen years have past,
<br />But it must be true...
<br />For hark! The bells they chime.... This seventeenth Wedding Anniversary To beckon forth.... It's here at last, that day..... To celebrate seventeen years of love and luck And smile upon many a year as such to come!

<br />Gazed on each other, till a fierce unrest 
<br />Surged 'neath the meadow's seemingly calm breast,
<br />And all the mountain's fissures ran with fire. 
<br />A mighty river rolled between them there. 
<br />What could the mountain do but gaze and burn?
<br />What could the meadow do but look and yearn,
<br />And gem its bosom to conceal despair? 
<br />Their seething passion agitated space, 
<br />Till lo! the lands a sudden earthquake shook, 
<br />The river fled: the meadow leaped, and took 
<br />The leaning mountain in a close embrace.

<br /><br />Under the sloped snow 
<br />pinned all winter with Christmas 
<br />lights, we waited for your father 
<br />to whittle his soap cakes 
<br />away, finish the whisky, 
<br />your mother carry her coffee 
<br />from room to room closing lights 
<br />cubed in the snow at our feet. 
<br />Holding each other’s 
<br />coat sleeves we slid down 
<br />the roads in our tight 
<br />black dresses, past 
<br />crystal swamps and the death 
<br />face of each dark house, 
<br />over the golden ice 
<br />of tobacco spit, the blue 
<br />quiet of ponds, with town 
<br />glowing behind the blind 
<br />white hills and a scant 
<br />snow ticking in the stars. 
<br />You hummed blanche comme 
<br />la neige and spoke of Montreal 
<br />where a québecoise could sing, 
<br />take any man’s face 
<br />to her unfastened blouse 
<br />and wake to wine 
<br />on the bedside table. 
<br />I always believed this, 
<br />Victoria, that there might 
<br />be a way to get out. 
<br /><br />You were ashamed of that house, 
<br />its round tins of surplus flour, 
<br />chipped beef and white beans, 
<br />relief checks and winter trips 
<br />that always ended in deer 
<br />tied stiff to the car rack, 
<br />the accordion breath of your uncles 
<br />down from the north, and what 
<br />you called the stupidity 
<br />of the Michigan French. 
<br /><br />Your mirror grew ringed 
<br />with photos of servicemen 
<br />who had taken your breasts 
<br />in their hands, the buttons 
<br />of your blouses in their teeth, 
<br />who had given you the silk 
<br />tassels of their graduation, 
<br />jackets embroidered with dragons 
<br />from the Far East. You kept 
<br />the corks that had fired 
<br />from bottles over their beds 
<br />their letters with each city 
<br />blackened, envelopes of hair 
<br />from their shaved heads. 
<br /><br />I am going to have it, you said. 
<br />Flowers wrapped in paper from carts 
<br />in Montreal, a plane lifting out 
<br />of Detroit, a satin bed, a table 
<br />cluttered with bottles of scent. 
<br />So standing in a platter of ice 
<br />outside a Catholic dance hall 
<br />you took their collars 
<br />in your fine chilled hands 
<br />and lied your age to adulthood. 
<br /><br />I did not then have breasts of my own, 
<br />nor any letters from bootcamp 
<br />and when one of the men who had 
<br />gathered around you took my mouth 
<br />to his own there was nothing 
<br />other than the dance hall music 
<br />rising to the arms of iced trees. 
<br /><br />I don’t know where you are now, Victoria. 
<br />They say you have children, a trailer 
<br />in the snow near our town, 
<br />and the husband you found as a girl 
<br />returned from the Far East broken 
<br />cursing holy blood at the table 
<br />where nightly a pile of white shavings 
<br />is paid from the edge of his knife. 
<br /><br />If you read this poem, write to me. 
<br />I have been to Paris since we parted.

<br /><br />What will be served for our reception 
<br />in the devastation? Finger food, of course 
<br />and white wine, something printed on the napkins. 
<br /><br />We were not children together 
<br />but we are now. Every bird knows 
<br />only two notes constantly rearranged. 
<br /><br />That’s called forever so we wear pajamas 
<br />to the practice funeral, buckeroos 
<br />to the end. We make paper hats 
<br />of headlines and float them away. 
<br /><br />My home made of smoke, 
<br />tiny spider made of punctuation, 
<br />my favorite poem is cinder 
<br />scratched into a sidewalk. 
<br /><br />My friend’s becoming the simplest man, 
<br />he sees a lesson in everything, 
<br />in missing his train, 
<br />in his son hollering from the ?rst branch, 
<br />Dad, guess where I am. 
<br /><br />I was with him for my ?rst magpies, 
<br />governmental and acting like hell. 
<br />And the new nickel 
<br />with Washington hard to recognize. 
<br /><br />We’d driven by a Rabbit flattened 
<br />by an upset truck, jars of Miracle Whip 
<br />broken over the toll road in heavy snow. 
<br /><br />We watched an old lady 
<br />eat a hot dog in a bun 
<br />with a knife and fork. 
<br /><br />A few emeralds winged off 
<br />a fruit leaf. 
<br /><br />What happens when your head splits open 
<br />and the bird flies out, its two notes deranged? 
<br />You got better, I got better, 
<br />wildflowers rimmed the crater, 
<br />glitter glitter glitter. 
<br /><br />We knew someone whose father died 
<br />then we knew ourselves. 
<br />Astronomer, gladiator, 
<br />thief, a tombstone salesman. 
<br /><br />All our vacations went to the sea 
<br />that breathed two times a day 
<br />without a machine. 
<br />We got in trouble with a raft 
<br />doing what we promised not to. 
<br /><br />Further out to be brought further back. 
<br /><br />There’s my friend in his squashed hat 
<br />trying to determine if a dot 
<br />is a living thing and do no harm. 
<br /><br />He’s having trouble remembering street names 
<br />but there’s still plenty of Thoreau. 
<br /><br />All that a human is made of is gold, 
<br />very very little gold.

<br /><br />I asked for much; I received much. 
<br />I asked for much; I received little, I received 
<br />next to nothing. 
<br /><br />And between? A few umbrellas opened indoors. 
<br />A pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table. 
<br /><br />O wrong, wrong—it was my nature. I was 
<br />hard-hearted, remote. I was 
<br />selfish, rigid to the point of tyranny. 
<br /><br />But I was always that person, even in early childhood. 
<br />Small, dark-haired, dreaded by the other children. 
<br />I never changed. Inside the glass, the abstract 
<br />tide of fortune turned 
<br />from high to low overnight. 
<br /><br />Was it the sea? Responding, maybe, 
<br />to celestial force? To be safe, 
<br />I prayed. I tried to be a better person. 
<br />Soon it seemed to me that what began as terror 
<br />and matured into moral narcissism 
<br />might have become in fact 
<br />actual human growth. Maybe 
<br />this is what my friends meant, taking my hand, 
<br />telling me they understood 
<br />the abuse, the incredible shit I accepted, 
<br />implying (so I once thought) I was a little sick 
<br />to give so much for so little. 
<br />Whereas they meant I was good (clasping my hand intensely)— 
<br />a good friend and person, not a creature of pathos. 
<br /><br />I was not pathetic! I was writ large, 
<br />like a queen or a saint. 
<br /><br />Well, it all makes for interesting conjecture. 
<br />And it occurs to me that what is crucial is to believe 
<br />in effort, to believe some good will come of simply trying, 
<br />a good completely untainted by the corrupt initiating impulse 
<br />to persuade or seduce— 
<br /><br />What are we without this? 
<br />Whirling in the dark universe, 
<br />alone, afraid, unable to influence fate— 
<br /><br />What do we have really? 
<br />Sad tricks with ladders and shoes, 
<br />tricks with salt, impurely motivated recurring 
<br />attempts to build character. 
<br />What do we have to appease the great forces? 
<br /><br />And I think in the end this was the question 
<br />that destroyed Agamemnon, there on the beach, 
<br />the Greek ships at the ready, the sea 
<br />invisible beyond the serene harbor, the future 
<br />lethal, unstable: he was a fool, thinking 
<br />it could be controlled. He should have said 
<br />I have nothing, I am at your mercy.

<br /><br />1 
<br /><br />Come, my Lucasia, since we see 
<br />      That Miracles Mens faith do move, 
<br />By wonder and by prodigy 
<br />      To the dull angry world let’s prove 
<br />      There’s a Religion in our Love. 
<br /><br />2 
<br /><br />For though we were design’d t’ agree, 
<br />      That Fate no liberty destroyes, 
<br />But our Election is as free 
<br />      As Angels, who with greedy choice 
<br />      Are yet determin’d to their joyes. 
<br /><br />3 
<br /><br />Our hearts are doubled by the loss, 
<br />      Here Mixture is Addition grown ; 
<br />We both diffuse, and both ingross : 
<br />      And we whose minds are so much one, 
<br />      Never, yet ever are alone. 
<br /><br />4 
<br /><br />We court our own Captivity 
<br />      Than Thrones more great and innocent : 
<br />’Twere banishment to be set free, 
<br />      Since we wear fetters whose intent 
<br />      Not Bondage is, but Ornament. 
<br /><br />5 
<br /><br />Divided joyes are tedious found, 
<br />      And griefs united easier grow : 
<br />We are our selves but by rebound, 
<br />      And all our Titles shuffled so, 
<br />      Both Princes, and both Subjects too. 
<br /><br />6 
<br /><br />Our Hearts are mutual Victims laid, 
<br />      While they (such power in Friendship lies) 
<br />Are Altars, Priests, and Off’rings made : 
<br />      And each Heart which thus kindly dies, 
<br />      Grows deathless by the Sacrifice.

<br /><br />Twenty-eight shotgun pellets 
<br />crater my thighs, belly and groin. 
<br />I gently thumb each burnt bead, 
<br />fingering scabbed stubs with ointment. 
<br /><br />Could have neutered me, made extinct 
<br />the volatile, romantic man I am. 
<br />“He’s dead,” 
<br />doctor at emergency room 
<br />could’ve easily told my wife that night. 
<br />Instead, “Soak him in a bath twice a day. Apply 
<br />this ointment to the sores. Here’s a month’s supply 
<br />of pain killers.” I remember the deep guttural groan 
<br />I gave, when the doctor pressed my groin. 
<br />Assured 
<br />I could still make love, morphine drowsed me 
<br />and in a dull stupor I don’t remember 
<br />police visiting my bed, or laughing so hard, 
<br />they scowled for a serious answer. 
<br />I howled a U.F.O. shot me along the Río Grande, 
<br />and they cursed and left. 
<br /><br />In the summer of ’88 
<br />I’d traded alfalfa for a bull calf. 
<br />Still smelling of milk udders, 
<br />I tied it to the truck rack and drove off. 
<br />Its hooves teethed 
<br />at pink roots 
<br />’til the whole lush field went bare dirt. 
<br />A magnificent bull. 
<br />Glowing wheel of heart 
<br />breathed brimming stream of white flame at dawn. 
<br />He wrangled his black brawn 
<br />like a battleshield to challenge the sun, 
<br />reared thick neck down and sideways, 
<br />lunged at me with dart and snort, 
<br />hoof-stamped and nostrilled dirt, 
<br />’til I growled him back 
<br />whipping air 
<br />with a limber willow branch, 
<br />poured grain in trough 
<br />and spread alfalfa. 
<br />I respected his horns 
<br />and he the whistling 
<br />menace of willow. 
<br /><br />One afternoon my cousin Patricio 
<br />helped me band the bull’s scrotum, 
<br />usurp swollen sap 
<br />in his testicle sack. It withered 
<br />to a pink wattle and seeded 
<br />the garden to drive cornstalks 
<br />to bear hardy, golden horns. 
<br /><br />Thereafter, he grazed the fenceline, 
<br />with the tempered lust and peaceful grace 
<br />of a celibate priest. 
<br />His bearing now arranged itself 
<br />elegant as a wild flower 
<br />sprung over night. 
<br />______________ 
<br /><br />Perfecto shot it. 
<br />Rasping on a black rope of blood 
<br />round its neck, it staggered, 
<br />bouldering convulsions. 
<br />Blood exploding 
<br />in bright lash of earthquaked air, 
<br />it stumble-butted stock trailer fender— 
<br />second and third shots glowed 
<br />its death. 
<br /><br />A quivering shadow of life-flame 
<br />darkened the air and it sputtered 
<br />a last drop of blood. 
<br />I drank long swigs 
<br />of whiskey and, thinking it was dead, 
<br />turned to walk away, 
<br />then 
<br />it gave a tremendous groan, tremendous groan, 
<br />a birth-letting groan . . . a moon groan . . . 
<br />blood spurted out, thick, thick, thick 
<br />alleys of dead star blood 
<br /><br />and I turned and said aloud to myself, 
<br />“That’s the moon’s voice! 
<br />That’s the moon’s voice!” 
<br /><br />And the white moon was in the sky, 
<br />and I looked at the moon for a long time. 
<br />______________ 
<br /><br />I sat on the ground 
<br />and gulped whiskey, drank the steer’s death 
<br />still warm in my throat. 
<br />A beautiful animal! I allowed to be butchered. 
<br />When it trounced and galloped in the field, 
<br />its body was a dark, windy cliff edge, 
<br />and its eyes were doorways of a dream— 
<br />now it bled a charred scroll 
<br />of ancient chant in gravel, I would never know, 
<br />and its blackened logs of blood 
<br />smoldered dying vowels, I would never hear. 
<br />My heart’s creak-n-tremble rage 
<br />milled the steer’s death to red grist, 
<br />I grieved, 
<br />I wept drunkenly 
<br />that no one cared, 
<br />that humankind betrayed him, 
<br />that we were all cowards. 
<br />______________ 
<br /><br />Perfecto, Valasquez and the butcher 
<br />tried to stop me 
<br />from driving, 
<br />but now was the time to settle 
<br />a bad feud with another friend. 
<br />Redeem the bull’s blood with ours. 
<br />I drove to Felipe’s house, 
<br />anger knotted in me 
<br />tight as the rope tied 
<br />to the stock trailer 
<br />steer strained against. 
<br />I pulled, but could not free myself. 
<br />(I had a dream night before— 
<br />I crossed black-iron footbridge, 
<br />partially collapsed by sea storm. 
<br />Left-hand railing swept out to sea, 
<br />I gripped bolt-studded right-hand railing, 
<br />finger-clutched wire netting sides, 
<br />carefully descended waist-high water. Waded 
<br />through slowly and ascended other side— 
<br />but had lost my sunglasses and wallet, 
<br />went back, groped bottom, found them and ascended again.) 
<br /><br />Had to cross that bridge again. 
<br />Full of significance . . . tonight, 
<br />deepest part of flooded bridge was danger . . . drowning . . . 
<br />represented years of my life collapsed 
<br />and destroyed, water the cleansing element, 
<br />my ascent from had healed, onto firm ground, 
<br />but I went back, to re-live 
<br />destruction… 
<br />“Felipe!” I yelled, porch light 
<br />flicked on, illuminating the yard. 
<br />“Came to fight,” I said, “take off 
<br />your glasses.” 
<br /><br />Bug-eyes glazed 
<br />bewildered, then gray slits of lips 
<br />snarled, “You motherless dog!” 
<br />He withdrew in darkness a moment, 
<br />reappeared on porch, serrated saw of his voice 
<br />cut the chill dark, 
<br />“¡Hijo de su pinche madre! 
<br />¡Mátalo! ¡Mátalo!!” 
<br /><br />First shot framed darkness round me 
<br />with a spillway of bright light, 
<br />eruption of sound, and second shot roared 
<br />a spray of brilliance and the third 
<br />gave an expanded halo-flash. 
<br />My legs woozed, and then 
<br />I buckled to the ground. 
<br />(I thought, holy shit, what ever happened 
<br />to the old yard-style fight between estranged friends!) 
<br /><br />I groaned with the steer, 
<br />and crawled my dead legs 
<br />to the truck, lunged on elbows into the cab, 
<br />hand lifting the dead stone beneath my waist 
<br />to clutch and brake. 
<br /><br />Following morning calls came, 
<br />“Tell us who did it Gato!” 
<br />“Our rifles are loaded!” 
<br />I said, “Leave it alone. What would you do 
<br />if a drunk man came into your yard, 
<br />threatened to beat you?” 
<br />I wanted peace, 
<br />wanted to diffuse the immovable core 
<br />of vengeance in my heart, 
<br />I had carried since a child, 
<br />dismantle the bloody wheel of violence 
<br />I had ridden since a child. 
<br /><br />During my week in bed, 
<br />pellets pollinated me 
<br />with a forgotten peace, 
<br />and between waking thoughts of anger and vengeance, 
<br />sleep was a small meadow of light, 
<br />a clearing I walked into and rested. Fragrance of peace 
<br />filled me as fragrance 
<br />of flowers and dirt permeate hands 
<br />that work in the garden all day. 
<br /><br />Curandero came to visit, and said, 
<br />“The bull in ancient times was the symbol of females. 
<br />Did you know that? Killing the bull, 
<br />is killing the intuitive part of yourself, 
<br />the feminine part. Did you realize, 
<br />when Jesus was raising Lazarus, 
<br />he groaned in his spirit and that bull groaned, 
<br />and when you killed the bull, it was raising you. 
<br />The dying bull gave birth to you and now you are either 
<br />blessed or cursed. The flood of that bull’s blood, 
<br />is either going to drown you or liberate you, 
<br />but it will not be wasted.”
