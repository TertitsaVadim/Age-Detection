Since then, I paid taxes only on my income net of my 401K contribution.  The 401K plan was intended to be a retirement fund.   If I were to save my contributions in the bank, the interest that my money would earn would range from .02% to 2% per annum.   The interest earnings would vary depending on whether I deposit the funds into a savings account or make a time deposit as well as how large the deposit is. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcXVpZG9vLmNvbS93aGF0LW15LTQwMWstcGxhbi1tZWFucy1mb3ItbXktcmV0aXJlbWVudA__" target="_blank">My 401k</a> funds, on the other hand, would be pooled with other employees’ funds into a mutual fund and administered by the company.  As fund administrator, the company invests the mutual fund in stocks, bonds or similar instruments that generates higher yield in terms of interest or dividends income.  I had a choice on where my 401K contributions will be invested.  It is evident that the 401K retirement plan is the better option in planning for retirement. <br /><br />However, I had the opportunity being offered by another company a better prospect: better pay, better benefits, better working hours and the like.  I was faced with dilemma of what to do with <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi9teS00MDFrLw__" target="_blank">My 401k</a> account.   I could take my money from the company’s account and use it any way I please.   But since I had not yet reached 59 ½, the prescribed age for normal distribution, I could be taxed by the IRS with taxes on all of the money and apply an additional 10% penalty or excise tax for early due to untimely distribution.   I was left with the option to do a rollover of my 401K account. <br /><br />How do I roll over my 401K funds?   In roll over, I have two choices.   I can either rollover my funds into my new employer’s 401K account or rollover into an IRA or Individual Retirement Account.   The IRA account is similar to the regular 401K account but the funds are managed by a broker or another company.  <br /><br />Before answering the question “How do I roll over my 401K funds?” make sure to determine your eligibility for roll over.   Only employees who are terminated may withdraw their funds before they reach the prescribed age and roll over their 401K funds.  This was my case when I terminated my employment with the company.  I avoided being penalized for early distribution by opting to roll over my 401K funds into a Roth IRA account. The account was named after Senator William V. Roth, Jr. after he introduced the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.   The Roth IRA account allows me to make larger contributions into my fund and to make withdrawals that are usually tax-free.   One such instance is if I withdraw my rolled over fund after 5 years following roll over.   However, restrictions on distributions before the prescribed age in the 401K plan similarly apply in the Roth IRA account.  But unlike the 401K Plan, the Roth IRA allows for a catch-up contribution for those over 50 years old. <br /><br />In the process of planning for retirement, I weighed all options and came up with the idea that the IRA suited me better for me to achieve my goals for retirement.  In the process of planning for yours, be sure to weigh your options to find arrangements that best suit your needs.

None of us has the ability to see into the future. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0LzQwMWstcmV0aXJlbWVudC9zYXZpbmctZm9yLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv" target="_blank">Saving for retirement</a> is one of the ways to ensure financial security in the future. The funds you will accumulate in your retirement account will decide the sort of lifestyle you will be able to afford when you retire. Nobody wants to have to work during retirement just to pay for bills or to settle debts.<br /><br />A Plan for Everyone<br /><br />There is a multitude of available options to assist people in saving for retirement. There are traditional pension plans and Individual Retirement Arrangements. There are also employer based plans like the 401k and the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE IRA). There is a plan for each person depending on their needs and financial situations.<br /><br />Decide Your Future<br /><br />Before you start <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcXVpZG9vLmNvbS9hLWZldy1yZW1pbmRlcnMtYmVmb3JlLXNhdmluZy1mb3ItcmV0aXJlbWVudA__" target="_blank">Saving for retirement</a> you should first visualize what you want your life to be in the future. Would you like a view of serene waves lapping sandy beaches? Would you instead like a nice little place out in the peaceful countryside? I am sure you would not want to live out retirement on some basic apartment complex and having to deal with noisy neighbours and other annoyances. <br /><br />If you think about it, most people will spend most of their lives in school and then at work. Normally, when people retire they also see it as an opportunity to finally do some of the things they were not able to do before due to studies or work. Maybe experience an African trek. Or maybe a Caribbean holiday. A cruise around the Mediterranean is certainly something you would want to do at least once in your life. <br /><br />Look at all Your Options<br /><br />Once you are done with envisioning the future you want to have then it is time to choose the retirement plan that can give you that future. You should think about how much money you will eventually need. To maintain their current standard of living, the majority of Americans will need an equivalent of about 70% of pre retirement income during retirement. However, those Americans who plan to have an extravagant lifestyle during retirement will need roughly 100% or more of their pre retirement income when they retire. When saving for retirement, what you want is a retirement plan that can provide for all your needs during retirement. There are tools like a retirement calculator than can assist you in managing your finances regarding your retirement fund.<br /><br />Cover All the Bases<br />Finally, once you have narrowed down your options, make sure you know every little bit of information you need to know. Will my 401k plan be able to give me all I need during retirement? How are self directed retirement plans different from the other typical retirement options? What kinds of investment opportunities should I divert my retirement funds to? Should I put in contributions based on the retirement calculators’ results?

And more employees nowadays are investing for their retirement in 401k plans. 401k makes it easier for employees to save for retirement by automatically deducting a part of their salary.

Many saving/investment options for the 401k saving plan are presented to the employees. Among all investment choices, the bond mutual funds, money market resources, stock mutual funds and stable value accounts are  most common choices of cconsumers. The stable value accounts and money market resources are the safest investments. The stable value accounts and money market resources produce low profits even though they are the safest investments. If compared to stocks, bond mutual funds generate less profits but greater profits than stable value accounts and money market resources. Bond mutual funds have less exposure to the chance of losing profits. Although stock mutual funds can generate high profits, it can be very unpredictable. 401k administrators will increase as more employers use 401k. It is very obvious that having to handle taxes is very mind-numbing. Hiring a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi80MDFrLXBsYW4tYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvci8_" target="_blank">401k plan administrator</a> can be a great help manage your 401k.<br /><br />401k administrators can be of assistance when it comes to making sure of the deliverance of benefits and services are given.

Like so many in my age group, I have started to think about retirement and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi8_" target="_blank">My 401k plan</a>.  I was automatically signed up with my company’s 401K plan when I started working with them in the early 1980’s.  So you ask me, “What is 401K plan?” <br /><br />My understanding is the 401K plan is a retirement savings plan for employees.  The contributions I make to build my 401K plan are matched with an equal amount by my employer.   The company acts as the 401K plan administrator who invests the money into stocks, bonds, the money market or a mix of any of these.  Choosing where his money is invested rests on the employee.  For my part I opted to invest my savings in stocks and bonds. <br /><br />What is 401K plan and how does it affect my taxes?  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub2wuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9rL2Fub255bW91cy9yZXRpcmVtZW50LWFuZC1teS00MDFrLXBsYW4vM2NhNWhjMnBoYmxoZy84Iw__" target="_blank">My 401K plan</a> allows me to pay taxes only on my take-home pay net of my 401K contributions.  Upon retirement after the age of 59-1/2 and I decide to make distributions from my fund which includes interest and dividend earnings, the distributions are taxed only as regular income.   It is in this manner that my 401K plan becomes a tax shield.  However, if distributions are made before I reach the prescribed age, I am penalized with excise taxes amounting to 10% of the amount.   The penalty is over and above the regular income tax imposed and computed on the year the distribution was made. <br /><br />If I want to avoid additional taxes my 401K plan allows me to take out a loan on my savings which I may repay in equal amounts over a period of not more than 5 years plus reasonable interest payments.  I can pay back the loan for the purchasing my principal residence can be repaid for more than 5 years.  If I fail to pay my loan amortizations on time, my loan will be considered “in default”.   Subsequently, the balance of my loan becomes due and demandable, is treated as a regular distribution and therefore imposed the excise tax.<br /><br />What is the consequence of becoming disabled or I die before I reach the age of 59-1/2?   In the event that I become totally and permanently disabled, if I die or am terminated after the age 55 but before reaching the prescribed age, my 401K plan will allow me to close my plan with the company without being penalized.    If I am terminated after I reach the age of 55 and since my 401K plan amounts to more than $1,000, I can close my account but will have to invest the funds into another similar retirement plan.  Failing to do so before 6 months, I will be taxed like I made a regular distribution. <br /><br />My 401K plan also allows for distributions intended for my financial needs that are immediate and require large amounts.   These are known as hardship distributions.   Hardship distribution considers needs for medical expenses or that of my dependent family members.  Other instances that may be considered are for the purchase of, repair or amortization of my principal dwelling, tuition fees or funeral expenses.<br /><br />I have the intention of retiring from the work force when I reach the age of 60 and go into business.  I expect to be able to benefit from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi8_" target="_blank">My 401k plan</a> distributions by that time.  I have decided on a lump sum distribution over instalment payments.   And this is the way my 401K retirement plan ensures a worry-free retirement.

		<document id="dffe296e418d6d037658ad973de09ab2" url=""><![CDATA[Your Retirement Plan and Income for Retirement<br/><br/>American employees who started saving for retirement in the 1980’s with the 401K plan are either approaching or in their retirement age.   They now ask the question; how much money is needed to retire.  The response to the question is simple: their income for retirement should match the lifestyle they want to maintain.  At the age of 59 ½ they could start making distributions from their 401K retirement plan.  Senate enacted the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 or the ERTA allowed employees to contribute to the Individual Retirement Account or IRA on top of their traditional retirement plan coverage.  IRA contributions had a ceiling of $1,500 in 1975 to $5,000 in 2010.  Further, in 2002 employees over 50 years old were allowed to make the so-called “Catch-up Contributions” or additional contributions to their IRA fund to help increase their expected <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi9pbmNvbWUtZm9yLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv" target="_blank">Income for retirement</a>. <br /><br />Computing for disposable <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub2wuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9rL2Fub255bW91cy90aGUtZHJlYW0tb2YtaGF2aW5nLWEtZ2VuZXJvdXMtaW5jb21lLzNjYTVoYzJwaGJsaGcvMTAj" target="_blank">Income for retirement</a> means considering contributions made to the 401K and/or to the IRA fund plus income from the investments of these same funds.   Similar to the 401K fund, the IRA funds are invested in stocks, bonds or the money market or a combination of these. Depending on how well placed the funds are, the earnings could be a considerable amount.   One should remember to factor in the taxes that have to be paid for distributions.    The taxes on regular income are imposed on the distribution on the year the distributions are made even if the distribution includes earning derived from investing the funds.   Distributions made before reaching the prescribed age or premature distributions are imposed a penalty of 10 %.  This could considerably affect the expected income for retirement.  <br /><br />Before April 1 after reaching the age of 70 ½, minimum distributions must have been made.  Failing to comply with this provision would result in a penalty amounting to 50% of the amount that should have been distributed will be imposed.  The penalty would decrease the amount of income for retirement that the retiree, making it far from what he expected.   The minimum distribution is set in a table provided by the IRS that is based on life expectancy of the retiree or his beneficiary in case the retiree is deceased.   Distributions can be made in lump sum or in instalments depending on the requirements of the account holder.   <br /><br />At times, the retiree opts for lump sum distribution in order to increase his <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L215LTQwMWstcGxhbi9pbmNvbWUtZm9yLXJldGlyZW1lbnQv" target="_blank">Income for retirement</a> by investing the fund in a business enterprise.   Those who take this option are those who are inclined to go into business and are still willing and able to work.  It is not an option for those who intend to take it easy after retirement because going into business requires as much or even more hard work than being employed.  <br /><br />All of these factors affect the determination of how much money is needed to retire.   in order to avoid being penalized with excise taxes I rolled over my 401K fund into an IRA account when I changed employers.  I also made catch-up contributions after turning 51 years of age, in order to support my goal of travelling the world when I retire.

It can be a cause  of anxiety for them especially as they approach their senior years.  Therefore, retirement plans were designed for the self-employed and small businesses owners with no employees.   These retirement plans consist of the SEP IRAs and the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L3NvbG8tNDAxay8_" target="_blank">Solo 401k</a> otherwise known as the Solo K or Uni-K.  In the case of small business establishments with no employees, the spouse can also contribute to the Solo 401K as long as he derives income from the business. <br /><br />The Solo 401K for the self-employed, like the IRAs, has two versions, the traditional and the Roth.   These versions work just like the same principles that govern the IRA.   For the traditional Solo 401K, the tax benefits are realized when you make your contributions.   However, you will be taxed when you make withdrawals.   The Roth version allows for the tax benefits to be realized upon retirement but not during contribution. One can choose to contribute to both versions of the Solo 401k for self employed individuals. <br /><br />The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub2wuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9rL2Fub255bW91cy9ob3ctdGhlLXNvbG8tNDAxay13b3Jrcy8zY2E1aGMycGhibGhnLzEyIw__" target="_blank">Solo 401K</a> allows the plan holder to save for a higher value account compared to other retirement plans.   It allows you to contribute not only the employee’s share but also the employer’s as well.  The employer’s share amounts to 25% of the employee’s share. The contributions have no fixed rate so that you can save more when there is more income and less when there is less. <br /><br />Just like the IRAs, the Solo 401K plan stipulates that the money has to be invested up to the time you are 59 ½.   Withdrawals made prior to the retirement age would mean the imposition of a 10% taxes aside from the income tax when you make the withdrawal.   Nonetheless, there are exceptions where one can withdraw from the funds before the prescribed age without being penalized.  These situations include the purchase of the plan holders’ first principal residence and expenses for higher education.  A hardship withdrawal is also permitted without being penalized including the case of expenses for large medical bills or the permanent disability of the plan holder. <br /><br />The option to take out a loan on the account is open if the reason for the withdrawal does not fall under the abovementioned reasons.  In this manner, you can avoid the tax penalty.   Using your Solo 401K account as collateral, you may borrow up to 50% of the total value of the account but not to exceed $50,000.<br /><br />The Solo 401K for the self-employed indicates that you invest the money into financial instruments such as stocks and bonds for it to increase in value in time for your retirement.  If you are not well versed in this area, it would be a good idea to get 401K advice from experts.   These financial experts can provide inputs not only on the investment aspect of the retirement funds but also on the type of Solo 401K you would contribute to because of tax issues.   The higher your income is the higher your tax bracket is going to be.   Similarly, the basis for taxation of a higher bracket is also higher.   Hence, experts can likewise advise you on the choice between the traditional or Roth  or on the right combination of both.

		<document id="db63f4428a33cc0f65b4c76828ba2ced" url=""><![CDATA[What is A Roth IRA Plan?<br/><br/>When the ERISA was introduced in 1974, it included the Individual Retirement Account or IRA.  It allowed for bigger contributions into the employees’ retirement fund.  This provision improved those of the 401K.  The IRA retained the conditions of the 401K to allow for tax-free contributions.  Originally, the IRA was open only for workers that did not have employment-based retirement coverage.  In 1981 this provision was amended to allow all taxpayers below the age of 70 ½ to have an IRA even if they already owned a retirement plan.  The new provision likewise allowed plan holders to contribute in behalf of their non-working spouse.   In addition, a “Catch-up Plan” was implemented to allow plan holders over the age of 50 years to make additional contributions.  There are different types of IRA.   WE have the Traditional IRA, the Roth IRA, and the SEP IRA. <br /><br />Perhaps one might ask: “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzQwMWtyb2xsb3ZlcmhlbHAubmV0L3JvdGgtaXJhL3doYXQtaXMtYS1yb3RoLWlyYS8_" target="_blank">What is a Roth IRA</a>?” and “How does it differ from the other IRAs?”  These questions are normally asked when considering the idea of retirement.   Responding to the question “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tub2wuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9rL2Fub255bW91cy9hLXJlYWN0aW9uLXRvLXdoYXQtaXMtYS1yb3RoLWlyYS1wbGFuLzNjYTVoYzJwaGJsaGcvMTEj" target="_blank">What is a Roth IRA</a> Plan?” it allows the plan holder to withdraw funds from the Roth IRA tax-free.  The contributions one makes to the Roth IRA, however, have no effect on the income taxes that one has to pay.  Answering the latter question, the traditional IRA allows for the exemption of taxes on the contributions one makes to the fund while the SEP IRA is open for owners of small businesses or self-employed individuals. The SEP IRA differs from the Traditional IRA by way of the fund being in the name of the plan holder rather than in the company’s name. <br /><br />And that is not all that answers the question “What is a Roth IRA Plan?”  The Roth IRA was institutionalized in 1997 when the Tax Relief Act was passed into law.  It took its name after the main author of the bill, Senator William Roth.  The main difference from other retirement plans is the tax-free nature of its withdrawals upon retirement but the contributions are not tax exempt.  The retirement age, not less than 59 ½ years old, is the same as in other plans. In other words, it is a choice between paying taxes now or later.  <br /><br />In recent years the Roth IRA has risen in popularity causing people to ask “What is a Roth IRA?”  Besides the advantages of the benefits of the Roth IRA over other retirement plans as discussed above, it has fewer restrictions on the kinds of investments the funds can be put into such as certificates of deposit and even real estate.<br /><br />In the event that that has not answer the question “ Plan?” then perhaps this will.   Withdrawing contributions made to the Roth IRA at any time does not make you liable to pay taxes.  The withdrawal of converted funds into the Roth IRA is also tax-free so long as the plan holder is at least 59 ½ years old and the funds have been in the account for at least 5 years.   The exemption to this rule applies when a plan holder withdraws for the purchase of his first principal residence.   The same exceptions to the rules on qualified distributions before reaching retirement age as in other retirement plans apply.  Among these exemptions include withdrawals for expenses to defray cost of medical expenses and higher education.   Then what is a Roth IRA in terms of maximum age limit? The Roth IRA can be maintained even past the age of 70 ½ years and passed on to a beneficiary after the death of the plan holder.   <br /><br />Self-employed individuals or owners of small businesses asking the question “What is Roth IRA?” it would be better to explore either the Solo 401K or the SEP IRA.  These accounts are appropriate for such individuals.
