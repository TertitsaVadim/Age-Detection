<br /><br />Working Out
<br /><br />The average nicotine craving lasts about three minutes. While those three minutes might feel like three years, you simply can’t light up if you’re busy exercising. Working out or exercising is one of the ways to avoid the craving of smoking. Go for a jog or find any sport that interests you. Thus by exercising not only will the craving pass, you’ll be developing new muscles.
<br /><br />Chew Gum
<br /><br />Chewing Gum is one of the other ways to fight the urge of smoking. This will not only in enjoying oral stimulation with both smoking and chewing gum, you can freshen your breath, feeling fresh. Keep in mind a dollar one or two is much cheaper than a pack of cigarettes.
<br /><br />Drink Water
<br /><br />Another method to stop smoking is to drink a lot of water. By keeping yourself hydrated you can successfully terminate the smoking habit. But people often accidentally flood their system with caffeine instead. If you are under the assumption that increasing the intake of caffeine will help, you cut down the craving for nicotine then think again. Quitting smoking actually reduces the amount of coffee you need to drink each day by half – instead of that second coffee, drink from a water bottle. This way one can, not only cut cost on cigarette packets but also on latte expenses.
<br /><br />Breathing Exercise
<br /><br />A smoker is used to limited breathing capabilities, to the point that he doesn’t realize his lungs do not function as well as a non-smoker’s. When a craving comes, take a deep breath. Feel your lungs expand and know that they are working better each day than they did the day before.
<br /><br />Go to Sleep
<br /><br />If you are a night owl, consider adjusting your schedule so that you can go to sleep an hour earlier than normal because It is difficult to overcome late night smoking cravings. By doing this, not only will you be less likely to get out of bed to smoke, you will also be giving your body sufficient rest while it experiences the process of withdrawal.
<br /><br />Keep in mind it is never late ever. There may be instance you may fail, but never give up. Some people have tried to quit smoking as many as eight times before they even succeeded.

<br />When the temperature changes, so should your beauty routine. Your hair and skin react differently to cooler climates, so you need to redefine your regimen to get the results you want to see.
<br /><br />If you want to adapt when the weather gets colder, take note of these Fall and Winter beauty tips to keep your skin and hair looking beautiful.
<br /><br />Winter Skin Care
<br />Cold weather means indoor heating which will have an adverse affect on your skin. To combat the drying affects, switch to a heavier moisturizing cream to add much-needed hydration. Lock in moisture by doing this while your face is still wet.
<br /><br />Avoid baths and showers that are too hot, and cool the water before you get out. Your skin will retain more moisture this way and you won’t go through the temperature shock so much when you get out. Rub in body lotion on your arms and legs and feet, particularly on your elbows and knees.
<br /><br />Use eye cream at night to combat dryness. If you do this on a regular basis, you’ll probably notice a reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. Get your beauty sleep to lower stress and put your best face forward.

Alternatively it can be used to add colour and character to a bar, restaurant, or virtually any other business or commercial property. Canvas art is essentially a reproduction of an original piece of art that is then printed on to high quality canvas. The canvas itself can help to make the art attractive because its natural rough quality gives the picture a texture that seems almost three dimensional.
<br /><br />Different Styles And Types
<br />There are a great many different types of abstract and pop art canvas art almost entirely because of how difficult it is to categorise such works of art. One thing is for sure, though, abstract and pop art have gained in popularity as well as infamy in some cases. While they tend to include the liberal use of bold colours, there are also pieces made entirely of black and white and while some may be politically motivated in their message others may be more socially aware or may even be based on modern culture.
<br /><br />Andy Warhol
<br /><br />Andy Warhol is among the best known pop artists and it was he that really introduced the concept of pop art canvas art. By taking pictures of celebrities and adding colour washes to create unique gallery style pictures he not only made a name for himself but started a generation of artists heading down the pop art and street art route. Warhol was popular with the younger generation because of his use of colour and his representation of popular celebrities but these were only a portion of the work that he did.
<br />Celebrity
<br /><br />Celebrities are still a popular topic for the street artist and the pop artist. It is not unusual to see a celebrity included in a colourful display that is designed to spark emotion and create a reaction.
<br /><br />Flexible Designs
<br /><br />The greatest thing about abstract and pop art canvas art, though, is how flexible it is. Whatever your preferences and whether you’re looking for the specific use of colours or even a favourite celebrity you will find them in pop art and abstract culture.

<br />    * Exercise can actually work wonders for your hair. It improves blood circulation, thereby benefiting your scalp with a crown full of silky flowing hair. So, go down that treadmill and have lustrous hair.
<br />    * Dandruff can be an annoying and often embarrassing condition, which also causes damage to your hair. Eating a balanced diet; cutting down on fried food, sugar, dairy products and junks; and washing your hair regularly can cut down on your dandruff problem.
<br />    * It’s absolutely necessary to choose the right kind of shampoo for your hair. You can use an experts help to pick your shampoo. Identify your hair type and pick one accordingly. Also overshampooing your hair can cause serious damage, so keep it limited to 2-3 washes in a week. Invest in a good conditioner to battle post-shampoo hair woes.
<br />    * Stress can lead to hair fall and thin, frayed strands. Studies show that hair actually grows slower when you are stressed. Your hair needs a good night’s sleep. So chill out and keep you eyes shut, for healthy locks.

But, there is the problem : Cookies have high calories and fat. Here we’d recommend 5 tips for Baking Healthier Cooking.
<br /><br />1. Make them more heart healthy.
<br /><br />* Swap out some of the butter, margarine or shortening for heart-healthy oils, such as canola oil or olive oil or pureed fruit or even vegetables.
<br /><br />* To replace fats with oil: For every tablespoon of butter you replace with heart-healthy oil, you eliminate at least 5 grams of saturated fat from your batch of cookies.
<br /><br />* Please remember that when you reduce the butter in a recipe you may lose some of its tenderizing and moisture-retaining properties. Cookies that use some oil in place of butter may be a bit crisper and may dry out sooner. To preserve the best cookie texture, be sure to store extra cookies in an airtight container.
<br /><br />* Try using pureed fruit or even vegetables in place of some of the butter, margarine or shortening. Options include applesauce, pear butter, prune puree or even pureed pumpkin. Using a fruit fat-replacer will give you a cakier, chewier or softer texture, so it works well in cookies that are naturally softer, such as oatmeal cookies or ginger molasses cookies.
<br /><br />2. : Replace unhealthy fats.
<br /><br />Consider replacing some of the butter with nontraditional cookie ingredients, such as nonfat plain yogurt, nonfat buttermilk or even fruit juice.
<br /><br />When you reduce overall fat in a cookie recipe, the resulting cookies can be dry; adding a “moist” ingredient helps keep the cookies satisfying. Try 1 to 4 tablespoons of a liquid ingredient in place of up to 4 tablespoons butter.
<br /><br />3. Add fiber to your cookies.
<br /><br />Try replacing some (or all) of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat pastry flour and/or oats. Using whole-wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour gives your cookies about four times the amount of fiber in every batch.
<br /><br />Or you can try replacing 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole rolled oats or oats that have been ground into a “flour.” Ground flaxseeds or flaxmeal can help add fiber to baked goods.
<br /><br />4: Keep sodium in check
<br /><br />Some baked goods can be surprisingly high in sodium. Aim for no more than 1/2 teaspoon salt per batch of cookies. If you’re on a salt-restricted diet, try reducing the salt in a batch of cookies to 1/4 teaspoon.
<br /><br />5: Eliminate trans fat &amp; other artificial ingredients
<br /><br />Steer clear of ingredients that contain partially hydrogenated oil (or trans fats), such as margarine and most vegetable shortenings. Consider limiting other artificial ingredients, such as artificial food dyes.
<br /><br />Small secrets for healthy ingredients:
<br /><br />* Adding an extra egg white gives crunch to a low-fat cookie. In recipes that call for several eggs, substitute two egg whites for one of the eggs if you are concerned about cholesterol.
<br /><br />* A little corn syrup will produce a browner cookie with a crisp surface and soft interior. Substitute the corn syrup for the same amount of sugar called for in the recipe.
<br /><br />* Use cocoa instead of melted or grated chocolate to help reduce fat. Three tablespoons cocoa plus 1 tablespoon water or other liquid equals 1 square or 1 ounce of melted baking chocolate. Mix the cocoa with the dry ingredients and the liquid with the wet or creamed ingredients.
<br /><br />* Overbaking will result in dry hard cookies. Most low-fat cookies should be removed from the oven while they’re still soft and just lightly browned around the edges. Low-fat cookies taste best when eaten within a few hours of baking.
<br /><br />It’s good to start baking the cookies with the new, healthy recipe in the small amount as for experiment. Until you have your own nutritious and delicious cookies recipe that you love. Enjoy baking and have healthy life!

It is caused by exposure to allergens, irritants or toxins. The symptoms include redness and itching. Painful rashes or raised bumps resembling pimples may appear. There are several things you can do to treat the condition and avoid problems like it in the future.
<br /><br />A Treatment Plan
<br /><br />Unless other portions of the face are affected, you can assume that the causative allergens, irritants or toxins are present in something you use on your eyelids. Cosmetics (eye makeup) are the likely culprits.
<br /><br />No woman wants to give up wearing makeup. You can try using hypoallergenic makeup, but they are not necessarily free of allergens. The term hypoallergenic has no legal definition. The same is true of the terms “dermatologist tested” and “doctor approved”.
<br /><br />You will need to look for makeup that is free of artificial preservatives and added fragrances. Natural mineral based pigments and powders are the least likely to cause irritation. You should avoid talc, but powdery makeup is less likely to cause problems than liquids.
<br /><br />It is a good idea to make sure that your other skincare products are free of common allergens, irritants and toxins. If you have eyelid contact dermatitis, other areas of your skin may be affected in the future.
<br /><br />To treat and relieve the symptoms, you need a nourishing eye serum. One that contains natural anti-inflammatories and antibacterial agents.
<br /><br />To summarize the plan:
<br /><br />* Avoid cosmetics and skincare products containing allergens, irritants of toxins
<br />    * Use the recommended eye serum referred to in the resource box below.
<br /><br />It’s that simple.
<br /><br />What are the Benefits of the Eye Serum?
<br /><br />The eye serum relieves the symptoms of eyelid contact dermatitis, reduces the risk of future outbreaks and provides other benefits. You will see or feel these things.
<br /><br />* Reduced redness
<br />    * Reduced itching
<br />    * Less swelling
<br /><br />All because of the anti-inflammatory activity of an ingredient called Functional Keratin. Because the serum also includes HALOXYL and EYELISS, you will also see these benefits.
<br /><br />* Less puffiness
<br />    * Reduction in dark circles
<br />    * No more bags under the eyes with continued use
<br /><br />The “continued use” part is important. The relief of eyelid contact dermatitis will be nearly immediate. The serum is cool and soothing going on. It does not cause any burning or irritation.
<br /><br />The other benefits are not immediate. For example, studies indicate that it takes about two months of daily use to get rid of bags and dark circles.
<br /><br />Additional Recommendations
<br /><br />Allergies are caused by an over-reaction of the immune system. It sends out signals that cause inflammation, when there is no need for it.
<br /><br />Doctors have yet to completely understand what causes allergies. However some benefits have been seen with the use of nutritional supplements that support normal immune system function and balance the inflammatory response. I recommend Omega-3 DHA fish oil supplements.
<br /><br />With improved nutrient intake and the use of better skincare products, you might not have problems with eyelid contact dermatitis in the future.

With the rapid adoption of smart phones with broadband and 3G in the world, developers are building applications aimed at broadening communication of millions of users.
<br /><br />Some examples are: WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Tango, PingChat!, Fring, MSN, AIM, BeejiveIM, Facebook Chat and Google Talk.The interesting thing about these programs, which could modify the phones of tomorrow-perhaps already are, is that weight is not paid extra for use on telephone rates, however, most of them works only if you have a data plan.
<br /><br />The question: Can one day be eliminated traditional phone bills? Marketing Director said that users need to talk and stay connected all the time, so it is difficult to determine a cost avoidance, “although in future it could happen, for what we would see what kind of measures be taken”. Considers it a reality the potential of free messaging apps, which does not represent a threat to the operator.
<br /><br />“From the point of view of business is important to have these new platforms, especially as we sell data plans. To use these services, most require a plan on your cell phone, so I do not see it as a risk, rather we are concerned that the user is with us and have all the services required. ”
<br /><br />The one fact has been noticed in the company, he says, is that every day unless the users use SMS messaging service, due to applications such as WhatsApp, BlackBerry Messenger or Facebook chat. “This situation is favorable because there is a saving (…). The issue is that to the extent that the phones are more innovative and have more applications, requires activation of data. ”
<br /><br />Are young people who use more of these platforms, so that the voice becomes less important as communication address, said the representative of the company. In this sense, you can talk about a new form of interaction for the development of applications focused on communication? And is that the attractiveness of these tools is that they offer the possibility to make calls, send instant messages, send video and photo files, and more.
<br /><br />An analyst in Latin America, states that the future of communication is in the “socialization of content,” ie, sharing information through social networks. In the same way as in the past it was important that the cell count with a camera in the future will be essential to record video in high definition, and can be shared through social networks.
<br /><br />The apps have a very interesting future, are a new way to consume content, “will begin to see increased application usage of newspapers, magazines, e-books and radio programs; also be the option to customize the screen our smartphone content we consume more frequently, “he explains.
<br /><br />As the speed of data transmission, says it is optimal in large cities, as mobile operators have invested heavily in infrastructure to strengthen networks, particularly 3G. Between this year and next, companies will be investing in the deployment of 4G networks, he says. This will allow faster navigation and better user experience robust mobile applications such as video.
<br /><br />In this sense, the company’s service offering is the BlackBerry Messenger, in which the user can have unlimited messages at no cost, among other options. Thus, the tendency is to make all the necessary platform for users to be in constant communication. Remains to be seen whether operators and technology infrastructure in the country respond to 100% to meet this phenomenon.
<br /><br />Applications Tango Ideal for video calls and video from the iPhone anywhere in the world, although it is possible to communicate with terminal users who run with the operating system Android, Google. It can be used over 3G networks, and both a front camera as a rear camera.
<br /><br />The video quality is perhaps not the most optimal, but allows free video calls from anywhere, an advantage over similar services such as FaceTime, which for now works only for Wi-Fi connection.
<br /><br />Available for iPhone and Android Price: Free Skype software for making calls over Internet (VoIP). Its interface is very similar to other instant messaging programs such as Windows Live Messenger or Yahoo Messenger, so use the Wi-Fi to connect directly, regardless of the operator, and make calls free of charge.
<br /><br />The latest version adds the ability to talk over video. Devices that do not have camera (IPAD), only to receive the images, while those who have it may also be sent. Furthermore, in the case of the iPhone 4, may be sent to the front camera. Available for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, BlackBerry and Android Price: Free WhatsApp Messenger is a multiplatform messenger for Android, iPhone, Blackberry and Nokia, which uses 3G or Wi-Fi when a connection is available.
<br /><br />You can send and receive photos, videos, audio notes, messages and video messages. The app accesses the stored contact list and automatically detects which of them is using. Available for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Symbian Price: Free BlackBerry Messenger instant messaging service exclusively for mobile users of the brand.
<br /><br />Its design has chat style and no limitations on the amount of characters. Allows you to customize the status and image of the user, add people by scanning their bar codes or PINs to share, send photos, videos, voice memos and files with one or more contacts, create groups of friends, family or co-workers quickly share calendars , lists, discussions and updates, and see what they are listening to friends, and more.
<br /><br />Available for BlackBerry Price: Free, but only works to have a plan Viber Once SMS is activated, the program integrates with the agenda. Its appeal is that it allows free calls over the Internet to other people who also have installed on their devices, but necessarily need to have a 3G data plan.
<br /><br />In iPhone, whenever a contact download the application, there comes a warning message.
<br /><br />Available for iPhone, but this year is planned to come to Android and BlackBerry Price: Free BeejiveIM is an application similar to Windows Live, but with many more features: You can disable or delete a contact, and even customize the background of chat .
<br /><br />Easy to add more than one account, either Hotmail, MySpace, Facebook, Yahoo, Google Talk, among others, as well as opening several sessions at once, as it shows an organized interface. Works seamlessly with Multitask.
