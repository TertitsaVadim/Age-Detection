I have started several myself and successfully published them for years. Make no mistake, it is hard work, but if you can meet a few key requirements you can get your magazine off the ground.<br /><br />What are those few key requirements?<br /><br />1) You need some money to do this - Every business start up needs some capital and magazines are no different. How much do you need? As little as a few hundred dollars will work (not including your printing costs) to get your first issue on the streets and/or news stands. For a projected higher end book, you will need thousands of dollars dependent on what market you are entering and how big you are going right off the bat. The key will be to learn the skills you need to publish and do the tasks yourself rather than hire an office full of workers and payroll (I will hit on those skills in a minute and talk more about cash in a minute).<br /><br />2) Equipment - At least one good computer capable of operating the various software you will need (Adobe InDesign and at least Adobe Photoshop), a good digital SLR camera like the Nikon D50 which runs about $750, a phone and a dependable vehicle.<br /><br />3) The ability to sell - Magazines big and small run off of advertisements and yours will be no different. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a solid sales strategy in place before you take on this project. I will talk more about selling further along.<br /><br />4) Creativity - You can't survive without offering something new to your readers in an attractive package and for this being creative is a necessity.<br /><br />Step #1 - Develop the Framework<br /><br />You probably have an idea of what type of magazine you want to publish but from here you need to construct some basic framework. Pick a name for your magazine carefully, make sure you are not stepping on anyone's trademark by searching the US trademark database.<br /><br />Your website's domain name is also something to consider when choosing your name. Search for open domains that match your magazine's name as closely as possible. It is okay to use a few sudo-odd takes on domains for magazines like magazinenameonline.com or magazine-name.com. Register your domain and contact a web development company that you like to start work on your magazine's new website. I personally like 22 Creative as they specialize in websites for magazines. Your website does not need to be awesome right out of the gate, just something professional that is clear about who you are and what your book is about - expect to spend anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands here. A website is an essential part of this process though, do not skip out on this one.<br /><br />Okay, you have a name and a website, what's next? Figure out what you are going to include in your first issue by writing out an editorial outline. Fancy name but in reality, just write out what you want to feature, how many pages you want to devote to each item and how many pages for ads you want to stash away (this will be dependent on how many ads you sell for your first issue). How many pages should your magazine be? Two factors are in play here. One is the cost of printing the magazine as it costs more to print a bigger magazine obviously, the second is how much editorial can or do you want to produce? You do not need a 100 page book your first go around so, dependent on what your competitors are doing, aim for around 50 pages for a local or lifestyle magazine and 90+ for a magazine you want to distribute on national news stands.<br /><br />Step #2 - It's Time to Produce Content<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, you do not need an army of 'journalists' to publish your first issue. I have produced content for hundreds of magazines by myself or with the help of just a handful of people, it is not that hard.<br /><br />Start with item number one on your editorial outline. Write your text first, making sure to follow basic guidelines for writing editorial (Google search it for tons of help). Have friends read the copy and get their honest opinion. Did you lose your readers attention at any point? Are your facts correct? Do you have any typos?<br /><br />A picture is worth a thousand words literally. People like pictures, big, colorful pictures and lots of them. Decide on how many pictures you need for the piece and whether or not you can take the photos yourself or if you need to buy them/license them from a stock photo service. If you can take them yourself, head out and start snapping. Take clear, in-focus images and take lots of them. You do not want to have to go back and re-shoot anything because you did not get the shot. Also, set your camera to take 300dpi images, normal smaller resolution images will not work and will look pixilated in the final product - nothing comes off as more rookie than low-res photos in magazines. Remember if you have any people in your photos, get them to sign a 'model release' allowing you to use their image in your publication. If you need to buy an image from a stock photo website, make sure you buy a 300dpi image that is suitable for printing. Expect to pay anywhere from $3 - $10 for each photo, if you encounter a website that charges more, you would be over paying.<br /><br />After you have knocked your editorial out, sleep on it and go over it yourself. Is it good? How many magazines have you seen that all regurgitate the same tired 'electronics features' of iPhones and some silly whatever that not many people care about? Lots. You have to have a new take on things if you want to see issue number 2, 3, 54, etc.<br /><br />Step #3 - Start Selling Ads Yesterday<br /><br />New publishers often fall into the trap of just focusing on the creative side of the magazine and not the sales. As an independent publisher, you have to wear both hats. Start by putting together a media kit for your new magazine. A media kit is a couple pages, printed out that act as a resume for your magazine featuring all of the details of who your magazine is for, how many you print, your distribution tactics, what ads you offer and how much they cost, etc. In the beginning most of your sales will not be because of your media kit, this is just an essential thing to have to leave with prospective advertisers. I could go on and on about how to sell ads for new magazines but if you read it, you would have to send me a pretty big check as that is closely held information by all in the industry. What I can tell you is start with a plan; call on advertisers that make sense for your magazine. It is a waste of time to try and sell an ad to Budweiser if you are a new magazine that is about quilting - it's just not going to happen. Put yourself in that business owners shoes, would you consider it?<br /><br />Now is not the time to get rich quick. You want to sell ads to pay the bills and hopefully recoup your investment and live. That means price your ad offerings in reality. For an idea of what reality is, try and find out what similar magazines in your market are charging. Do not go to low on your pricing however, believe in the value of your magazine - giving it away free almost guarantees future failure. I know of one magazine that just kept throwing money at itself, starting in new markets without first being profitable in one and to appear successful, they gave away their ad space. A couple years later and it is common knowledge in the media buying industry that no one pays for ads in that magazine ever. If a potential advertiser says they want it for less than you want to sell it for, pass on them politely and come back to them in a few months after you can prove a stronger value to justify your rate card.<br /><br />Most importantly, offer value to your advertisers. There are a gazillion different ways to do this but it all starts with you delivering a strong, readable publication on time. The old under-promise and over-deliver adage works well here.<br /><br />Step #4 - Layout Time<br /><br />It's crunch time. Layout is hardly ever pleasurable, my first issue I ever designed took me about 72 hours of work with about 6 hours of sleep in that period - not exactly what I call an awesome good time. Make sure you know how to use your software BEFORE you need to start laying out your pub. Pretty much the whole free world uses Adobe InDesign to layout their magazines. It is a reliable and easy to use program that will run you about $650 unless you can find a deal. You should seriously consider purchasing one of Adobe's Creative Suites that bundles InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator. Those three programs will take you anywhere you want to go in publishing as I have been relying on them for years. Yes that is some expensive software but is essential and well worth the money if you are serious about doing this right.<br /><br />If you flip through a random magazine here and there, you will notice that a lot of them have an inconsistent layout throughout the book, meaning that the fonts and styles change every few pages or every story. If this appeals to you knock yourself out, just know that it is not a good practice to follow. You need to aim for a balanced flow with your layouts. The first page of content should be very close to the last page and not stray too far in between. Use a text font at or above 8 points and never smaller. Don't forget those pictures, lots and lots of pictures. Learn to use Photoshop to clean your photos up. I have spent at least 60 seconds with every photo I have ever placed in a magazine layout - it is a crime to run photos with zero post work done on them, just a straight up crime.<br /><br />I won't go into an InDesign tutorial, plenty of people have done that better than I can before.<br /><br />What you need to ultimately do is end up with a PDF file for each page of your magazine that you will give to your printer. Name each file a standard p01_NAME.pdf. Covers will be labeled C1, C2, etc. You will have the option to view proofs of your files before your printer fires up the press to start your job (a big chunk of what you are paying them to do). Always look at every proof of every page; once it gets put on a plate and starts laying down ink, you are locked in.<br /><br />Make sure you are happy with your printer. If you do not have a printer to print your job, start by talking to Las Vegas Printing to get a quote on your job. I recommend getting your finished magazines carton packed rather than skid packed and wrapped in plastic as this practice guarantees a percentage of waste due to not protecting the magazines on the outside of the skid.<br /><br />Step #5 - Distribution Time<br /><br />If you are starting a magazine that will have National or a large ranging distribution, head straight to one of the two major magazine distributors. I won't name them because they, in my opinion, make it very difficult for start ups to get in the game. I will leave it at that. I found that this individual described this incredibly on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Felectronicdrumkitreview.com%2Ffree-online-games-girls%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://electronicdrumkitreview.com/free-online-games-girls/</a>  web post.<br /><br />If you are starting a locally distributed magazine, read on. Yes there are services that offer to distribute your magazine for you, they will do a poor job and charge you and arm and a leg for the privilege. Distribution is paramount. If no one sees, picks up or reads your magazine then it is just a waste of time, money and trees. A major part of your focus should be dialing in the best distribution strategy possible. Do not just toss magazines in front of stores, bars, etc. and expect them to take the time to place them out in a neat fashion - they will end up in the dumpster out back. Do your own distribution. Personally ask permission from each distribution spot, not only is this the right thing to do but it is a great way to get your name out there and meet a few potential advertisers.<br /><br />Step #6 - Do it again, and again and again<br /><br />The process never stops in the magazine game, it is a fight at all times. There will always be strong competition, new people looking for their share of a market and times where you feel like you are the only person that reads your magazine. But if you do not fight at all, it's a guarantee that you will not win. Good luck!

They're charming, intelligent animals, and there is a lot of appeal in having a &quot;special&quot; animal that not many people have. While foxes can make decent pets for someone with the time and resources to care for them, a lot of people make the mistake of buying a pet fox thinking it is going to be just like a dog.<br /><br />1. Foxes Are Difficult to Train<br /><br />Dogs are born with a very strong pack mentality. A dog sees you as its alpha, and is hard-wired to want to obey the leader. They live to please you. A fox, however, lives to please itself. While they are very intelligent, the core motivation of a fox is different than that of a dog. The dog wants to please you and make you happy, the fox wants the treat. I found that this site showed this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdslrcamerareviewer.com%2Fsony-dslr-a200k-good%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dslrcamerareviewer.com/sony-dslr-a200k-good/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />2. Foxes Stink<br /><br />Foxes have a very strong odor. While a dog can take a few weeks without a bath to work up a powerful stink, foxes smell skunky 24/7. This strong, musky odor can be lessened somewhat by having the fox neutered, but it cannot be eliminated entirely.<br /><br />3. Foxes Are Shy<br /><br />Many people picture a fox as an awesome pet that they can show off to their friends and neighbors. Unfortunately, the reality almost always falls far short of this. While foxes often become very attached and affectionate with their families, they remain impossibly shy around visitors and strangers.<br /><br />4. Foxes Have Special Needs<br /><br />Foxes have special dietary and exercise requirements outside that of a dog. They are extremely energetic, and require loads of exercise every day. A large, carefully-built outdoor enclosure is a must. Which brings me to my next point...<br /><br />5. Foxes Are Escape Artists<br /><br />Foxes are much more proficient at getting out of enclosures than even the most determined dog. They can leap six feet in the air, climb up fences, and even cling upside down to climb along a chain link ceiling for short distances. Any enclosure that is meant to keep foxes must not only be large, but impossible to dig out of and have a full roof.<br /><br />6. Foxes Are Destructive<br /><br />Many people buy a fox under the mistaken impression that it can be kept as an indoor pet, and left with free run of the house while they are away at work. Nothing could be farther from the truth, particularly with the larger species like red foxes. They will steal and hide anything small enough for them to carry, and shred just about everything they can get their teeth in to. It is nearly impossible to break even the best-trained fox of these behaviors. A dog can be taught not to chew things, a fox can only be taught not to chew things while you're watching. While a fox is loose in the house, it requires constant supervision.<br /><br />In conclusion, foxes can make fascinating pets for people who are prepared to care for them. If you are interested in a pet fox, go into it with your eyes wide open, do your research, and understand that caring for a fox is not like caring for a dog.

There are a variety of different products you can use to keep your lake looking fresh, clean, and pure at all times. Some of these products can be used year-round, while some of the other products on the market are designed to be used solely during the hottest months of the year when algae blooms are most likely to occur.<br /><br />One of the most effective methods lake owners can use to keep their lakes looking clean year round is lake aerators. Lake aerators can be incredibly effective tools to keep your lake looking fresh and clean year round, because they can completely stop any algae blooms that may be present within a body of water. By increasing the availability of oxygen within water, algae blooms and other unwanted growths are hindered as a result.<br /><br />There are three different types of aerators you can purchase today. You can either have a waterfall installed in your lake, a fountain installed, or you can have an aerator system installed on the bottom of the water you are managing. All of these different methods can be very effective in reducing the amount of algae growth that occurs in water. I found that this blog demonstrated this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ftreadmillevolution.com%2Fquestions-long-called-interview-target-sears%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://treadmillevolution.com/questions-long-called-interview-target-sears/</a>   webpage.<br /><br />Aerators that are installed on the floor of a lake are often believed to be the most effective systems available, because they add to the oxygen deposits that are present in the body of water they reside in. Waterfalls on the other hand only add oxygen to the parts of the lake they are closest to. Fountains suffer from the same drawbacks, because they generally only add oxygen to the surface of a pond or lake.<br /><br />Of course, introducing a new aerator into your pond may not be the only water management tactic you need to implement to keep it clean and attractive. Other methods you might want to take advantage of to make your water more attractive include lake dye and beneficial bacteria.<br /><br />Lake dye can be a great addition to any kinds of water, because these products can greatly reduce the growth of algae blooms that occur within it. These products can also be incredibly useful, because they can increase the crispness and clarity of water as well. Along with performing all of these tasks, they can also give a lake a more attractive appearance and make it much more appealing to the senses overall.<br /><br />Beneficial bacteria can also be used to remove muck and grime from a body of water. Fish, falling leaves, and an assortment of other factors can dramatically alter the appearance and cleanliness of a pond or lake. By introducing beneficial bacteria into your pond, you can greatly reduce the amount of grime and muck that is present within your water.<br /><br />If you want to keep your lake or pond clean year-round, and you also want to make your water appealing to people who want to go swimming, you will certainly improve the quality of your lake or pond by introducing an aerator, lake dyes, and beneficial bacteria into your water today. Once you add these lake treatment products to your water, the water will be much more attractive, crisper, and cleaner throughout.

You can do this by modifying your diet and activity level. You can achieve this target by following a 1000 or 800 calorie diet. But this diet plan is not recommended for extended period of time. There are many crash diets that promise you to lose weight within short span of time. But unfortunately many are unhealthy and can spoil your health.<br /><br />You need to rip off weight in a right way. Losing weight requires slight change in diet, you need to cut out few foods or need to eat them moderately. You may also need to incorporate exercise in your day to day life. Once you start experiencing weight loss, you will get motivated and follow the steps without any pain. Please do stay away from crash diet plans or any other unhealthy eating habits.<br /><br />Don't go for any Fad diets as they are not permanent. &quot;Eat less and Exercise more&quot; should be your motto to achieve this goal. Be realistic with this goal and follow the motto firmly.<br /><br />Do not starve<br /><br />No Fasting or Starving is allowed when you want to lose weight. Starving will tempt you to eat more and you will end up in eating unhealthy foods to quench your hunger. Starving will make you unhealthy and weak. When you skip your breakfast, your body keeps more space for the next meal and your body metabolism also slows down. By starving, if you lose 20 pounds, you may gain 25 pounds back. This is the reality.<br /><br />Drink plenty of water<br /><br />It is recommended to drink at least 8 glasses of water every day. You can try drinking water before having food. You will feel full and may eat less. Also when you feel hungry, most often it is due to thirst. Drink only plain water to stop hunger, do not drink coffee or other beverages. Also, do not get confused that hunger is always thirst.<br /><br />Drinking lot of water helps to regularize appetite, drains out the toxins, and keeps the system clean by increasing metabolic rate. Keep in mind that you need to lose at least 3500 calories per day to lose 10 pounds in a week!<br /><br />Eat less Calories<br /><br />If you want to lose 10 pounds in a week, eat fewer calories than what you actually burn. You can easily burn more calories by increasing your activity levels and cutting down calories in daily diet plan. You can plan to cut down 400 to 500 calories per day and practise exercise every day to lose weight quickly. Eat highly nutritious food and cut down all the unhealthy foods.<br /><br />Diet with essential nutrients<br /><br />Eat foods rich in fiber - this will activate rapid weight loss. Foods like grape fruit, orange, lemon, watermelon, apple, vegetables like carrot, cabbage, broccoli, celery are all rich in Vitamin C and act as Fat burners. Oatmeal, skimmed milk, whole grains, fiber enriched cereals, raw vegetables, whole wheat pasta etc are also considered as foods that burn fat. You can have Oats, wheat or corn flakes low in sugar etc for breakfast rather than skipping it. Low fat yogurt also helps in weight loss as it is rich in calcium. Eat Soy products, Fish, shellfish, egg whites, non fat dairy products, etc to ensure rapid weight loss. Eat salads with tomato, carrot, beet root, capsicum, cabbage, cucumber and lettuce. Protein rich foods help maintain blood sugar levels and stimulate weight loss.<br /><br />You need to eat at least 1000 calories per day when you are on diet. Make it up the required calorie level by eating smaller and frequent meals. Do not eat at a time. Eat equal portions every time and have a light dinner. When the day is over, you may not need too much energy. End each day with light supper and enjoy your sleep.<br /><br />Eat only as much as you want and do not eat too much. Over eating is dangerous.<br /><br />Avoid Sugary foods<br /><br />Drop sugar from your diet and see the difference. It helps you lose weight quickly. Cut down your salt intake as well. Too much of salt and sugar makes you gain weight. Avoid taking carbonated beverages, corn syrup, cakes, cookies, chocolates, pastries etc. Replace coffee and other beverages with water or fat burner like Green tea, Herbal tea or juices.<br /><br />Avoid Unhealthy snacks<br /><br />Do not consume unhealthy snacks like potato chips, cookies, candy, popcorn, cakes etc. Stay away from fried foods as well. You get addicted to these items and keep eating more and more. Stop eating these tempting foods when you are watching TV or movies. Instead you can try eating Snacks like soups, salads, fruits, water-rich foods. They are good source of nutrition and avail weight loss quickly. Include more fiber rich food, fruits, vegetables and other organic products in your diet. Low fat dairy items are also good for weight loss. Reduce carbohydrate intake, this will help you shed unwanted pounds drastically. There are many tasty and nutritious alternatives available without carbohydrates. Try these healthy snacks to lose 10 pounds fast!!<br /><br />Do not eat processed or packaged foods as they don't contain essential minerals and nutrients. They are higher in sodium and fat content. Go for fresh foods and avoid packaged foods. Researchers predict that people put on more weight when they eat out while their body weight is under control when they eat home cooked food.<br /><br />Shed pounds fast by Exercise<br /><br />Run, Walk, Jog, Swim, lift etc to lose weight fast but do not overexert. Include Exercise in your busy schedule. There are many simple ways to burn calories. You can burn extra fat by walking, taking the stairs, dancing, standing, aerobic exercise etc. Practise regular work out routines and track the activity levels in a diary.

Caillou was first introduced in books by Chrsitine L'Heureux and illustrated by Helene Desputeaux. The books were later adapted for a television show which is now in it's 6th season and runs on PBS kids.<br /><br />Since Caillou is such a curious child with a huge imagination he is always on the go either painting, cooking or even being a scientist. This makes Caillou a very popular character and tv show.<br /><br />If your child has asked for a Caillou birthday party this year then you are in luck as this is a very fun theme! There are plenty of different party supplies, ideas and creative games to play.<br /><br />The decorations can be as simple or as complex as you'd like. We suggest primary colors that correspond with the Caillou theme such as blue, yellow and red. This can be incorporated with balloons, streamers and a tablecloth. Then simply add a few official Caillou merchandise to the decorations such as a wall decal or pinnate. You can also have an episode of Caillou playing in the background as the kids arrive or right after lunch. The kids will enjoy watching their favourite show especially if it's one they haven't seen before! I found that this webpage showed this nicely on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdslrcamerareviewer.com%2Fchoose-digital-slr%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://dslrcamerareviewer.com/choose-digital-slr/</a>  weblog.<br /><br />Next, the party games. Be sure the party games are active, creative and something that they can use their imagination. This can be as simple as pin the tail on the donkey to having a decorate a place-mat station. The place-mat station would be setup with a white card-stock paper, crayons, stencils, and stickers. The kids can then create whatever image they want using their supplies. Once they're finished they can either add them to their party favours or use them while they eat food.<br /><br />Another party game idea would include a relay race where they have to dress up in a silly costume. This could include overalls, striped shirt, hat, scarf and oversized boots. Although, this sounds like a silly idea kids love this game and enjoy laughing with their friends.<br /><br />Remember with the party games to include time for free-play where the kids get to use their imagination to run, jump and explore on their own.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is the food for the party. You can choose to do something simple such as grilled cheese sandwiches and veggies. However, another option to consider is a 'create you own pizza' station. In one episode of Caillou he becomes a chef so you can show that episode to them and they will want to partake in creating the food themselves. The pizza's are simple to make as you can buy pre-made shells, sliced pepperoni and then add whatever veggies are popular (tomatoes, green peppers and mushrooms). The pizza's take about 10-20 minutes to cook and would be a good time for the 'decorate your placemat' activity!<br /><br />Hopefully these ideas for your party help to create a truly unique and fun event. Remember, that Caillou is all about imagination and fun and try to incorporate this into your party!

It is called Cost Segregation. But your probably wondering what it is.<br /><br />Cost segregation relates to depreciation of commercial buildings. Normally, a commercial building is depreciated over 39 years. What cost segregation does is take the whole building and it breaks the building up into various parts that can be depreciated between 7 to 15 years. For example, the carpet and flooring in a commercial building wears out before 39 years, so we can depreciate it in much fewer years. The benefit from this is you get a huge tax break. Instead of taking a small deprecation deduction over 39 years you take a large deduction over 7 to 15 years. There are parts of the building that will still be deprecated over 39 years, but you will get a much higher depreciation deduction the first 7 to 15 years. You can start cost segregating your building even if you have owned for several years. I found that this blog demonstrated this well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jpa2VyZXZpZXdzaGFjay5jb20vNjExL2hpZ2hlc3QtbWlsZWFnZS15b3V2ZS1tb3RvcmN5bGluZy8_" target="_blank">Hans Attebery</a> blog post.<br /><br />There is one potential drawback from cost segregation. That is if you decide to the sale the commercial building, it can cause a taxable event in where you will have to recapture the deprecation from previous years as income. You can avoid this or at least prepare for it by making sure you are proactive in your tax planning and consulting with your accountant.<br /><br />Here is an example of the savings that you can have if you use this method of depreciation. One of our clients bought a rather large commercial office building. He put down a large down payment to purchase it. Since the down payment on real estate is not tax deductible and since a commercial property is typically depreciated over 39 years, his tax deduction was rather small, and he had a large tax liability for that year. We suggested doing a cost segregation. What this entailed was hiring an engineer and grouping the cost of the various parts of the building together. Then it was possible to depreciate the building over fewer years thereby being able to take a bigger deduction the first years of owning the building. In the end, doing a cost segregation saved our client $20,000 in taxes.

But a color scheme can be interpreted in many different ways - imagine these two very different weddings using yellow, white and green...<br /><br /><strong>Citrus psychedelic</strong><br /><br />The bright lemon yellow and lime green of citrus fruits provide the color inspiration and theme for this wedding. Lemons and limes pop up all over the place, starting with the white invitations printed with a design of the cut fruit creating a free-wheeling pop art abstract graphic of circles and triangles. Arriving at the ceremony venue, guests are greeted by two miniature lemon trees heavy with fruit, that mark the beginning of the aisle. The service booklets are delicately scented with a lemon fragrance and white, yellow and bright green streamers gently wave at the sides of the seating area. The bride's party arrives and there is no mistaking the bridesmaids, as they appear in bright printed dresses of yellow and green teamed with lime shoes. To contrast against the busy pattern of their short dresses, their bouquets are white. The bride appears all in white, except for the bright yellow shoes that peek out from under her dress. Her bouquet is a riot of yellow, green and white.<br /><br />At the reception the citrus theme continues. Guests are refreshed with lime cocktails while waiting to be seated, and find that the wedding reception centrepieces include slices of lemon and lime floating in the vases. Name cards at each place are slipped inside a cut made in a lemon or lime, and favour bags alternate in lime green and bright yellow. A lemon garnish appears on the entree and a slice of sugared lime is popped into the dessert. Finally, full of good food and fine wine, the guests take to the dance floor, kicking aside the fluorescent green and gold balloons that fill the floor.<br /> I found that this website showed this really well on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Jvd2luZ21hY2hpbmVzcmV2aWV3LmNvbS9zdGFtaW5hLWJvZHktdHJhYy1nbGlkZXItMTA1MC1yb3dpbmctbWFjaGluZS1yZXZpZXctdmlkZW8v" target="_blank">Letha Andert</a> web site.<br /><strong>Sugar and spice</strong><br /><br />The afternoon sun warms the cream walls of the country church, turning them a soft shade of butter yellow. Tall vases of traditional flowers - roses, gladioli, dahlias and carnations - stand at either side of the altar, which holds another arrangement in white and yellow. At the end of each pew a sweet posy hangs, attached with a white ribbon. The guests refer to their invitations - printed with a yellow lace border and tucked into envelopes lined in a fresh spring green - as the bridal party arrives.<br /><br />The bride is all in white - a simple gown with broderie anglaise detailing. The bridesmaid's dresses match but in soft yellow worn with pale yellow shoes. They carry posies of yellow and white roses with green accents.<br /><br />After the ceremony the guests are directed to a garden party. A couple of white tents with yellow bunting provide shade, and lemonade is handed out. A generous afternoon tea complete with cucumber sandwiches and miniature tarts is served, the guests sit at tables under umbrellas and dine off yellow plates with white polka-dots, teamed with yellow and white striped napkins. The wedding cake is a sumptuous tiered affair iced in white and decorated with yellow blossoms and green foliage. On leaving the guests are presented with individual cookies shaped like wedding cakes and ornately decorated with butter yellow and white frosting.

You go to a local fair and there at the author's table is a row of smiling hopefuls, eager to sell their books. A few are beautiful books, either self-published or produced by traditional publishers. But so many are poorly written, poorly produced, with amateurish covers and cheap bindings. The author's smiles are wearing thin as they realize that the world isn't flocking to buy their books, and they're just beginning to wonder if there's something wrong with this picture.<br /><br />Score another for the vanity presses. The poor authors, with no knowledge of the business end of publishing, have been snookered out of hundreds or even thousands of dollars and now have cases of unmarketable books serving as very expensive doorstops.<br /><br />In these days of POD (publish-on-demand) technology, the vanity presses may promise to ship the books when they are ordered, which at least relieves the author of having to warehouse the books. But the vanities still charge large amounts of money and the author is still left with an empty bank account and shattered dreams.<br /><br />Or worse. Some scammers take money from hopeful authors and deliver nothing at all.<br /><br />The good news is that with a little knowledge, it isn't too hard to spot a scam. Here are some obvious red flags to look for:<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #1: &quot;We'll publish your book for ONLY $595!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Remember this one rule above all: legitimate publishers pay YOU for the rights to publish your book. You should never have to pay anyone to publish your work &lt;i&gt;unless&lt;/i&gt; you choose to self-publish.<br /><br />To get a book published, you have to write the very best book you can. You must study the market, and use a current market guide to select the most appropriate publisher. You submit your manuscript using a standard manuscript format, which is described in most good books on writing and publishing. While you wait for a reply, you go to work on your next project. If a publisher is interested, an editor will contact you and make an offer. The publisher will pay you an advance against royalties, and once the advance is earned back, you will earn royalties on further sales. You or your agent may also sell other subsidiary rights, such as foreign translation rights or movie rights. Chances are high, however, that your manuscript will be rejected. If that happens you select the next publisher on your list and send the manuscript there, then go back to work on your next project.<br /><br />If you want to self-publish, the best way to go about it is to create your own small publishing company. You give your company a name, you choose a good printing service, you buy the ISBN number and file for copyright. If you pay for &quot;publishing,&quot; but the book bears the imprint of another publisher, that company is a vanity publisher. A good printing service will encourage you to use your own imprint. You have a much better chance of getting a distributor to carry your books if you use your own imprint. Most distributors steer clear of vanity publishers. I found that this page described this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JsZW5kZXJldmlld3MuY29tLzEyMTkvc21vb3RoaWUtaWRlYXMv" target="_blank">Otha Keath</a> article.<br /><br />If you want only a few copies, such as a memoir meant only for family, look for a good book binding service.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #2: &quot;Authors wanted by major publisher!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />No legitimate publisher ever has to advertise for authors. All major publishers have gigantic slush piles stacked high with far more manuscripts than they will ever be able to use, most of which are of poor quality. If you see an ad in the back of a magazine that offers to &quot;publish&quot; your book, or suggests that they &quot;need&quot; authors, chances are high that it is a vanity press.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #3: &quot;We know the secret for instant success!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />There is no &quot;instant success&quot; in the publishing world. Most famous authors worked hard for years to become an &quot;overnight success.&quot; Sometimes a lucky break will propel a new author to the top of the bestseller list, but remember, their story is just one out of millions. Most authors never get that kind of fame. If the opening page of the site talks about how your book could be a best-seller, be cautious. Real publishers don't make those kinds of promises, because they know the reality of the publishing business.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #4: &quot;Traditional publishing is dead/a rip-off/not worth your time.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />A publishing company that disparages traditional publishing is almost certainly either a vanity publisher or an outright scam. What they are disparaging are long-established honest businesses that carefully select the manuscripts that are most likely to sell and pay the authors for the rights to publish these works.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #5: &quot;We'll list your books on Amazon.com!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Getting your book listed on Amazon.com is as easy as going online and filling out a form. Anyone can do it. And a listing on Amazon isn't a guaranteed path to success. Even in this day and age of online commerce, something less than 10% of all books sold are sold online. The vast majority of books are sold through bricks-and-mortar bookstores. While you may possibly be able to talk your local bookstores into carrying your self-published book, the only way to get it into bookstores across the nation is by getting a distributor to carry it. That can be expensive (which is one reason that the vanities don't bother with distribution), and distributors won't touch vanity books (which is the other reason). Distributors and bookstores also don't like POD (publish on demand) books, because they can't be returned if they don't sell. Booksellers, unlike most businesses, expect to be able to return or destroy unsold books and get their money back. It sounds crazy to other businesses, but that's how it is. If the publisher can't offer distribution services to get your book into bookstores, it's not a publisher that will serve you well.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Red Flag #6: Bad review on Preditors and Editors and Writer Beware&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Yes, it's really spelled that way, for alliterative purposes. &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anotherealm.com%2Fprededitors%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.anotherealm.com/prededitors/</a>]Preditors and Editors[/url] is a website chock full of scam warnings and wise advice to writers. &lt;a target=&quot;_new&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfwa.org%2Fbeware%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfwa.org/beware/</a>]Writer Beware[/url], on the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America website, has a list of current scam alerts. Both are useful when researching a potential publisher. If any publisher disparages either of these sites, beware!<br /><br />If you can spot these red flags, you can avoid most publishing scams. The best way to protect yourself, though, is to educate yourself about the publishing industry. Read as many books on writing and publishing as you can get your hands on. Find out how the industry works, and find out how to market your work in the genre you are writing for. Stay abreast of industry trends by reading Publisher's Weekly or visiting their website. With a little education, you can help put the scammers out of business.

The acting of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connely are both superb, as is the story, which I find quite moving.<br /><br />The movie begins at Princeton University, where Nash (Crowe) is attending graduate school in math. He is brilliant but socially awkward. He becomes best friends with his roommate Charles, a literature student.<br /><br />After college, Nash accepts a position at MIT, along with his friends Sol and Bender. Shortly thereafter he meets Alicia (Connely), with whom he falls in love and eventually marries. Nash runs into his former roommate Charles, who introduces him to his young niece Marcee. Nash also meets a Department of Defense agent, William Parcher. Nash is invited to the pentagon to crack a secret encryption of an enemy communication, which he does in his head. Parcher also asks Nash to look for secret codes in newspapers and magazines. Nash begins behaving erratically. I found that this blogger demonstrated this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2tpdGNoZW5rbml2ZXNyZXZpZXdzLm5ldC8xMzgzL3B1cmNoYXNlZC1iZWQtYmF0aC13ZWRkaW5nLXJlZ2lzdHJ5Lw__" target="_blank">Kenisha Stack</a> website.<br /><br />Sol starts watching Nash and eventually gets him sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility, where it is discovered that he's been suffering from hallucinations and schizophrenia. Eventually he's released from the hospital with the provision that he take antipsychotic medication. Unfortunately the medication has some bad side effects, including impotence, so he secretly stops taking it, whence his hallucinations return.<br /><br />Eventually Nash is able to keep his illness under control when he realizes that Marcee has not aged since he met her several years ago. He then realizes that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher are products of his imagination. Over the next several years, he slowly recuperates. Eventually he receives the Nobel Prize in Economics as an old man.

I found that this web page described this incredibly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5UaGFpbGFuZE11YXlDYW1wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">sparring</a> weblog.Do we need snacks? Do kids need snacks? Snacks are fun, and at times can be lost in junk food and eaten in mindless inattention. What if snack time could be something totally fun AND nutritious? Check it out!<br /><br />What if a healthy snack was a time for presence, full focus of the food being eaten. What if, since a snack is small and eaten faster than a &quot;meal&quot; you and your children could play a game of the senses. What does the food smell like? Is it savory, sweet, minty? What does it smell like? How about the colors, the brighter the foods the better, especially with fruits an vegs. Really spend some time here before you and your child bite into the food. Then take a very small bite and roll it around in the mouth. What is the texture and finally the taste. Oh, the outstanding taste, salty, sour, sweet, yummy, yucky, allow for all and any responses. Kids don't have to like every thing that you offer, but keep offering new options. Snacks are a great time to make these offerings since it s not a big deal if the child doesn't eat them. It's not like their entire food for the day depends on them eating this food. It's a snack for God's sake! Have fun at snack time.<br /><br />So now that you have spent time with the senses and the food, next time try different foods with the eyes closed and no touching, feed each other a food, kids feed parent and parent to kids, the can guild trust and a new game. See if you each can get the snack into your mouth without touching it.<br /><br />Snacks can be the funnest thing in the world. What about going to the store and seeing what new &lt;u&gt;snack you can create&lt;/u&gt; that takes nothing other than your hands to eat. No needing for tableware,like any fruits, OK most fruits and vegs. Go beyond the fruits and vegs to other nutritious foods that can be a hands only snack. Get creative! Try some interesting sauces on snacks, try making humus with new ingredients, let your kids pick the new ingredients for the humus or salsa, that way then can learn what things taste good together and what things they don't like.<br /><br />Remember what you ate as a snack as a kid and share those experiences with your kids. Talk about those that were great and great for you and those that were so yummy and not so good for the tummy. Discuss what makes one snack better than another. Perhaps it's the taste, texture, the nutrition or not. How about making a new snack that no one has ever had before. Create a new mix of granola rolls with new and exciting grains. Again anything can be a snack and it's a great time to play with food, do you allow your kids to play with their foods, snack time is play time.<br /><br />Can you take these suggestions and begin to use them at your snack time at work? Take the time to truly experience the foods that you eat. Know them intimately then you can be more open to your kids playing with their snacks.<br /><br />Snack: what is a snack but a time out with food. Make &lt;em&gt;snacks fun and healthy&lt;/em&gt;. Time out of the rush and stress of the day to play and enjoy the foods we are eating and knowing that.

Many researchers have also found that drinking red wine in moderation can bring you great health benefits such as a reduced risk of heart disease. I personally believe that this blog owner described this smartly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL3BhY2thZ2Vz" target="_blank">muay thai classes</a> article.Many chefs have found that using red wine to cook with can add great taste to foods and offer something different to the mix. Whether you are a wine expert or just an occasional drinker you can enjoy a glass of red wine with your meal.<br /><br />One of the things you should consider when you are starting to explore different wines is to go on a wine tasting because it will allow you to try many different wines and you may find a new favorite. You can check in your area to see if there is a store that offers wine tasting and if you are really lucky you can find a vineyard in your town that you can do a tasting and also learn how wine is made. It is true that most wines over time get better with age and if you store them in the right place they can become really wonderful to drink.<br /><br />Remember that when enjoying red wine you want to try different ones to find the flavor that you like. It is also important to use a red wine glass because it will allow for the wine to breathe. Usually this type of glass is more open at the top and they are generally larger than white wine glasses.

Why are Gu<br/><br/>First off, regardless of what your heart tells you or how your mind  forces you to think, DO NOT obsess with a guy you can never have. There are so many more fish in the sea, so many more guys you can love who actually deserve your love. Do not ever hurt yourself for some guy who will never learn to appreciate you. The signs are the following:<br /><br />If you are his candidate for a Booty Call and then he doesn't know you during the day.<br /><br />If he uses you.<br /><br />If he abuses you.<br /><br />If he hurts you. For instance, he calls you Fat. He doesn't tease you playfully, he downright treats you like garbage.<br /><br />If he talks behind your back about you. If he starts rumours about you...<br /><br />Understand this, guys can really be evil sometimes. Move on if you answered yes to any of the above.<br /><br />Now that we've got that out of the way, here comes the juicy part. How can you tell if a guy likes you? You like him. You feel it in the gut he likes you back. But you need some substantial proof. I will not go into the types of guys out there, because in the end, there will always be a group of guys who have no niche to fall into. These [url=]latterly[/url] tips are not foolproof, since human nature is always fickle. So, I suggest you read this and use it as a reference and not your bible.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Strategy ONE&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Ask him. He says he likes you. Case closed. You are done. But, fearing rejection, can you even do that? If only things were so simple. I'll tell you this. Just ask him. This will save you a lot of time. If he says no, then you can understand that he doesn't and may not even after knowing you for a bit of time. Therefore, it will be him who regrets later on when he falls for you in return, granted you guys will hang out and stuff... Maybe not, since if he does reject you, it will be too embarrassing... So what you can do is this....<br /><br />&lt;i&gt;&quot;Do you like me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;No.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I knew it! I don't like you either.&quot; Haha!<br /><br />&quot;Do you like me?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, as a friend.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Me too. I was worried because I thought you didn't like me as a friend...&quot; Saved!&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br />If he says he likes you in a way that he likes you likes you and not as friend, then you've just scored yourself your dream guy.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Signs that he likes you&lt;/u&gt;<br />&lt;br&gt;He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.<br /><br />He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)<br /><br />He does things to deliberately gain your attention.<br /><br />He stutters when he speaks to you.<br /><br />His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.<br /><br />He waits for you. He looks out for you.<br /><br />He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.<br /><br />He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.<br /><br />He listens to you and actually remembers little details.<br /><br />He notices slight changes in your appearance.<br /><br />He seems sad when you ignore him.<br /><br />He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.<br /><br />His friends all know you when you don't know them.<br /><br />He smiles back when you smile at him.<br /><br />He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!<br /><br />He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Signs that he is a player&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.<br /><br />He places his hands on you with ease.<br /><br />Every other girl likes him.<br /><br />Just be careful.<br /><br />There are many more signs, but anyway, just go with your heart, take care of yourself, and let things happen naturally. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.
