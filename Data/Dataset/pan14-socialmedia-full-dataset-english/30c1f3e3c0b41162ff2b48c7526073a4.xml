The tools are primarily to work with you with organization and possibly catch something that you may have missed. Tools to help you with backlinks are LinkHounds which often helps sort links influenced by IP Addresses, also, there's Domain Backlink Checker which does the same but sorting the backlinks by first and minute level domains. Link Diagnosis I've found provides most sorting options and information. You can sort by anchor text, page rank, type, and internal and external links. <br /><br />It's very important that you review your backlinks and compare them with all your competitors. Good Search Engine Optimization involves a long time spent researching and reviewing your competitors' information, this way you will learn new techniques and get inspiration on how you can apply them and others for a own website. Hiring a professional SEO Consultant will try this entire process for you, however, make sure they will know that quality is more important than quantity. <br />.<br />A backlink is a website on another webpage leading to your site and also blog, and is used by the search engines to determine a sites ranking on the web. See Google's own quote relating to, what are backlinks, at the end of this article. <br /><br />Backlinks are vital for getting your website ranked well in Google and also other search engines, because the number of relevant backlinks to a webpage is one indication to Google in the popularity of that web site.

PageRank is the position that a page or URL has in the search results for a particular keyword search query. <br /><br />There are plenty of ways that Google and other search engines verify the true value of a backlink. If both sites, yours and the one linking to yours, has content covering the same keyword topic, the backlink is considered relevant and possesses strong influence on the search engine rankings for the webpage that received the backlink. <br /><br />Another characteristic of an valuable backlink is the anchor text with the backlink. Anchor text is a descriptive labeling of the web link as it appears on the webpage. Googlebots and search engine spiders analyze this anchor text to ascertain how relevant it may be to the content that's to the webpage it leads to. So, the anchor text and webpage content relevancy are highly significant in the search engine results page (SERP) rankings of a website, in regard to the specific keyword or phrase a person has searched on. <br /><br />It ought to be said that building too many backlinks over a short time of time can purchase a website's ranking penalized, together with in extreme cases, de-indexed once and for all. Because of the many artificial link building methods used in recent years to merely &quot;spam&quot; together with &quot;fool&quot; the search engines' algorithms inside awarding sites with undeserved higher page ranks, Google and other search engines are insistent with backlinks being relevant and beneficial to the users. &quot; I think we got the point, right? <br />.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbXByb3ZlYWxleGFyYW5raW5nLm9yZy8_" target="_blank">buy alexa traffic</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZW9taXhlci5uZXQv" target="_blank">buy backlinks</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL29rYmFja2xpbmtzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">backlink</a>
