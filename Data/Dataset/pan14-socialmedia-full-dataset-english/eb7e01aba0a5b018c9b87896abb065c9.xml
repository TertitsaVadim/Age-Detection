<br /><br />and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a
<br /><br />big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that
<br /><br />after dinner, she would like to go out and make love
<br /><br />for the first time.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Well, the boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex
<br /><br />before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get
<br /><br />some condoms. He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and
<br /><br />the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour.
<br /><br />He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and
<br /><br />sex.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many
<br /><br />condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
<br /><br />pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
<br /><br />thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents
<br /><br />house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm
<br /><br />so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
<br /><br />where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly
<br /><br />offers to say grace and bows his head.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer,
<br /><br />with his head down.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the
<br /><br />girlfriend leans over and whispers to the
<br /><br />boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * *
<br /><br />The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your
<br /><br />father was a pharmacist.&quot;
<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *
<br /><br />If you DON'T re-post this in 1 minute you will
<br /><br />have bad sex for life!!! - not likely ;]
<br /><br />and...

<br /><br />the person u luv!! &amp; 2morrow will be da best day of ur life, so

<br /><br />Girl: &quot;Besides that, I'm waiting for someone special. Someone that I want to be with for the rest of my life to be my first.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: &quot;I'm not special to you?&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: &quot;You're my friend. That's all.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: looks forward and keeps driving.
<br /><br />5 minutes pass.......
<br /><br />Guy: starts to run his hand up the girl's thigh.
<br /><br />Girl: moves his hand, &quot;Don't touch me.&quot;.
<br /><br />Guy: tries to kiss her.
<br /><br />Girl: screams, &quot;Would you stop.&quot;
<br /><br />Guy: continues trying.
<br /><br />Girl: moves to the back seat
<br /><br />Guy: parks on an abandoned street and gets in the backseat with the girl.he starts to kiss her.

<br /><br />&quot;What's wrong dearest??&quot; asked the confused husband.
<br /><br />&quot;Oh darling,&quot; sobbed the wife, &quot;I was cleaning little Suzie's room when I found whips, handcuffs and chains under her bedm, along with a very erotic porn magazine! What ever are we going to do???&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; replied the man...
<br /><br />&quot;I guess a spanking is out of the question?&quot;

<br /><br />A little girl and her mother are walking through a park and see two teenagers having sex on a bench. The little girl asks her mother what they're are doing. After a moments hesitation, the mother replies &quot;They're making cakes.&quot;
<br /><br />The next day the little girl and her mother go to the zoo. The little girl sees two monkeys having sex, and again asks her mother what they are doing. The mother again uses the same answer &quot;They're making cakes.&quot;
<br /><br />The next morning the little girl says to her mother &quot;Mummy, You and Daddy were making cakes on the lounge last night.&quot;
<br />The Mother replies &quot; How do you know?&quot;
<br />The girl says &quot;I licked the icing off the sofa!&quot;

<br /><br />One day old man Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the Illinois State Fair. There is this man selling plane rides in his single prop show plane for $10 per person. Stumpy looks to Martha and says, &quot;Martha, I think I really should try that.&quot; Martha replies, &quot;I know you want to Stumpy, but we have a lot of bills, and you know the money is tight, and $10 is $10.&quot; So Stumpy goes without. Over the next few years they return every year, and the same thing, Stumpy wants to ride, but Martha says no money.
<br /><br />Finally, when Stumpy and Martha are both about 70 years old, Stumpy looks to Martha, and says, &quot;Martha, I'm 70 now, and I don't know if I'll ever get the chance again, so I just have to have a ride in that there airplane.&quot; Martha replies in the same old fashion, and Stumpy kind of slumps down. The pilot is standing near by and overhears the conversation...
<br /><br />The pilot pipes up, &quot;Excuse me folks, I couldn't help but hear your situation, and I have a deal for you. I'll take both of you up together, and if you can both make the entire trip without saying a word, or even making the slightest sound, I'll give the ride for free. But if either of you make a sound, its $10 each.&quot; Well, Martha and Stumpy look at each other, and agree to take the ride.
<br /><br />The pilot takes them up, and starts to do loop de loops, twists, dives, climbs and spins. No sound. The pilot lands the plane, looks back at Stumpy and says, &quot;Sir, I have to hand it to ya, you didn't make even the slightest sound and that was my best stuff.&quot; Stumpy looks back at the pilot and says, &quot;Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but $10 is $10!&quot;

<br /><br />For decades, two heroic statues, one male and one female, faced each other in a city park, until one day an angel came down from heaven.
<br /><br />&quot;You've been such exemplary statues,&quot; he announced to them, &quot;That I'm going to give you a special gift. I'm going to bring you both to life for thirty minutes, in which you can do anything you want.&quot; And with a clap of his hands, the angel brought the statues to life.
<br /><br />The two approached each other a bit shyly, but soon dashed for the bushes, from which shortly emerged a good deal of giggling, laughter, and shaking of branches. Fifteen minutes later, the two statues emerged from the bushes, wide grins on their faces.
<br /><br />&quot;You still have fifteen more minutes,&quot; said the angel, winking at them.
<br /><br />Grinning even more widely the female statue turned to the male statue and said, &quot;Great! Only this time you hold the pigeon down and I'll crap on it's head.&quot;

<br /><br />An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and back together again. The boy asked his father, &quot;What is this, Father?&quot; The father [never having seen an elevator] responded &quot;Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don't know what it is.&quot;
<br /><br />While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room. The walls closed and the boy and his father watched small circles of lights with numbers above the walls light up. They continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction.
<br /><br />The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman stepped out. The father said to his son, &quot;Go get your mother.&quot;
<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
<br /><br />This man, his wife and their Border Collie, Maisy were out for a drive in the country one afternoon in their new convertible, with the top down. The husband and wife were enjoying the scenery as they drove along. While unbeknownst to them, Maisy gave birth to seven puppies while laying on the back seat of the automobile. The couple continued to drive along, unaware of the new arrivals. Soon the road began to deteriorate and was beginning to become quite rough. Suddenly, the car ran over a deep pothole in the road, and one of Maisy's puppies bounced up and out of the car, landing on the roadway just in front of a police car that had been following the man and his wife.
<br /><br />The police officer switched on his lights and siren, and soon had the couple pulled over to the side of the road. What are you pulling me over for? Queried the startled driver. The officer responded, &quot;I pulled you over for creating a &quot;Road Hazard, for other drivers!&quot; What hazard? Asked the man. &quot;A puppy bounced out of your car and put myself, and several other drivers at risk, trying to avoid hitting it.&quot; Now your Drivers License and Proof of Insurance please. Thank you Sir... And the 'Bitches' name, Sir. Hey! How dare you call my wife a bitch! Sir, I was referring to the dog! Oh... Her name is Maisy. What do you want her name for, officer? Well Sir, after I write your ticket for &quot;Endangering Vehicular Traffic&quot;, I am going to cite your dog, Maisy, for Littering!

<br /><br />After being with her all evening, the man couldn't take another minute with his blind date. Earlier, he had secretly arranged to have a friend call him to the phone so he would have an excuse to leave if something like this happened.
<br /><br />When he returned to the table, he lowered his eyes, put on a grim expression and said, &quot;I have some bad news. My grandfather just died.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Thank heavens,&quot; his date replied. &quot;If yours hadn't, mine would have had to!&quot;
<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
<br /><br />At a jewelry store, a young man bought an expensive locket as a present for his girlfriend. &quot;Don't you want her name engraved upon it?&quot; asked the jeweler. The young man thought for a moment, and then, ever the pragmatic, steadfastly replied,
<br /><br />&quot;No, just engrave it: To My One And Only Love. That way, if we break up and she throws it back to me in anger, I can use it again.&quot;
<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
<br /><br />A man and his wife were driving through country on his way from New York to California. Looking at his fuel gauge, he decided to stop at the next gasoline station and fill up. About 15 minutes later, he spots a Mobil station and pulls over to the high octane pump.
<br /><br />&quot;What can I do for y'all?&quot; asks the attendant. &quot;Fill `er up with high test,&quot; replies the driver. While the attendant is filling up the tank, he's looking the car up and down. &quot;What kinda car is this?&quot; he asks. &quot;I never seen one like it before.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; responds the driver, his chest swelling up with pride, &quot;this, my boy is a 1999 Cadillac DeVille.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;What all's it got in it?&quot; asks the attendant. &quot;Well,&quot; says the driver, &quot;it has everything. It's loaded with power steering, power seats, power sun roof, power mirrors, AM/FM radio with a 10 deck CD player in the trunk with 100 watts per channel, 8 speaker stereo, rack and pinion steering, disk brakes all around, leather interior, digital instrument package, and best of all, a 8.8 liter V12 engine.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Wow,&quot; says the attendant, &quot;that's really something!&quot; &quot;How much do I owe you for the gasoline?&quot; asks the driver. &quot;That'll be $30.17,&quot; says the attendant.
<br /><br />The driver pulls out his money clip and peels off a $20 and a $10. He goes into his other pocket and pulls out a handful of change. Mixed up with the change are a few golf tees. &quot;What are those little wooden things?&quot; asks the attendant. &quot;That's what I put my balls on when I drive,&quot; says the driver. &quot;Wow,&quot; says the attendant, &quot;those Cadillac people think of everything!&quot;

<br /><br />Mr. Smith wanted to become a teacher in the worst way, but the only job he could find was as an instructor at an all female college teaching sex education. His wife was a very jealous woman so Mr. Smith decided he would tell his wife that he would be teaching sailing at this college so that she would not get angry. He was very happy and for months all was well. As fate would have it, one day in the grocery store check out lane, Mrs. Smith overheard a group of girls standing in line behind her talking about college and their instructor Mr. Smith. The girls went on and on about how great this Mr. Smith was at teaching their class. The cashier handed Mrs. Smith her change and said, &quot;Have a great day Mrs. Smith, and thank you, again.&quot; One of the girls in line heard the cashier, and asked Mrs. Smith if she was related to the Mr. Smith that was teaching at the college. Mrs. Smith replied, &quot;Yes, he is my husband.&quot; Well that set off a torrent of accolades about how knowledgeable Mr. Smith was about the subject matter he was teaching, about how he got the whole class to discuss their fears about learning the subject. Well Mrs. Smith was taken back by what she heard from these girls and replied, &quot;I don't know how you find him to be so gifted at teaching you this course. You know he only tried it twice in his life. The first time he tried it, he got sick, and the second time, his hat blew off and he just quit.&quot;

<br /><br />A pompous self made grocer named Bates gets his son into an expensive private school. On day One the whole family is there to see the little blighter begin his first day at school. The grocer, his family in tow, saunters into the principal's office and introduces himself thus: &quot;I am Sir Shortweight Bates. This is my wife, Lady Bates, my daughter Miss Bates and my son Master Bates.&quot; &quot;Oh does he?&quot; asks the bemused principal, &quot;we will soon get him out of that terrible habit.&quot;
<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
<br /><br />A stranger was seated next to Little Johnny on the plane when the stranger turned to the Little Johnny and said, &quot;Let's talk. I've heard that flights will go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger.&quot;
<br /><br />Little Johnny, who had just opened his book, closed it slowly, and said to the stranger, &quot;What would you like to discuss?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;How about nuclear power?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;OK,&quot; said Little Johnny. &quot;That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. &quot;A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass. The same stuff. Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Jeez,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;I have no idea.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Little Johnny, &quot;How is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know shit?&quot;
<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
<br /><br />A taxi passenger tapped the driver on the shoulder to ask him a question. The driver screamed, lost control of the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the footpath, and stopped centimetres from a shop window.
<br /><br />For a second everything went quiet in the cab, then the driver said, &quot;Look mate, don't ever do that again. You scared the daylights out of me!&quot; The passenger apologized and said, &quot;I didn't realize that a little tap would scare you so much. &quot;The driver replied, &quot;Sorry, it's not really your fault. Today is my first day as a cab driver. I've been driving a funeral van for the last 25 years.&quot;
