<br /><strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9mYW5zc29jY2VyamVyc2V5LmNvbS91a3JhaW5lLTctc2hldmNoZW5rby0yMDEyLWhvbWUtc29jY2VyLWplcnNleXMtcDQwNS5odG1s" target="_blank">Ukraine 7 Shevchenko 2012 Home Jersey</a></em></strong>. It is a description worthy of footballing legends such as Ian Rush or Christian Vieri, but not honest enough for the 27-year-old Celtic star's style of play.Gifted with tremendous dribbling ability, Samaras has found himself playing in a variety of positions, from winger to second striker. While at Manchester City, Sven-Goran Eriksson fielded him on the left flank, even though he protested by saying &quot;I am not a left midfielder, I am a striker and I'd like to play there.&quot;Eriksson replied that he should become more disciplined in his approach 
<br /><strong><em>Spain 5 
<br /><br />Carles Puyol 2012 Jersey</em></strong>.&quot;I don't think he should be doing so many tricks. He should be using his physical power because he is an extremely good header [of the ball],&quot; the Swede said back in the 2007-08 season.For the Greek national team, former coach Otto Rehhagel didn't hesitate in handing him the role of attacking playmaker and unsurprisingly his goalscoring tally has not been that great. In 52 international caps since 2006, he has scored only seven times and his most memorable moment is not the overhead kick in Greece's comfortable 5-2 victory over Latvia in 2009, but rather his beautiful assist for Dimitris Salpingidis, who netted the winning goal in the World Cup 2010 qualifying playoff against Ukraine.Handling all the playmaking may have been a tough feat, but he served the his country adequately in South Africa despite a first-round exit. Since then, Samaras has since resumed his creative duties for the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign under new coach Fernando Santos

For the Greek national team, Otto Rehhagel didn't hesitate to give him the role of playmaker&quot;As a youngster, Samaras was equally enamored by basketball - his favorite footballer was Marco van Basten. His sporting hero, however, was Michael Jordan, but he chose football at the age of 10 when he joined OFI Crete, where his father Giannis Samaras - a former Greek international, who currently serves as the head of Panathinaikos' academies - was playing at the time.His prodigious talent attracted the interest of numerous European clubs <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wcm9mYW5zc29jY2VyamVyc2V5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap soccer jerseys</strong></a>. His father, though, an admirer of Dutch football, brought him to Heerenveen in 2001 and a year later his son's efforts bore fruits. While only 17, Georgios broke into the club's first-team scoring three goals in his first four appearances, all as a substitute. He quickly established himself in the Eredivisie and in January 2006 booked his ticket to stardom, when Manchester City bought him for 6 million pounds, a record fee for a Greek player.However, his transfer to the Citizens proved a wrong step in his career as he failed to win a regular place in the starting lineup at Eastlands. A six-month loan spell at Celtic in 2008 provided a welcome boost in Samaras' career

Scoring a number of important goals in the Scottish side's successful title conquest forced the club to turn his loan deal permanent. Samaras has since won two more trophies with Celtic - the League Cup last season and the Scottish Premier League this term - so he heads to Euro 2012 in the best possible shape.FollowMichael Paterakis on

Dominik Hasek, attempting an NHL comeback at that age, doesn't have much interest in that logic

Hasek, a former Vezina-winning goalie who hasn't played in the NHL since 2008, wants a multiyear contract, agent Ritch Winter told Dave Davis of Kukla's Korner (via Pro Hockey Talk) 
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZmxqZXJzZXljb21tdW5pdHkuY29tL05ldy1Zb3JrLUpldHMtTkZMLUplcnNleXMtYzE0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Darrelle Revis Jets Jerseys</a></strong>.                                                                                                Dominik Hasek was known for his acrobatic saves—but those came a long time ago 
<br /><strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZmxqZXJzZXljb21tdW5pdHkuY29tL1Nhbi1GcmFuY2lzY28tNDllcnMtTkZMLUplcnNleXMtYzM0Lmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Brandon Jacobs Giants Jerseys</a></strong>. (AP Photo)                                                        Winter also said that since the Buffalo Sabres aren't interested in their former star, he's exploring deals with other teams.    Hasek was a two-time NHL MVP and won the Vezina six times. His last season as professional was with Spartak Moscow in the KHL during the 2010-11 season

Over the course of 16 NHL seasons, Hasek played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Sabres, Detroit Red Wings and Ottawa Senators.    It still seems unbelievable that Hasek has a real chance of returning in any capacity. It'd theoretically happen as a backup, though most teams' goaltending situations are already solidified. The Toronto Maple Leafs are the team most actively seeking a veteran option, but nothing suggests they'd consider Hasek.
