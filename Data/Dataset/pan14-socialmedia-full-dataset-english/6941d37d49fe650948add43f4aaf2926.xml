(AP)-Throughout most of last season, wherever Lawyer Milloy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">/</a>went, Kam Chancellor<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLW5mbC1qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjVfNjYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a> was attached.<br /><br />It was part of Chancellor’s education, required when Seattle took a chance on him as a fifth-round pick from Virginia Tech in the hopes his size and raw skills could help him develop into a potential NFL safety.<br /><br />So for nearly all of last season, Milloy had a 6-foot-3, 230-pound shadow.<br /><br />Answering the question of whether that education took hold will begin on Sunday when Seattle opens the season at San Francisco. Chancellor and free safety Earl Thomas combine to form one of the youngest safety duos around- Chancellor is just 23, while Thomas is 22.<br />It can be a difficult position being so young and yet so responsible for organizing the defense and getting veterans to listen. But Thomas and Chancellor were schooled by one of the best in Milloy.<br /><br />“I’m a guy that leads by example so i think if I’m doing the right thing and playing right, doing everything right, a guy will want to follow that, ” Chancellor said. “(It’s) just like I did following Lawyer, so i think it isn’t hard at all. ”<br /><br />In no way is Chancellor a prototypical strong safety. He has the size of a linebacker along with the background of a cornerback, having started his career at Virginia Tech originally as quarterback. He also played cornerback and rover before finally settling in at safety.<br /><br />But the experience he got during his rookie season was limited with Milloy staying healthy and playing well. Chancellor played in all 16 games, mostly on special teams, but occasionally got some time as an extra defensive back in nickel and dime packages.<br /><br />Because of his lack of playing time, it seemed likely Seattle would add a veteran presence to its defensive backfield when the lockout was lifted. It almost immediately became clear that the Seahawks believed in Chancellor’s ability to step in and take over Milloy’s role.<br /><br />Milloy even tweeted a message to Chancellor on the day training camp opened, “Make me proud bro. It’s your time!! ”<br /><br />“That’s why I end up talking about it a lot for as little as he’s done so far. I think as it is, until the guys really get out there and play, he’s not going to exert himself, ” Carroll said of Chancellor. “But once he does the things that he’s been doing on the practice field and he complements Earl Thomas<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS9qZXJzZXlzLWMtNjUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">l</a> the way they play back there, I think he’s just going to be a bigger factor. ”<br /><br />Carroll said he was impressed with hearing about Chancellor keeping in contact with players scattered all over the country during the lockout and reaching out to some of Seattle’s younger draft picks.<br /><br />It was another one of the lessons taught by Milloy, who made a point of reaching out to Thomas and Chancellor within the first days they had arrived in Seattle before the 2010 season.<br /><br />Of course, now Chancellor has to bring what Carroll’s seen in practice to the field. And his first test is hefty, trying to keep an eye on San Francisco tight end Vernon Davis while trying to figure out what the 49ers are running under new coach Jim Harbaugh.<br /><br />Thomas started right from the beginning last year. He doesn’t worry about Sunday being Chancellor’s first NFL start.<br /><br />“Kam got a little taste of what it felt like last year so I don’t think it’s that new to him, ” Thomas said. “The talking that goes on between me and him is mostly the scheme, making sure we’re on the same page. ”<br />Lawyer Milloy,Kam Chancellor,Earl Thomas,Vernon Davis,steelers jerseys<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnV5bWFya2V0LmNvbS90aW1iZXJsYW5kLWMtMjMzLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">[url=]</a>[/url]

Avtsin described how the adjustment to the smaller North American ice surface was accompanied by the experience of being away from home for the first time.<br />“I had to learn to live on my own and cook my own meals, ” Avtsin said.<br /><br />“You can tell that he’s come a long way, ” Nash said. “Seeing him in camp, he’s much more outgoing. He’s one of the guys. ”<br /><br />Nash is the latest in a series of undrafted players who have been uncovered by the Canadiens’ scouts. When he was growing up in Kamloops, B. C., he dreamt of playing in the Western Hockey League.<br /><br />“I was drafted by the Vancouver <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56b3pidXkuY29tL1dob2xlc2FsZS1EaXNjb3VudC1uZmwtZm9vdGJhbGwtamVyc2V5c19jNi5odG1s" target="_blank">Giants</a> and I went to their camp twice and I was cut, ” Nash said. “That’s when you start asking yourself whether you’d be ready to play pro at 20. I thought college would give me a chance to develop. I started when i was 19 and I was 23 when i graduated.<br /><br />“My family has also been pushing the academics, ” Nash said. “I had to make sure my homework was done before I went out to play. I was playing with Salmon Arm in the BCHL and I had offers from several schools, but when i had the chance to go to a great school like Cornell, I took it. ”<br /><br />In addition to acquiring a first-rate education, Nash had an opportunity to fill out his 6-foot-3 frame and to benefit from excellent coaching. He earned All-American honours in his senior year and, when he completed his eligibility, he signed a two-year contract with the Canadiens.<br /><br />While he’s expected to start the season in Hamilton, his stock took a small jump this week with the speculation that Andrei Markov(notes)’s debut will be delayed after a setback in his rehabilitation from offseason knee surgery. The Canadiens have two prize prospects from Europe in Raphael Diaz from Switzerland and Alexei Yemelin from Russia. The 25-year-old Yemelin has been a standout in the Kontinental Hockey League and is expected to start the season in Montreal.<br /><br />Nash has one advantage over the newcomers because he has had a taste of the NHL. If he does go back to the minors, he’ll probably head the short list of players to be recalled if for no other reason that he can give Yemelin a few English lessons.

Johnson bobbled the ball with Starlin Castro charging home. Third base umpire David Rackley immediately signaled that the ball was fair to cue a Cubs celebration.<br />“I was right over top of it, so i had a really good look, ” Johnson said. “Once I saw it hit foul I just tried to make contact with it because the ball’s dead, you know? ”<br /><br />“I’m not going to blow anybody up, really. We know the ball was foul. They’ll probably know it after looking at replays. We’ll just move on. People make mistakes. ”<br /><br />Astros manager Brad Mills came out to argue, but wasn’t screaming at the right umpire.<br /><br />“I was more concerned about who was making the call, ” he said. “It was in front of the bag and (home plate umpire Jeff Nelson) said ‘No, it was (Rackley’s) call at third base the whole way, ’ because when the bases are loaded and the guy is coming from third base coming home, it’s the other umpire’s call. So I was yelling at one guy and he didn’t have the call. ”<br /><br />A dramatic ninth-inning comeback made the loss sting even more for Houston. Cubs starter Matt Garza was one strike from finishing off a five-hitter when Carlos Lee hit his second home run of the game, a two-run shot into the left-field bleachers that tied it 3-all.<br /><br />“The two home runs allowed us to get that opportunity to hopefully win the thing in extra innings, ” Mills said. “Any time you can get a two-run homer like that to tie it up, you’d like to win the thing. ”<br /><br />Lee had three hits and three RBIs for Houston. He opened the scoring with a solo blast leading off the second.<br /><br />Lee has hit in 22 of his last 24 games, and has 23 career homers at Wrigley Field, third among active players.<br /><br />“I would say since the All-Star break, I’ve been feeling pretty good, ” he said. “I’ve found a position where I feel real comfortable and I’m seeing the ball real good. ”<br /><br />Eleven of Lee’s 18 home runs have come in the second half and he’s hitting over 25 points higher than he did in the first half.<br /><br />Garza struck out four and threw a season-high 124 pitches, allowing seven hits and no walks. Jeff Samardzija (7-4) threw a scoreless 12th to pick up the win.<br /><br />The only damage done to Garza came off of Lee’s bat.<br /><br />“It’s one of those situations where I said, ‘Here’s my best. What do you got? ’ He guessed right and beat me, ” Garza said.<br /><br />Geovany Soto led off the third with his 15th homer, and Aramis Ramirez had three hits, including his first triple of the season.<br /><br />Astros starter Wandy Rodriguez allowed three runs and six hits over 5 2-3 innings, striking out five and walking four. Reliever David Carpenter(notes) (0-3) gave up the winning run.<br /><br />“I thought Garza threw the ball well and Wandy hung right with him and threw the ball extremely well, ” Mills said.<br /><br />Rodriguez’s five strikeouts left him two shy of becoming the first Astros lefty to record 1, 000 in a career.<br /><br />The Astros swung early and often against Garza, who faced the minimum in five different innings and no more than four until the ninth. After allowing J. D. Martinez’s leadoff single in the fourth, Garza retired the next 13 Astros in order.<br /><br />Notes: Actor Martin Sheen performed during the seventh-inning stretch, singing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame. ” … The Astros will send Henry Sosa to the mound on Saturday to face Chicago’s Rodrigo Lopez.

And they’re on the USA team, obviously guys get a lot of respect, ” Philly center Jason Thompson of Sacramento said.<br /><br />“But at the end of the day, it’s not like they’re playing in a neutral place. You’re playing in Philly and in all type of sports, basketball, football, baseball, anything, you know how Philly fans get. ”<br /><br />With the NBA lockout now wiping out parts of the preseason and threatening to do more damage, Anthony helped put the game together along with his former Syracuse teammate, Hakim Warrick, and said there could be more.<br /><br />“My mindset is I’ll start next week. My body is trained, I’ll start next week and that’s where my mindset is at, that’s where my body is at, ” Anthony said. “So games like this, it’s fun. It’s charity, but at the same time, we want to get something out of it. ”<br /><br />And Warrick said for now, Philadelphia has the title of best team of the summer circuit.<br /><br />“After beating that team, I mean we’ve got to be the champs, ” the Phoenix forward said. “We’re taking on all challengers, but they’ve got to come through Philly. ”<br /><br />James had 43 points and 23 rebounds, and Anthony had 31 and 17, but Paul wasn’t in top shape in rare action during this NBA summer of inactivity. All three played all 48 minutes.<br /><br />James and Paul left without speaking to reporters.<br /><br />Former Villanova guard Kyle Lowry of the Rockets scored 34 points and Lou Williams of the hometown 76ers had 31 for Team Philly in what was called the “Battle of I-95. ” Evans finished with 18 points and 18 rebounds, and Warrick added 19 points and 12 boards.<br /><br />Fourth quarters were the problem for James in the finals, but this time his team couldn’t undo his start.<br /><br />The passionate Philly fans booed James when he came onto the floor and even louder during pregame introductions, and they were delighted when the local team threatened to run the All-Stars off the floor in the opening minutes. With speedy guards Williams, Lowry and Evans repeatedly getting by their defenders, Team Philly raced to a 22-6 lead that it extended to 35-16 later in the first quarter.<br /><br />James had only four points in the period.<br /><br />Team Melo took the lead in the final period, but Lowry led a late flurry to pull it out for Philly.<br /><br />The Melo team is based in Baltimore, but Anthony went outside his city to find James (Ohio) and Paul (North carolina).<br /><br />They were originally expected to have Kevin Durant, who’s starred in a number of these games this summer from New York to Washington, and they could have used the reinforcements. The historic gym on Penn’s campus wasn’t air conditioned, and with only three substitutes, Melo’s crew struggled to get up and down the floor at times.<br /><br />But they got better as play went on—though the previously roaring crowd became increasingly quiet as it turned into a more half-court affair until James threw down Paul’s lob pass from just inside center court to beat the halftime buzzer and cut Philly’s lead to 66-58. But Philly, with a full roster, always was able to pull far enough ahead again.<br /><br />Both teams warmed up in shirts reading “Basketball Never Stops”-but of course it has this summer in the NBA. The league announced Friday that training camps were postponed and all 43 preseason games scheduled for the week of Oct. 9-15 were canceled.<br /><br />Representatives from the NBA and players’ association hope to meet again this week but the window is tight, with the union holding a regional meeting Tuesday in Miami and some negotiators on both sides unavailable after that during the Jewish holiday, making it even tougher to agree to a deal in time to salvage any of the preseason.<br /><br />So players are forced to find ways to stay in shape without knowing when they will need to be ready for sure.<br /><br />Without the lockout, they would be entering their final week of the offseason before reporting to camp. James, Anthony and Paul have done plenty of traveling, conducting clinics and taking part in community service projects, but it’s unclear how much basketball they’ve been able to play.<br /><br />“My main thing, we just got to stick together, as players we’re sticking together, ” Anthony said, “and in the meantime keep doing stuff like this, keep having basketball games, keep playing, keep giving fans what they want. It’s not everything that they want, because they want a season, but hey, it’s something. ”<br /><br />Paul shot only 3 of 12 for six points and struggled to keep up with Philly’s speedsters.<br /><br />At halftime, organizers presented Anthony and Warrick a check for $25, 000 to build a basketball court for their cities.

''He was a guy that we were counting on this year. We traded for him, and unfortunately he's hurt.''<br />New York acquired Pineda from Seattle in January, giving up top catching prospect Jesus Montero to get the 23-year-old All-Star pitcher.<br />Pineda felt weakness in his shoulder during an extended spring training game Saturday, which came three weeks after he had problems in a spring training start. The tear was discovered in a medical exam after that.<br />When Pineda experienced discomfort in the back of the shoulder during spring training March 30, the initial diagnosis was tendon inflammation in his right shoulder.<br />Girardi said Pineda wasn't quite himself during spring training, but that the 6-foot-7, 260-pound pitcher was making his starts and doing his bullpens without any complaints of pain.<br />''He just felt like his arm was weak, so it explains why it was weak now,'' Girardi said. ''When and where and how and what we did doesn't matter now. What we have to do is more forward and try to get this kid healthy.''<br />Pineda was 9-10 with a 3.74 ERA in 171 innings last year as a rookie for the light-hitting Mariners. He's now going to miss an entire season, and possibly more.<br />''It's hard because you get a chance and you realize your dream and you have a good first year and you're looking forward to taking the things that you've learned from your first year and applying them to the second year, and you get hurt. It's a frustrating time,'' Girardi said. ''Our job is to make sure that we keep him focused on his rehab and we get him back for next year.''<br />The manager expressed optimism that Pineda would return healthy because he's young and strong.<br />''He does have youth on his side,'' Girardi said. ''And he doesn't have a ton of mileage in his arm as a younger player. That bodes well for him.''<br />The Yankees revealed the extent of Pineda's injury on the same day that 39-year-old left-hander Andy Pettitte made his third minor league start in his comeback from a one-year hiatus.<br />Pettitte allowed three earned runs and seven singles in 5-plus innings for Double-A Trenton. He struck out three and walked one, throwing 59 of his 81 pitches for strikes. Pettitte is still expected to make one or two minor league starts before possibly rejoining the Yankees.<br />Girardi said he felt the Yankees would be OK with the rotation for now because he believes ''our guys can pitch. That's the bottom line, guys just have to get it done.''<br />As for Pettitte's eventual return, Girardi feels like so many others who assume that ''Andy's going to be the Andy when he left.''
