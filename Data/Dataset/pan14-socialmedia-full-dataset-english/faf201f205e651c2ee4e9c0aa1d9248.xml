<br /><br />Q: Where can women over the age of 50 find young, sexy men, 
<br />who are interested in them? 
<br />A: Try a bookstore under fiction. 
<br /><br />Q: What can a man do while his wife is going through menopause? 
<br />A: Keep busy. If you're handy with tools, you can finish the basement. 
<br />When you are done you will have a place to live. 
<br /><br />Q: How can you increase the heart rate of your 50+ year old husband? 
<br />A: Tell him you're pregnant. 
<br /><br />Q: How can you avoid spotting a wrinkle every time you walk by a mirror? 
<br />A: The next time you're in front of a mirror, take off your glasses. 
<br /><br />Q: Why should 50+ year old people use valet parking? 
<br />A: Valets don't forget where they park your car. 
<br /><br />Q: Is it common for 50+ year olds to have problems with short term 
<br />memory storage? 
<br />A: Storing memory is not a problem, retrieving it is a problem. 
<br /><br />Q: As people age, do they sleep more soundly? 
<br />A: Yes, but usually in the afternoon. 
<br /><br />Q: Where do 50+ year olds look for fashionable glasses? 
<br />A: Their foreheads. 
<br /><br />&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt; 
<br /><br />When I was married 25 years, I took a look at my wife one day and 
<br />said, &quot;Honey, 25 years ago, we had a cheap apartment, a cheap car, 
<br />slept on a sofa bed and watched a 10-inch black and white TV, but I 
<br />got to sleep every night with a hot 25-year-old blonde.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Now, we have a nice house, nice car, big bed and plasma screen TV, 
<br />but I'm sleeping with a 50-year-old woman. It seems to me that you 
<br />are not holding up your side of things.&quot; 
<br /><br />My wife is a very reasonable woman. She told me to go out and find a 
<br />hot 25-year-old blonde, and she would make sure that I would once again 
<br />be living in a cheap apartment, driving a cheap car, sleeping on a sofa 
<br />bed and watching a 10-inch black and white TV. 
<br /><br />Aren't older women great? They really know how to solve your problems. 
<br /><br />&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt; 
<br /><br />&quot;When you look at yourself from a universal standpoint, 
<br />something inside always reminds or informs you that there 
<br />are bigger and better things to worry about.&quot; 
<br />-- Albert Einstein 
<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 
<br /><br />It is of interest to note that while some dolphins are reported to 
<br />have learned English -- up to fifty words used in correct context -- 
<br />no human being has been reported to have learned dolphinese. 
<br />-- Carl Sagan 
<br /><br />&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt;*&lt;&gt; 
<br /><br />&quot;Life's Journey&quot; is not to arrive at the grave safely in 
<br />a well preserved body, but rather to slide in sideways, 
<br />totally worn out, shouting... Holy Shit!! What a Ride!! 
<br /><br />I hope you have enjoyed our ride together thus far...

<br /><br />Her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them, and hides in the bedroom closet. Then the woman's husband also comes home.
<br /><br />She puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already.
<br /><br />The little boy says, &quot;Dark in here.&quot;
<br />The man says, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;I have a baseball.&quot;
<br />Man - &quot;That's nice.&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;Want to buy it?&quot;
<br />Man - &quot;No, thanks.&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;My dad's outside.&quot;
<br />Man - &quot;OK, how much?&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;$250&quot;
<br /><br />A few weeks later, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.
<br /><br />Boy - &quot;Dark in here.&quot;
<br />Man - &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;I have a baseball glove.&quot;
<br />The lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy, &quot;How much?&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;$750&quot;
<br />Man - &quot;Sold.&quot;
<br /><br />A few days later , the boys father says to the boy, &quot;Grab your glove and ball, let's go outside and have a game of catch. The boy says, &quot;I can't, I sold my ball and glove.&quot;
<br /><br />The father says, &quot;What?! How much did you sell them for?&quot;
<br />Boy - &quot;$1,000.&quot;
<br /><br />The father says, &quot;That's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That is far more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess.&quot;
<br /><br />They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confessional booth and he closes the door.
<br /><br />The boy says, &quot;Dark in here.&quot;
<br /><br />The priest says, &quot;Don't start that shit again. You're in my closet now.&quot;

<br />of sh*t.
<br /><br />2 I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's
<br />hard to pronounce. 
<br /><br />3 How about never? Is never good for you?
<br /><br />4 I see you've set aside this special time to
<br />humiliate yourself in public.
<br /><br />5 I'm really easy to get along with once you people
<br />learn to see it my way. 
<br /><br />6 I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.
<br /><br />7 I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a
<br />message.
<br /><br />8 I don't work here. I'm a consultant.
<br /><br />9 It sounds like English, but I can't understand a
<br />damn word you're saying. 
<br /><br />10 Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us
<br />again.
<br /><br />11 I like you. You remind me of myself when I was
<br />young and stupid.
<br /><br />12 You are validating my inherent mistrust of
<br />strangers.
<br /><br />13 I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't
<br />give a damn. 
<br /><br />14 I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your
<br />mouth.
<br /><br />15 I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I
<br />had about you.
<br /><br />16 Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by
<br />your unique point of view. 
<br /><br />17 The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean
<br />you're an artist.
<br /><br />18 Any connection between your reality and mine is
<br />purely coincidental.
<br /><br />19 What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?
<br /><br />20 I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant. 
<br /><br />21 It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma
<br />to burn off.
<br /><br />22 Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are
<br />largely ceremonial.
<br /><br />23 And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be...?
<br /><br />24 Do I look like a people person?
<br /><br />25 This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent
<br />lighting.
<br /><br />26 I started out with nothing and I still have most of
<br />it left.
<br /><br />27 Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. 
<br /><br />28 If I throw a stick, will you leave?
<br /><br />29 Errors have been made. Others will be blamed.
<br /><br />30 Whatever kind of look you were going for, you
<br />missed.
<br /><br />31 I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
<br /><br />32 A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door.
<br /><br />33 Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1?
<br /><br />34 Too many freaks, not enough circuses.
<br /><br />35 Nice perfume. Must you marinate in it?
<br /><br />36 Chaos, panic, and disorder - my work here is done.
<br /><br />37 How do I set a laser printer to stun?
<br /><br />38 I thought I wanted a career. Turns out I just
<br />wanted a salary.
<br /><br />39 Who lit the fuse on your a**?
<br /><br />40 Oh I get it... like humour... but different.

<br />Hubby and I had to have the garage door repaired. The
<br />Sears repairman told us that one of our problems was that we did not 
<br />have a &quot;large&quot; enough motor on the opener. I thought for a minute, and said 
<br />that we had the largest one Sears made at that time, a 1/2 horsepower. He 
<br />shook his head and said, &quot;Lady, you need a 1/4 horsepower.&quot; I responded that 
<br />1/2 was larger than 1/4. He said, &quot;NO, it's not. Four is larger than two.&quot; 
<br />We haven't used Sears repair since.

<br />I live in a semi rural area. We recently had a new neighbor call the local township 
<br />administrative office to request the removal of the Deer Crossing sign on our road. 
<br />The reason: &quot; Too many deer are being hit by cars out here! I don't think this is a good
<br />place for them to be crossing anymore.&quot;

<br />My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked the person 
<br />behind the counter for &quot;minimal lettuce.&quot; He said he was sorry, but they only had iceberg. 
<br />He was a Chef?
<br />Yep...From Kansas City !

<br />IDIOT SIGHTING! : 
<br />I was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport employee asked, &quot;Has 
<br />anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?&quot; To which I replied, 
<br />&quot;If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?&quot; He smiled knowingly and nodded, 
<br />&quot;That's why we ask.&quot;
<br />Happened in Birmingham , Ala.

<br />IDIOT SIGHTING: 
<br />The stoplight on the corner buzzes when its safe to cross the street. I was crossing 
<br />with an intellectually challenged coworker of mine. She asked if I knew what the 
<br />buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when the light is red. 
<br />Appalled, she responded, &quot;What on earth are blind people doing driving?!&quot; 
<br />She was a probation officer in Wichita , KS

<br />IDIOT SIGHTING: 
<br />At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear coworker:  She was leaving the company 
<br />due to &quot;downsizing.&quot; Our manager commented cheerfully, &quot;This is fun. 
<br />We should do this more often.&quot; Not another word was spoken. We all just looked 
<br />at each other with that deer-in-the-headlights stare.
<br />This was a bunch at Texas Instruments.

<br />IDIOT SIGHTING: 
<br />When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealer-shi p to pick up our car, 
<br />we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service department 
<br />and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver's side door. 
<br />As I watched from the passenger side, I instinctively tried the door handle and 
<br />discovered that it was unlocked. &quot;Hey,&quot; I announced to the technician, &quot;Its open!&quot; His
<br />reply, &quot;I know - I already got that side.&quot;
<br />This was at the Ford dealership in Canton , Mississippi !

<br />to be very strong in heart, are really
<br />weak and most susceptible?
<br /><br />Did you know that those who spend
<br />their time protecting others are the
<br />ones that really need someone to
<br />protect them?
<br /><br />Did you know that the three most
<br />difficult things to say are:
<br />â€¢ I love you.
<br />â€¢ Iâ€™m sorry.
<br />â€¢ Help me.
<br /><br />Did you know that those who dress
<br />in red are more confident in
<br />themselves?
<br />Did you know that those who dress
<br />in yellow are those that enjoy their
<br />beauty?
<br /><br />Did you know that those who dress
<br />in black, are those who want to be
<br />unnoticed and need your help and
<br />understanding?
<br /><br />Did you know that when you help
<br />someone, the help is returned in two
<br />folds?
<br /><br />Did you know that it's easier to say
<br />what you feel in writing than saying
<br />it to someone in the face? But did
<br />you know that it has more value
<br />when you say it to their face?
<br /><br />Did you know that if you ask for
<br />something in faith, your wishes are
<br />granted?
<br /><br />Did you know that you can make
<br />your dreams come true, like falling in
<br />love, becoming rich, staying healthy,
<br />if you ask for it by faith, and if you
<br />really knew, you'd be surprised by
<br />what you could do.
<br /><br />But don't believe everything I tell
<br />you, until you try it for yourself, if
<br />you know someone that is in need of
<br />something that I mentioned, and you
<br />know that you can help, you'll see
<br />that it will be returned in two-fold.
