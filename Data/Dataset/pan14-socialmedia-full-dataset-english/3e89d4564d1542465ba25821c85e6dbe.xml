Nothing can be more enthralling than discovering the charm of the world’s mega city, New York on a USA Tour plan. The New York City, consisting of five boroughs: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Staten Island, is located on a vast natural harbor on the Atlantic coast. The iconic names of places synonymous to New York City are the Statue of Liberty, The Times Square and the Wall Street. The other major attractions of the city are the Empire State Building, The Rockefeller Centre, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Arts (MoMA), The Rose Centre for Earth and Space, The Intrepid Museum, The Ellis Island, the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), the Central Park and the Staten Island.
<br /><br />The American symbol of freedom towering the city is the great Statue of Liberty or the Liberty Enlightening the World on Liberty Island. When on a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50b3B0b3VycGFja2FnZXMuY29t" target="_blank">USA Tour</a>, this colossal sculpture of a robed female representing the Roman Goddess of Freedom with a torch and a tablet evoking law, is a must-see. The Statue of Liberty welcomed millions of immigrants to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The hustle and bustle of the New York City is concentrated on its landmark destinations: Times Square or 
<br />“The Crossroads of the World” and Wall Street. The former, located in Manhattan, is the major hub for the entertainment industry; while the later, located in Lower Manhattan, is the financial centre of the city which houses the New York Stock Exchange.
<br /><br />Other best places to visit in New York while on USA Holidays are many. The 102 story skyscraper, The Empire State Building, is the tallest building of New York and the third tallest skyscraper in the United States. It has been named ‘the Seven Wonders of the Modern World’ by the American Society of Civil Engineers. An all time favorite tourist attraction is The Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan known for its Radio City Music Hall and the Top of The Rock Observation Deck. The GE Building offers an unobstructed breathtaking landscape view of the New York City from its 70th floor! Your USA Tour is incomplete without exploring the innumerable universities and museums around the city. The grand Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Arts are storehouses of work of art from around the world. On the other hand, The Rose Centre for Earth and Space and the Intrepid Museum are the new state-of-the-art centers of technological excellence. The Ellis Island Immigration Museum throws an insight into the challenges experienced by the immigrants while passing through the Ellis Island.
<br /><br />However on USA Holidays when you have enough of the skyscrapers and the hustle and bustle of the city life, you can simply escape to the greener pastures in and around New York like the New York Botanical Garden in Bronx, The Central Park in central Manhattan, the Coney Island in south Brooklyn or the suburban Staten Island. A popular tourist attraction is the Staten Island Ferry which offers a panoramic view of the city landmarks. 
<br />Last but not the least; your USA Holidays is never complete without indulging on a shopping spree at Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, 57th Street etc. in New York.
