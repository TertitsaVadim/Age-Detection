One of the main reasons for this is that it serves as a perfect crossover instrument to move on to playing a flute or a saxophone later on. To add to it, its small size and lightweight has made it a popular instrument among children as well. Whether you are planning to buy your first clarinet or a step-up instrument, you need to consider some important factors at the time of making a purchase. Anytime you step into a musical instrument store, you will find a wide collection of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kb21pbmljc211c2ljLmNvbS93b29kd2luZHMvY2xhcmluZXRz" target="_blank">clarinets</a> on display. In order to make the right buying decision, you should pay attention to the critical features as well as the main components of this instrument. 
<br /><br />First things first, you need to fix a budget for your purchase. This will help you narrow down your choices when you hit a store to buy the instrument. Most brand name clarinets are priced between four hundred and one thousand dollars. If you have a budget of more than four hundred dollars, it would be best to buy a new clarinet of a well-known brand. However, if you have a shoestring budget, you can opt for a used clarinet or take one on a monthly rent. Most clarinets are made of either wood or plastic. Those made of plastic may not be of high quality but are lighter on the pocket. At the same time, they are sturdier than their wooden counterparts that are more prone to damage, especially when exposed to extremes of temperature. However, a wood clarinet sounds more appealing than one made of plastic. 
<br /><br />Ideally, a plastic clarinet is better suited for children who have just begun taking clarinet lessons, while a wood clarinet is a perfect choice for adults who want to hone their musical talent. While buying a clarinet, do not forget to buy various accessories that you will need to play and maintain this instrument. For instance, you need to buy cleaning swabs and cork grease to disinfect the instrument before every session. To add to it, you need to buy clarinet reeds as well that are used as a tone generator for the instrument. Make sure that you make a provision for these accessories in your budget. Clarinets, both old and new, come with both warranties and guarantees, and make sure that you ask the retailer about the same at the time of purchase.
