<br />we learn that even the 1 person that wasn't supposed 2 ever let u down probably will. 
<br />U'll have ur heart broken probably more than once n it's harder every time. 
<br />U'll break hearts 2, so remember how it felt when urs was broken. 
<br />U'll fight wiv ur best friend. 
<br />U'll blame a new love 4 things an old 1 did. 
<br />U'll cry bcoz time is passing 2 fast, 
<br />n u'll eventually lose some1 u love. 
<br />So take 2 many pictures, laugh 2 much, n love like u've never been hurt bcoz every 60 seconds u spend upset is a minute of happiness u'll never get back. 
<br />Don't b afraid that ur life will end, 
<br />b afraid that it will never begin.

<br />right and you need to shut up.
<br /><br />2.) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour. 
<br />Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more
<br />minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.
<br /><br />3.) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something,
<br />and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually
<br />end in fine.
<br /><br />4.) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission. Don't Do It!
<br /><br />5.) Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement 
<br />often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot
<br />and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you
<br />about nothing. (Refer back to #3 for the meaning of nothing.) 
<br /><br />6.) That's Okay: This is one of the ! most dangerous statements a women
<br />can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard before
<br />deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. 
<br /><br />7.) Thanks: A woman is thanking you, do not question, or Faint. Just say
<br />you're welcome.
<br /><br />8.) Whatever: Is a women's way of saying
<br />F**K U!
<br /><br />9.) Don't worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning
<br />this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is 
<br />now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking &quot;What's
<br />wrong?&quot; For the woman's response refer to #3.
<br /><br />this is for the men , to warn them about arguments they can
<br />avoid if they remember the terminology.
<br /><br />this is for to all the women to give them a good laugh, cause they
<br />know it's true.

<br /><br />Girl is on the couch making out with a hot guy, her cellphone rings...
<br /><br />Girl:Hey babe, I'll be right back. I need to take this call.
<br /><br />Boy: Yeah okay. Sure.
<br /><br />She walks into the next room.
<br /><br />Girl: Hey! What's up?
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Nothing, hey hun, do you think we could go do something later tonight? What are the chances my boss let me get out early.
<br /><br />Girl: Yeah, sounds great!
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Okay. I'm right by your house, I'll come to get you now.
<br /><br />Girl: That's not such a good idea...
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: Why not?
<br /><br />Girl: I'm busy right now... sorry.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: With what? It's our anniversary! You didn't make any other plans did you...?
<br />In her head she yells, CRAP! Throws clothes back on quickly.
<br /><br />Girl: No No... I was just eating... with the family.
<br /><br />Guy [on her cellphone]: But I thought you said your family was away this weekend, up at your resort?
<br /><br />The guy walks into her house, turns the corner into the hallway. Goes downstairs, and finds his best friend on her couch, half un-dressed, trying to pull his pants back on and his girlfriend pulling her shirt over her head.
<br /><br />Guy: What the heck is going on?!
<br /><br />Girl: I can explain! Please listen to me!
<br /><br />Guy: Benny? How could you do this to me! Rachel! I thought you loved me! And yet, your sleeping with MY BEST FRIEND!!!!
<br /><br />Girl: John...!
<br /><br />John with tears in his eyes, he rushes out of room, and slams the door.
<br /><br />Benny climbs out of the window, starts his car, and drives off down the street.
<br /><br />Girl runs after her boyfriend. Yelling....
<br /><br />Girl: NOOOO! Please!! Come back John!! Pleeeeeasssse????!! She falls down and cries.
<br /><br />John turns around, looks straight at his girlfriend in tears.
<br /><br />John: Why? Rachel, why? I loved you! Oh my God, I'm in love with a whore. Does this mean I have to pay you now?!
<br />Here take this as the cash. He drops a ring box on her lap.
<br /><br />She opens the ring box. Her jaw drops... Before her eyes is a diamond wedding ring.
<br /><br />Girl: You were going to propose?
<br /><br />Guy: Yeah... how dumb was I? And as he slowly walked back to his car, his headlights faded... And she was in despair.
<br /><br />Later that night, the girl got a phone call from the police saying he had died of an overdose of drugs and when they found him he had a picture of him and her in his hands
<br /><br />If you love/like someone, and you want them in your life forever. Repost in 380 seconds as &quot;cheating hurts.&quot; Or your true love will walk away from you
<br /><br />Did you no that every night b4 u go to sleep there is 1 person of the opposite sex thinking of you. they want 2 kiss u, they want 2 b with u, they r always thinking about u, this is all true and not fake. if u repost this in 5 min the person that is longing to b with u will approach u within 1 month and ask u out or grab you and kiss u. but if u break this chain no 1 will like u or ask u out again for 5 years
