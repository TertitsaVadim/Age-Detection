<br /><br />Cricket stars coming to town
<br />Steve Spinks | 13th June 2009

<br />Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting.
<br /><br />AAP
<br />AUSTRALIA'S Ashes players will be available for part of Lismore's Festival of Cricket in September despite only just finishing a draining campaign in England, it was revealed yesterday at the official launch of the event at Oakes Oval.
<br /><br />As part of the agreement between the Lismore City Council and the State Associations of NSW, Victoria and Tasmania, Australian cricketers including captain Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, Brett Lee and Brad Haddin will be obligated to attend the September 22 to 30 event.
<br /><br />Complete Sports Marketing director Rick Sleeman, who helped finalise the deal for the council, said the tournament had the full backing of Cricket Australia.
<br /><br />“The State Associations in the letter of agreement said they would send their best sides,” Sleeman said.
<br /><br />“This includes the players back from the Ashes.
<br /><br />“They get back to Australia on the Tuesday, when the Lismore event starts, and will be up here by Friday to start commencing their duties with their State sides.
<br /><br />“It really will be the best of the best coming to Lismore.
<br /><br />“This is a new and innovative idea that Cricket Australia is keen to pursue with the other three States not coming.
<br /><br />“This is a first and Lismore should feel proud as they have been selected as the place to hold the inaugural event.”
<br /><br />Sleeman indicated that if crowd numbers are healthy enough the event could be an ongoing proposition.
<br /><br />The CSM boss also said Lismore will host an Australian Cricketers Association event as a finale to the eight-day tournament.
<br /><br />The ACA game will involve a minimum of seven former Test match players and possibly a smattering of younger players knocking on the door of State selection playing a North Coast team selected by Cricket NSW.
<br /><br />“It will typically be people that Cricket NSW believe are most likely to become first-class players from this region,” Sleeman said.
<br /><br />“A scholarship of $2500 will be offered and the former Test players will also take part in a sportsmen's night.
<br /><br />“They will also go out into the community and hold clinics for kids. It's designed to foster relations between cricket and the community.
<br /><br />“The players you see could be the likes of Ian Healy, Rodney Hogg and Lenny Pascoe.
<br /><br />“The ACA are committed to providing a team that smacks the ball out of the park; they still really love their cricket.”
<br /><br />The clinics are scheduled for October 1, directly after the last Twenty20 match on September 30, with the match between the former Test players and the local young guns tentatively booked for October 2 at Oakes Oval.
<br /><br />Costs involved
<br />Meanwhile, Lismore City Council events co-ordinator John Bancroft has revealed the Festival of Cricket will cost between $70,000 to $80,000 to stage.
<br /><br />“It's a step up for council because this time we are the promoter so every person that goes through the gate the money comes to us,” he said.
<br /><br />“We have to accommodate the players and fly them here and prepare the wickets and staffing and things like that so the budget is between $70,000 to $80,000.
<br /><br />“We have budgeted on ticket sales to cover that of between 700 to 1000 people a day and that will give us a profit.
<br /><br />“It's a very conservative crowd figure and if we sell out on just one night and get between 5000 to 8000 people the event will pay for itself.”
<br /><br />Bancroft said seating prices had yet to be determined but that premium seats would likely go for between $20 to $25 and outer seats for $12 to $15.
<br /><br />An on-line ticketing system is being set up with tickets expected to be available from August.
<br /><br />The council has also released a preliminary program for the event with the feature being four matches under lights.
<br /><br />The nine-day event starts on Tuesday, September 22, with NSW and Victoria playing a one-day 50-over match from 2pm to 10pm.
<br /><br />Wednesday sees NSW meet Tasmania in a 50-over match.
<br /><br />Thursday has Victoria playing Tasmania in the final 50-over match.
<br /><br />Friday will be the first Twenty20 game between Tasmania and Victoria.
<br /><br />Saturday will be the feature match with NSW playing Victoria from 3pm to 7pm.
<br /><br />And Sunday is set for NSW and Tasmania to play a Twenty20 game from 1pm to 5pm.
<br /><br />Monday will be a corporate golf day with NSW and Victoria playing further matches on Tuesday and Wednesday before the teams depart on Thursday.
<br /><br />The only problems with the draw will be a clash on September 24 when a 50-over match between Victoria and Tasmania is scheduled up against the Lismore Cup.
<br /><br />Bancroft said the council is already in discussions to amend the draw so that the events will not compete for spectators.
<br /><br />Lismore Turf Club secretary-manager Michael Timbrell said his organisation would work with the council on a variety of options to include the cricketers in Lismore's biggest event.</strong></span>

<br /><br />DO NOT DELETE
<br /><br />ESPECIALLY LADIES PLEEEESE READ THIS
<br /><br />-
<br /><br />Because of recent abductions 
<br />In daylight hours, refresh yourself 
<br />of these things to do in an emergency 
<br /><br />situation... 
<br />This is for you,  and for you to share 
<br />with your wife, your children, 
<br />everyone you know. 
<br />After reading these 9 crucial tips, 
<br />forward them to someone you care about. 
<br />It never hurts to be careful
<br /><br />in this crazy world we live in. 
<br />1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do : 
<br />The elbow is the strongest point 
<br />on your body. 
<br />If you are close enough to use it, do! 
<br />2... Learned this from a tourist guide. 
<br />If a robber asks  for your wallet and/or purse, 
<br />DO NOT HAND IT TO HIM. 
<br />Toss it away from you.... 
<br />Chances are  that he is more interested 
<br />in your wallet and/or purse than you,  and he will gofor the wallet/purse. 
<br />RUN LIKE MAD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION! 
<br /><br />3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, 
<br />kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy...... 
<br />The driver won't20see you, but everybody else will.. 
<br />This has saved lives. 
<br />4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars 
<br />after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit 
<br />(doing their chequebook, or making a list, etc.) 
<br />DON'T DO THIS! 
<br />The predator  will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side,  put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go. 
<br />AS SOON AS YOU GET INTO YOUR CAR , 
<br />LOCK THE DOORS AND LEAVE... 
<br /><br />If someon e is in the car 
<br />with a gun to your head 
<br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF, 
<br />Repeat: 
<br />DO NOT DRIVE OFF! 
<br />INSTEAD gun the engine ! 
<br />and speed into anything, wrecking the car. 
<br />Your Air Bag will save you. 
<br />If the person is in the back seat 
<br />they will get the worst of it ! 
<br /><br />As soon as the car crashes 
<br />bail out and run. 
<br />It is better than having them find your body in a remote location. 
<br /><br />5. A few notes about getting 
<br />into your car in a parking lot, 
<br />or parking garage: 
<br />A.) Be aware: 
<br />look around you, 
<br />look into your car, 
<br />at the passenger side floor , 
<br />and in the back seat 
<br />B.) If you are parked next to a big van, 
<br />enter your car from the passenger door. 
<br />Most serial killers attack their victims 
<br />by pulling them into their vans while the women 
<br />are attempting to get into their cars. 
<br />C..) Look at the car 
<br />parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, 
<br />and the passenger side... If a male is sitting alone 
<br />in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back 
<br />into the mall, or work, and get a 
<br />guard/policeman to walk you back out. 
<br />IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY. (And better paranoid than dead.) 
<br /><br />6. ALWAYS take the elevator 
<br />instead of the stairs. 
<br />Stairwells are horrible places to be alone 
<br />and the perfect crime spot. 
<br />This is especially true at NIGHT!) 
<br />7. If the predator has a gun 
<br />and you are not under his control, 
<br />ALWAYS RUN! 
<br />The predator will only hit you (a running target) 
<br />4 in 100 times; and even then, 
<br />it most likely WILL NOT be a vital organ. 
<br />RUN, Preferably in a zig -zag pattern! 
<br />8. As women, we are always trying 
<br />to be sympathetic: 
<br />STOP 
<br />It may get you raped, or killed. 
<br />Ted Bundy,&lt;/ B&gt; the serial killer, was a good-looking, 
<br />well educated man, who ALWAYS played 
<br />on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. 
<br />He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often 
<br />asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, 
<br />which is when he abducted 
<br />his next victim. 
<br />9. Another Safety Point: 
<br />Someone just told me that her friend heard 
<br />a crying baby on her porch the night before last, 
<br />and she called the police because it was late 
<br />and she thought it was weird.. The police told her 
<br />'Whatever you do, DO NOT 
<br />open the door..' 
<br />The lady then said that it sounded like the baby 
<br />had crawled near a window, and she was worried 
<br />that it would crawl to the street and get run over. 
<br />The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way, 
<br />whatever you do, DO NOT open the door.' 
<br />He told her that they think a serial killer 
<br />has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax 
<br />women out of their homes thinking that someone 
<br />dropped off a baby. He said they have not verified it,
<br />but have had several calls by women saying that 
<br />they hear baby's cries outside their doors 
<br />when they're home alone at night. 
<br /><br />10. Water scam! 
<br />If you wake up in the middle
<br />of the night to hear all your taps outside running or what you think is a burst pipe, DO NOT GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE! These people turn on all your outside taps full ball so that you will go out to investigate and
<br />then attack.
<br /><br />Stay alert, keep safe, and look out for your neighbours! 
<br />Please pass this on 
<br />This e-mail should probably be taken seriously because 
<br />the Crying Baby Theory was mentioned on 
<br />America 's Most Wanted when they profiled 
<br />the serial killer in Louisiana 
<br /><br />I'd like you to forward this to all the women you know. 
<br />It may save a life. A candle is not dimmed by lighting another candle.. 
<br />I was going to send this to the ladies only, 
<br />but guys, if you love your mothers, wives, sisters,daughters, etc., you may want to pass it onto them, as well. 
<br /><br />Send this to any woman you know that may need 
<br />to be reminded that the world we live in has a lot of crazies in it and it's better to be safe than sorry.. 
<br />Everyone should take 5 minutes to read this. It may save your life or love one's life
