<br /><br />************ ********* *
<br />Whatever you give away today, or think or say or do will multiply about tenfold and then return to you. It may not come immediately, nor from the obvious source but the law applies unfailingly, through some invisible force. 
<br /><br />Whatever you feel about another, be it love or hate or passion will surely bounce right back to you in some clear (or secret) fashion If you speak about some person, a word of praise or two, soon, tens of other people will speak kind words of you. 
<br /><br />Our thoughts are broadcasts of the soul, not secrets of the brain. Kind ones bring us happiness; petty ones, untold pain. Giving works as surely as reflections in a mirror. 
<br /><br />If hate you send, hate you'll get back, but loving brings love nearer. 
<br /><br />Lesson to learn from This Mail &quot; 
<br /><br />Remember, as you start this day and duty crowds your mind, that kindness comes so quickly back to those who first are kind. Let that thought and this one direct us through each day. 
<br /><br />The only things we ever keep are the things we give away.

<br /><br />What is maturity ? Maturity is the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Maturity is patience. It is the willingness to pass up immediate pleasure in favor of the long-term gain. Maturity is perseverance, the ability to sweat out a project or a situation in spite of heavy opposition and discouraging set-backs. Maturity is the capacity to face unpleasantness and frustration, discomfort and defeat, without complaint or collapse. Maturity is humility. It is being big enough to say, &quot;I was wrong.&quot; And, when right, the mature person need not experience the satisfaction of saying, &quot;I told you so.&quot; 
<br />Maturity is the ability to make a decision and stand by it. The immature spend their lives exploring endless possibilities; then they do nothing. 
<br />Maturity means dependability, keeping one's word, coming through in a crisis. The immature are masters of the alibi. They are the confused and the disorganized. Their lives are a maze of broken promises, former friends, unfinished business, and good intentions that somehow never materialize. 
<br />Maturity is the art of living in peace with that which we cannot change, the courage to change that which should be changed -- and the wisdom to know the difference. 
<br /><br />what you think about it.....

<br />In the journal paper of my heart,
<br />I have written a journal entry.
<br />Debiting your love and your affection.
<br />Darling you write the narration,
<br />Your first love, I had already adjusted
<br />On the ledger-folio column,
<br />Any way our relations are true assets
<br />On double-entry system
<br />In addition, our love is true real and tangible
<br />You debit-what comes in,
<br />I credit-what goes out.
<br />Your beauty is the capital of business.
<br />My eyes are stock in trade.
<br />Let us enter into transaction,
<br />You secretly give me a trade discount,
<br />I openly give you a cash discount
<br />And thus my partner,
<br />Our trading and profit-loss account will show super profit
<br />My dear let us re-concile,
<br />all our errors and total the trial balance of our affairs
<br />arithmetically without maintaining any suspense account.
<br />In the balance sheet of our life
<br />Our children will be our true assets and liabilities
<br />If they are boys, they will be our sundry debtors
<br />If they are girls, they will be our sundry creditors
<br />But if we have a boy and a girl,
<br />Our balance sheet will tally automatically.

<br /><br />Many people will walk in and out of your life.
<br />But only true friends will leave footprints in your heart.
<br />To handle yourself, use your head;
<br />To handle others, use your heart.
<br /><br />Friends
<br /><br />Anger is only one letter short of danger
<br />If someone betrays you once, it is his fault;
<br />If he betrays you twice, it is your fault.
<br /><br />Great minds discuss ideas;
<br />Average minds discuss events;
<br />Small minds discuss people.
<br /><br />He, who loses money, loses much;
<br />He, who loses a friend, loses much more;
<br />He, who loses faith, loses all.
<br /><br />Beautiful young people are accidents of nature,
<br />But beautiful old people are works of art.
<br /><br />Learn from the mistakes of others
<br />You can't live long enough to make them all
<br />yourself.
<br /><br />Friends, you and me...
<br />You brought another friend...
<br />And then there were 3...
<br />We started our group...
<br />Our circle of friends...
<br />And like that circle...
<br />There is no beginning or end...
<br /><br />Yesterday is history.
<br />Tomorrow is mystery.
<br />Today is a gift.
<br />That is why it is called the present.
<br /><br />Show your friends how much you care...
<br />Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND.
<br />If it comes back to you, then you'll know you
<br />have a circle of friends.

<br />&quot;Before I sleep and after I wake up and all the hours in between ... you occupy my mind. So, practically every moment of the day you are in my thoughts. I MISS YOU.
<br />It's true we don't know what we've got until its gone, but we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.&quot;
<br />&quot;I did three things today; miss you, miss you, and miss you.&quot;
<br /><br />Each time I miss you, a star falls down from the sky. So, if you looked up at the sky and found it dark with no stars, it is all your fault. You made me miss you too much!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Missing someone gets easier everyday because even though you are one day further from the last time you saw them, you are one day closer to the next time you will.&quot; 
<br /><br />Distance never separates two hearts that really care, for our memories span the miles and in seconds we are there. But whenever I start feeling sad, because I miss you, I remind myself how lucky I am to have someone so special to miss.&quot; 
<br />Cause I love you and I miss you, hearing your voice is the closest thing to touching youâ€¦&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;To me you are my rose; every day when I see a beatiful rose I think of you, and miss you, and hope to hold you in my arms.&quot; 
<br /><br />When the night has come and the land's dark, when the moon is the only light we'll see, look at the stars; can you count them? I miss you that much.&quot; 
<br /><br />Sometimes I miss you so much, I just want to rip you out of my dreams and hug you!&quot; 
<br /><br />When I miss you, I don't have to go far ... I just have to look inside my heart because that's where I'll find you.&quot; 
<br /><br />A hug for you means I need you. A kiss for you means I love you. A call for you means I'm missing you.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Where you used to be, there is a hole in the world, which I find myself constantly walking around in the daytime, and falling in at night. I miss you like hell.&quot; 
<br /><br />I miss you like the sun misses the flowers, like the sun misses the flowers in the depths of winter, instead of beauty to direct it's light to, the heart hardens like the frozen world which your absence has banished me to.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;How blue can I get, you could ask my heart. Just like a jugsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart. A million words couldn't say just how I feel. A million years from now, you know, I'll be loving you still. The nights are lonely, the days are so sad and I just keep thinkin' about the love that we had. And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;I don't want you to know, so I try to be strong. I don't want you to think that without you, I can't go on. But that's how it is, and that's how it will be, because, Baby, I love you, I need you, I miss you, and without you, there's just no me.&quot;

<br />And I don’t know what to do
<br />How many cards to buy and send 
<br />To the good looking people
<br />It’s quite funny
<br />they never ever send me any? 
<br /><br />Every year it’s the same
<br />Being asked the question
<br />How many did u get?
<br />I lie 
<br />and say I got over twenty
<br />Sent most of them to myself 
<br /><br />Not into religion much
<br />Aint got time and I am too busy
<br />more time for that stuff when I’m older 
<br />but every Valentine ’s Day 
<br />I buy and send cards
<br />Didn’t realise that I was a practicing pagan
<br />Worshipping Satan
<br />Instead of my religion Islam
<br /><br />I go with the flow
<br />And the flow goes westwards
<br />Live life based on desires
<br />No fear for the hell fire
<br />Religion is just a joke
<br />In this modern age of technology
<br /><br />Desires satisfied
<br />But always more to do
<br />Humans are pretty
<br />When u get one 
<br />The one u don’t have seems desirable
<br />Always the opportunity cost
<br />And sometimes u feels lost
<br />And spoilt for choice
<br /><br />Who shall I date?
<br />And have as my mate
<br />Coz Feb fourteen only comes once a year
<br />Full of fear
<br />As I ask out a nice girly
<br />Is she taken or playing hard to get
<br />Get my wallet out 
<br />and she’s mine without a doubt
<br /><br />Cash always works
<br />And the promise of a good time
<br />Better than the last one she was with
<br />Hope she’s not too experienced
<br />With a good memory
<br />Hate comparisons
<br />But that’s just the way it goes
<br /><br />In this day and age
<br />Changing partners every few months
<br />It’s all the rage
<br />Me and her both
<br />Also being careful
<br />Not be caught by the family
<br />Otherwise
<br />It’s the arranged marriage route
<br />for her and maybe for me
<br />Honour and all that
<br />But we both lost ours years ago 
<br /><br />I like women’s equality 
<br />Any excuse to go all the way
<br />Hope she don’t get pregnant
<br />Or pass me any diseases
<br />Asian girls are cleaner
<br />Compared to the others
<br />So I don’t bother with protection
<br /><br />Feb fourteen
<br />Is all about following St Valentine
<br />Dating and mating
<br />Not debating
<br />Serious issues
<br />As I pursue my prey
<br />All the way
<br /><br />practice being a pagan 
<br />For just one day
<br />Even if it means
<br />Catching diseases
<br />Loss of honour and respect
<br />And being caught by the family

<br /><br />Too often we don't realize
<br />what we have until it is gone;
<br />Too often we wait too late to say
<br />&quot;I'm sorry - I was wrong.&quot;
<br />Sometimes it seems we hurt the ones
<br />we hold dearest to our hearts;
<br />And we allow foolish things
<br />to tear our lives apart.
<br /><br />Far too many times we let
<br />unimportant things into our minds;
<br />And then it's usually too late
<br />to see what made us blind.
<br /><br />So be sure that you let people know
<br />how much they mean to you;
<br />Take that time to say the words
<br />before your time is through.
<br /><br />Be sure that you appreciate
<br />everything you've got
<br />And be thankful for the

<br />You can never see her without her handphone. In fact she also changed

<br />(just imagine their love) . Before she passed away she always told her 
<br />friends &quot;If I pass away please burn me with my handphone&quot; she also said 
<br />the same thing to her parents.
<br /><br />After her death, people cant carry her coffin, I was there. A lot of 
<br />them tried to do so but still cant , everybody including me, had tried to 
<br />carry the coffin, the result is still the same. Eventually, they called 
<br />their neighbour, a &quot;bomoh&quot; from Thailand (pak Darin), who is a friend 
<br />of her father. He took a stick and started speaking to himself slowly. 
<br />After a few minutes, he said &quot;this girl misses something here&quot;. then her 
<br />friends told Darin about her intentions to burn her with her phone. He 
<br />then opened the coffin and place her phone and SIM card inside the 
<br />casket. after that they tried to carry the coffin. It could be moved and 
<br />they carried it into the van easily. All of us were shocked.
<br /><br />Priya's parents did not inform Shankar that Priya had passed away. 
<br />After 2 weeks Shankar called Priya's mom. Shankar :....&quot;Atte, I'm coming 
<br />home today. Cook something nice for me. Dont tell Priya that I'm coming 
<br />home today, I wanna surprise her.&quot; Her mother replied.....&quot;You come home 
<br />first, I wanna tell you something very important.&quot; after he came, they 
<br />told him the truth about Priya.
<br /><br />Shankar thinks that they were playing a fool. He was laughing and said 
<br />&quot;don't try to fool me - tell Priya to come out, I have a gift for her 
<br />Please stop this nonsense&quot;. then they show him the original death 
<br />certificate to him. They gave him proof to make him believe. (Shankar started 
<br />to sweat) ..
<br /><br />He said... &quot;Its not true. we spoke yesterday. She still calls me. 
<br />Shankar was shaking. Suddenly, Shankar's phone rang. &quot;see this is from 
<br />Priya, see this...&quot; he showed the phone to priya's family. all of them told 
<br />him to answer. he talked using the loudspeaker mode. all of them heard 
<br />his conversation.
<br /><br />Loud and clear, no cross lines, no humming. It is the actual voice of 
<br />Priya &amp; there is no way others could use her SIM card since it is nailed 
<br />inside the coffin they were so shocked and asked for pak Darin's help 
<br />again. pak Darin brought his master (tok Chen) to solve this matter. He 
<br />&amp; Darin worked for 5 hours. Then they discovered one thing... Hutch has 
<br />the best coverage. Wherever you go, their network follows!!!
