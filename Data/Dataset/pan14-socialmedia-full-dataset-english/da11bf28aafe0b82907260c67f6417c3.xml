<br />that you keep contemplating over and over inside your mind...
<br /><br />There is no place you can venture where your true emotions
<br />will be concealed and the secrets of your heart will not show...
<br /><br />There is no place in this whole wide world you can travel
<br />to where your spirit does not direct or guide you towards your destiny...
<br /><br />Life is the experience of being you;
<br />no one can ever be someone other than who they are...
<br /><br />The beauty found in each and every person is the essence of life...
<br />Simply ... you are who you are and for whatever time you have to be,
<br /><br />You must not try to shadow yourself,
<br />but, rather, express yourself...

<br />When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.
<br /><br />When someone is in your life for a REASON,
<br />it is usually to meet a need
<br />you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.
<br />They have come to assist you through a difficulty,
<br />to provide you with guidance and support,
<br />to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually.
<br />They may seem like a godsend, and they are.
<br />They are there for the reason you need them to be.
<br /><br />Then, without any wrong doing on your part
<br />or at an inconvenient time,
<br />this person will say or do something
<br />to bring the relationship to an end.
<br />Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.
<br />Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.
<br /><br />What we must realize is that our need has been met,
<br />our desire fulfilled; their work is done.
<br />The prayer you sent up has been answered
<br />and it is now time to move on.
<br /><br />When people come into your life for a SEASON,
<br />it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.
<br />They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh.
<br />They may teach you something you have never done.
<br />They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.
<br />Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season.
<br /><br />LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons;
<br />those things you must build upon
<br />in order to have a solid emotional foundation.
<br />Your job is to accept the lesson,
<br />love the person/people (anyway);
<br />and put what you have learned to use in all
<br />other relationships and areas of your life.
<br /><br />It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

<br />Once shrieked as Kosciusko fell; 
<br />On every wind, indeed, that blows 
<br />    I hear her yell.
<br /><br />She screams whenever monarchs meet, 
<br />And parliaments as well, 
<br />To bind the chains about her feet 
<br />    And toll her knell.
<br /><br />And when the sovereign people cast 
<br />The votes they cannot spell, 
<br />Upon the lung-impested blast 
<br />    Her clamors swell.
<br /><br />For all to whom the power's given 
<br />To sway or to compel, 
<br />Among themselves apportion heaven 
<br />    And give her hell.

<br />Of fellow-men to happier prospects born, 
<br />Doomed Art and Nature's various stores to see 
<br />Flow in full cups of joy, -- and not for thee;

<br />Who dragg'st the load of faint and feeble years, 
<br />Whose bread is anguish, and whose water tears;

<br />Bend thy meek neck beneath the foot of Power; 
<br />But when thou feel'st the great deliverer nigh, 
<br />And thy freed spirit mounting seeks the sky, 
<br />Let no vain fears thy parting hour molest, 
<br />No whispered terrors shake thy quiet breast: 
<br />Think not their threats can work thy future woe. 
<br />Nor deem the Lord above like lords below; 
<br />Safe in the bosom of that love repose 
<br />By whom the sun gives light, the ocean flows; 
<br />Prepare to meet a Father undismayed, 
<br />Nor fear the God whom priests and kings have made.

<br />They are provident instead, 
<br />Content in the tight hot cell of their hearts 
<br />To eat dusty bread. 
<br /><br />They do not see cattle cropping red winter grass, 
<br />They do not hear 
<br />Snow water going down under culverts 
<br />Shallow and clear. 
<br /><br />They wait, when they should turn to journeys, 
<br />They stiffen, when they should bend. 
<br />They use against themselves that benevolence 
<br />To which no man is friend. 
<br /><br />They cannot think of so many crops to a field 
<br />Or of clean wood cleft by an axe. 
<br />Their love is an eager meaninglessness 
<br />Too tense, or too lax. 
<br /><br />They hear in every whisper that speaks to them 
<br />A shout and a cry. 
<br />As like as not, when they take life over their door-sills 
<br />They should let it go by.

<br />Facing a sheer sky. 
<br />Everything moved, -- a bell hung ready to strike, 
<br />Sun and reflection wheeled by. 
<br /><br />When the bare eyes were before me 
<br />And the hissing hair, 
<br />Held up at a window, seen through a door. 
<br />The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead 
<br />Formed in the air. 
<br /><br />This is a dead scene forever now. 
<br />Nothing will ever stir. 
<br />The end will never brighten it more than this, 
<br />Nor the rain blur. 
<br /><br />The water will always fall, and will not fall, 
<br />And the tipped bell make no sound. 
<br />The grass will always be growing for hay 
<br />Deep on the ground. 
<br /><br />And I shall stand here like a shadow 
<br />Under the great balanced day, 
<br />My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind, 
<br />And does not drift away.

<br />Till its pride is over-plain; 
<br />Love, when, so, you're loved again. 
<br />What's the best thing in the world? 
<br />--Something out of it, I think.

<br />On visions our childhood is fed; 
<br />And the heart of a child is unhaunted, it seems, 
<br />By ghosts of dreams that are dead. 
<br /><br />From childhood to youth's but a span, 
<br />And the years of our life are soon sped; 
<br />But the youth is no longer a youth, but a man, 
<br />When the first of his dreams is dead. 
<br /><br />'Tis a cup of wormwood and gall, 
<br />When the doom of a great man is said; 
<br />And the best of a man is under a pall 
<br />When the best of his dreams is dead. 
<br /><br />He may live on by compact and plan 
<br />When the fine bloom of living is shed, 
<br />But God pity the little that's left of a man 
<br />When most of his dreams are dead. 
<br /><br />Let him show a brave face if he can; 
<br />Let him woo fame and fortune instead; 
<br />Yet there's not much to do, but to bury a man 
<br />When the last of his dreams is dead.

<br />   Love me if I die! 
<br />What to me is life or death, 
<br />   So that thou be nigh? 
<br /><br />Once I loved thee rich, 
<br />   Now I love thee poor; 
<br />Ah! what is there I could not 
<br />   For thy sake endure? 
<br /><br />Kiss me for my love! 
<br />   Pay me for my pain! 
<br />Come! and murmur in my ear 
<br />   How thou lov'st again!
