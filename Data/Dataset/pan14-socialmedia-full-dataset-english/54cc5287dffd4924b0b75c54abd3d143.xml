But nobody, other than ourselves, knows which of these numbers belong to our closest family or friends.  If we were to be involved in an accident or were taken ill, the people attending on us would have our mobile phone but wouldn't know who to call. Yes, there are hundreds of numbers stored ; but which one is the contact person in case of an emergency? Hence this &quot;ICE&quot; (In Case of Emergency) Campaign.  The concept of &quot;ICE&quot; is catching on quickly. It is a method of contact during emergency situations. As cell phones are carried by the majority of the population, all you need to do is store the number of a contact person or persons who should be contacted during emergency under the name &quot;ICE&quot; ( In Case Of Emergency). 
<br />  The idea was thought up by a paramedic who found that when he went to the scenes of accidents, there were always mobile phones with patients, but they didn't know which number to call. He therefore thought that it would be a good idea if there was a nationally recognized name for this purpose. In an emergency situation, Emergency Service personnel and hospital Staff would be able to quickly contact the right person by simply dialing the number you have stored as &quot;ICE.&quot;  For more than one contact name, simply enter ICE 1, ICE 2 and ICE 3 etc. A great idea that will make a difference! Let's spread the concept of ICE by storing an ICE number in our mobile phones today!!! !  Please forward this. It won't take too many &quot;forwards&quot; before everybody will know about this. It really could save your life, or put a loved one's mind at rest .  ICE will speak for you when you are not able to do </strong>[/b]</span>

<br />Science has with GOD, The ALMIGHTY.
<br />He asks one of his New Christian Students to stand and . . .
<br /><br />Professor : You are a Christian, aren't you, son ?
<br />Student : Yes, sir.
<br />Professor : So you Believe in GOD ?
<br />Student : Absolutely, sir.
<br />Professor : Is GOD Good ?
<br />Student : Sure.
<br />Professor : Is GOD ALL - POWERFUL ?
<br />Student : Yes.
<br /><br />Professor : My Brother died of Cancer even though he prayed to GOD to Heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But GOD didn't.
<br />How is this GOD Good then ? Hmm ?
<br /><br />( Student is silent )
<br /><br />Professor : You can't answer, can you? Let's start again, young fella. Is GOD Good ?
<br />Student : Yes.
<br />Professor : Is Satan good ?
<br />Student : No..
<br />Professor : Where does Satan come from ?
<br />Student : From . . . GOD . . .
<br />Professor : That's right. Tell me son, is there evil in this World ?
<br />Student : Yes.
<br />Professor : Evil is everywhere, isn't it? And GOD did make Everything. Correct ?
<br />Student : Yes.
<br />Professor : So who created evil ?
<br /><br />( Student does not answer )
<br /><br />Professor : Is there Sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the World, don't they?
<br />Student : Yes, sir.
<br />Professor : So, who Created them ?
<br /><br />( Student has no answer )
<br /><br />Professor : Science says you have 5 Senses you use to Identify and Observe the World around you.
<br />Tell me, son . . . Have you ever Seen GOD ?
<br />Student : No, sir.
<br />Professor : Tell us if you have ever Heard your GOD ?
<br />Student : No , sir.
<br />Professor : Have you ever Felt your GOD, Tasted your GOD, Smelled your GOD? Have you ever had any Sensory Perception of GOD for that matter?
<br />Student : No, sir. I'm afraid I haven't.
<br />Professor : Yet you still Believe in HIM ?
<br />Student : Yes.
<br />Professor : According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?
<br />Student : Nothing. I only have my Faith.
<br />Professor : Yes. Faith. And that is the Problem Science has.
<br />Student : Professor, is there such a thing as Heat ?
<br />Professor : Yes.
<br />Student : And is there such a thing as Cold ?
<br />Professor : Yes.
<br />Student : No sir. There isn't.
<br /><br />( The Lecture Theatre becomes very quiet with this turn of events )
<br /><br />Student : Sir, you can have Lots of Heat, even More Heat, Superheat, Mega Heat, White Heat, a Little Heat or No Heat. But we don't have anything called Cold..
<br />We can hit 458 Degrees below Zero which is No Heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as Cold. Cold is only a Word we use to describe the Absence of Heat. We cannot Measure Cold. Heat is Energy. Cold is Not the Opposite of Heat, sir, just the Absence of it.
<br /><br />( There is Pin - Drop Silence in the Lecture Theatre )
<br /><br />Student : What about Darkness, Professor ? Is there such a thing as Darkness ?
<br />Professor : Yes. What is Night if there isn't Darkness ?
<br />Student : You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is the Absence of Something. You can have Low Light, Normal Light , Bright Light, Flashing Light . . .
<br />But if you have No Light Constantly, you have Nothing and it's called Darkness, isn't it? In reality, Darkness isn't.
<br />If it is, were you would be able to make Darkness Darker, wouldn't you?
<br /><br />Professor : So what is the point you are making, Young Man?
<br />Student : Sir, my point is your Philosophical Premise is Flawed.
<br />Professor : Flawed ? Can you explain how ?
<br />Student : Sir, you are working on the Premise of Duality.
<br />You argue there is Life and then there is Death, a Good GOD and a Bad GOD. You are viewing the Concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure.
<br />Sir, Science can't even explain a Thought. It uses Electricity and Magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view Death as the Opposite of Life is to be ignorant of the fact that
<br />Death cannot exist as a Substantive Thing.
<br />Death is Not the Opposite of Life : just the Absence of it. Now tell me, Professor, do you Teach your Students that they Evolved from a Monkey?
<br />Professor : If you are referring to the Natural Evolutionary Process, yes, of course, I do.
<br />Student : Have you ever observed Evolution with your own eyes, sir ?
<br /><br />( The Professor shakes his head with a Smile, beginning to realize where the Argument is going )
<br /><br />Student : Since no one has ever observed the Process of Evolution at work and cannot even prove that this Process is an On - Going Endeavor, are you not Teaching your Opinion, sir? Are you not a Scientist but a Preacher?
<br /><br />( The Class is in Uproar )
<br /><br />Student : Is there anyone in the Class who has ever Seen the Professor's Brain ?
<br /><br />( The Class breaks out into Laughter )
<br /><br />Student : Is there anyone here who has ever Heard the Professor's Brain, Felt it, Touched or Smelled it ? . . .
<br />No one appears to have done so. So, according to the Established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable
<br />Protocol, Science says that you have No Brain, sir.
<br />With all due respect, sir, how do we then Trust your Lectures, sir ?
<br /><br />( The Room is Silent. The Professor stares at the Student, his face unfathomable)
<br /><br />Professor : I guess you'll have to take them on Faith, son.
<br />Student : That is it sir . . . the Link between Man &amp; GOD is FAITH. That is all that Keeps Things Moving &amp; Alive.
<br /><br />NB:
<br />I believe you have enjoyed the Conversation . . . and if so . . .
<br />you'll probably want your Friends / Colleagues to enjoy the same . . .
<br />won't
<br />you ? . . .</strong>

Water-soluble vitamins are carried throughout the body in the bloodstream. They are, for the most part, not stored in the body. The body uses what it needs and the rest is passed in the urine. 
<br /><br />Vitamin C is essential for the manufacturing of collagen, that are necessary for tissue repair. It is needed for metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine, folic acid, iron. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of the body. Vitamin C is essential for the healing of wounds, and for the repair and maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.
<br /><br />Functions and benefits of Vitamin C
<br /><br />Vitamin C has a number of important functions and benefits. For example it: 
<br /><br />· It help improve male fertility 
<br /><br />· Reduce toxic effect of alcohol and drugs 
<br /><br />·  Reduce symptoms of arthritis, skin ulcers, allergic reactions 
<br /><br />· It also helps produce anti-stress hormones 
<br /><br />· Help in production of red blood cells 
<br /><br /><strong>Recommended Dosage for Vitamin C</strong>
<br /><br />· For adults, the usual dose of Vitamin C is 60 mg. 
<br /><br />· For Pregnant women, the usual dose is 70 mg. 
<br /><br />What food source is the nutrient found in?
<br />The best sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits such as:
<br /><br />Oranges 
<br />Orange juice 
<br />Grapefruit 
<br />And tangerines 
<br />Melons 
<br />Kiwi 
<br />Strawberries
<br />Vegetables such as:
<br /><br />Broccoli 
<br />Sweet green and red peppers 
<br />Potatoes (with skin) 
<br />Tomatoes 
<br />Brussels sprouts 
<br />Cabbage and many dark green leafy vegetables are all good sources of vitamin C. Vitamin C can be easily lost in foods when they are cooked or handled improperly.
<br /><br />Fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are the best choices for getting vitamin C. Canned vegetables lose vitamin C during processing. If the canning water is thrown out, even more is lost. Freezing has little effect on Vitamin C. Cooking vegetables too long at high heats, for example boiling, can destroy vitamin C.
<br /><br />Most of the vitamin C is left in the cooking water, which is usually thrown away. Cutting and slicing fruits and vegetables leaves a greater surface exposed to air and light, which will also destroy vitamin C. Raw fruits and vegetables should be eaten shortly after they were cut. They should be cooked only for a short time in a small amount of water or by steaming. Aging and leaving fruits and vegetables at room temperature too long can also destroy vitamin C.
<br /><br />How does the nutrient affect the body?
<br />Vitamin C is important to many body functions. It helps the body:
<br /><br />Build and maintain collagen, which are fibers that make up the tissue between tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage. 
<br />Maintain healthy bones, teeth, gums, red blood cells, and blood vessels. 
<br />Heal wounds, bruises, and fractures. 
<br />Absorb iron from plant food sources. 
<br />Protect from infection by keeping the immune system healthy. 
<br />Reduce some of the risk of certain chronic diseases by acting as an antioxidant.
<br />Antioxidants help the body fight the effects of free radicals, which can damage the body.
<br /><br />Deficiency Symptoms of Vitamin C 
<br /><br />· Beneath the skin
<br /><br />· Swollen or painful joints
<br /><br />· Nosebleeds
<br /><br />· Splitting hair
<br /><br />· Gingivitis (inflammation of the gums)
<br /><br />· Bleeding gums
<br /><br />· Depression
<br /><br />· Easy bruising
<br /><br />· Impaired wound healing
<br /><br />· Tiredness
<br /><br />Information
<br />Vitamin C has a long history. It was used as a cure for scurvy. Scurvy is a disease that causes open sores in the mouth, loosening of teeth, and soft gums. In the 1700s, it was discovered that sailors who often consumed lime juice did not get scurvy. Sailors who did not consume lime juice had a 50 percent chance of dying from scurvy. It was not until 200 years later that vitamin C was found to prevent the disease. 
<br /><br />Severe deficiency, going for a very long time without vitamin C, can lead to scurvy. 
<br /><br />Severe deficiency and scurvy are rare in the United States . Poor vitamin C intake is more common. Alcohol intake, stress, smoking, poor intake of fruits and vegetables, and chronic illness can contribute to vitamin C deficiency. Signs of deficiency include: 
<br /><br />Inflamed gums. 
<br />Slow wound healing. 
<br />Stomach disorders. 
<br />Reduced resistance to colds and infections. 
<br />Skin problems.
<br />Large doses of vitamin C can cause stomach upset, diarrhea, or kidney stones. The upper levels for vitamin C is 2,000 milligrams (mg) per day for adults. People should not routinely go above the set upper levels for vitamins and minerals. An upper level is not the recommended amount to take. It is the maximum amount of a vitamin or mineral that is likely to cause no health risks. Some scientists think not enough is known about mega dosing, or taking extremely high doses of vitamins, to claim that it has health benefits. There is debate if mega doses of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, can help decrease the risk for chronic diseases. Much of the current information is conflicting, therefore, more research is needed. 
<br /><br />The recommended dietary allowances, or RDAs, for vitamin C were recently increased. Levels were increased to provide maximum health benefits. Levels were raised from 60 mg daily to 75 mg per day for women and 90 mg per day for men. Smokers are advised to take an extra 35 mg daily. This is because smoking depletes the body of some vitamin C. Pregnant and nursing women need slightly more, too. Many people do not get enough vitamin C. Thirty-nine percent of men and 43 percent of women fall short of the recommended amount. 
<br /><br />Because vitamin C cannot be stored in the body; it is important to eat foods high in vitamin C. Eating a well-balanced diet, including at least five servings of fruit and vegetables every day, should provide all the body needs.

<br />Pay attention to what you read. After you have finished reading it, you will know the reason it was sent to you. Here goes:
<br /><br />People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person. When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on.
<br /><br />Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real. But only for a season.!
<br /><br />LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.
<br /><br />Thank you for being a part of my life, whether you were a reason, a season or a lifetime.

<br /><br />·        To light a candle, is better than damning the darkness
<br /><br />·        The most beautiful word is the truth.
<br /><br />·        Respect is the key for communication.
<br /><br />·         A bell’s not a bell till you ring it, a song’s not a song till you sing it. Love in your heart wasn’t put there to stay, a love’s not a love till you give it away!
<br /><br />·        God enters by a private door into every individual.
<br /><br />·        Worry is an abuse of God’s gift of imagination.
<br /><br />·        If you want happiness… For an hour, take a nap… For a day, go fishing…. For a month, get married…. For a year, inherit a fortune…. For a life time, help someone else
<br /><br />·        If you have one true friend, you have more than your share.
<br /><br />·        Four things to learn in life
<br /><br />1.     To think clearly without burry or confusion.
<br /><br />2.     To love everybody sincerely when you talk about love.
<br /><br />3.     To act in everything with the biggest motives.
<br /><br />4.     To trust God unbesitatingly.
<br /><br />·        The greatest weakness of most humans is their besitancy to tell others how much they love hem while they’re still alive.
<br /><br />·        Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss  is what dies inside us while we live.
<br /><br />·        When faced with a decision, decide. When faced with a choice, choose. Sitting on the fence will leave you too tense because you neither win nor lose!
<br /><br />*** *** *** *** ***
<br /><br />·       Once upon a time, a man living in village won horse. The people of the village said: &quot;how lucky is this man?!!!!&quot;. On the second week, the man fell down from the back of his horse a he broke his leg. The people of the village said: &quot; how unlucky he is!!!&quot; On the third week, the war has stared and all the men of village had to join the army except him because he got a broken leg. The people of the village said again: &quot;He is a very lucky man&quot;....and so on .... 
<br /><br />*** *** *** *** ***
<br /><br />·        Once upon a time, a bird was migrating for the winter. She flew for a long time and it got very cold. It got too cold that it fell. She was on the floor freezing and all of a sudden a cow comes and takes a crap on her. She gets warm from the crap and she can move a little now. Then a cat came and cleaned up the bird. After she was all cleaned up the cat ate the bird. The morale of the story is just because something looks nice isn’t always a good thing, it could be a bad one. And bad things can help you sometimes. God says here: “ don’t wish something too badly, it could be a bad one and also don’t hate something too much, it could be useful for you. Just trust in me and I will always take care of you”. 
<br /><br />*** *** *** *** ***
<br /><br />·        ………… 
<br /><br />*N.B. Please take note that the above wisdoms are taken from different resources like “The Chicken soup series”, the Holly BOOK (Qura’an)……etc. Some are from personal experience in life. Some are fairy tales.

<br /><br />1. Those who kiss their partner goodbye each morning live five years longer than those who don't.
<br /><br />2. Kissing is great for self-esteem. It makes you feel appreciated and helps your state of mind.
<br /><br />3. Kissing burns calories, 2-3 calories a minute and can double your metabolic rate. Research claims that three passionate kisses a day (at least lasting 20 seconds each) will cause you to loose an entire extra pound! It's time to start that kissing diet!
<br /><br />4. Kissing is a known stress-reliever. Passionate kissing relieves tension, reduces negative energy and produces a sense of well being, lowering your cortisol 'stress' hormone.
<br /><br />5. Kissing uses 30 facial muscles and it helps keep the facial muscles tight, preventing baggy cheeks! The tension in the muscles caused by a passionate kiss helps smooth the skin and increases the circulation.
<br /><br />6. Kissing is good for the heart, as it creates an adrenaline which causes your heart to pump more blood around your body. Frequent kissing has scientifically been proven to stabilize cardiovascular activity, decrease blood pressure and cholesterol.
<br /><br />7. Those who kiss quite frequently are less likely to suffer from stomach, bladder and blood infections.
<br /><br />8. During a kiss, natural antibiotics are secreted in the saliva. Also, the saliva contains a type of anesthetic that helps relieve pain.
<br /><br />9. Kissing reduces anxiety and stops the 'noise' in your mind. It increases the levels of oxytocin, an extremely calming hormone that produces a feeling of peace.
<br /><br />10. The endorphins produced by kissing are 200 times more powerful than morphine.

<br /><br />The top prize for The World Most Venomous Animal,would go to the Box Jellyfish. It has caused at least 5,567 recorded deaths since 1954. Their venom is among the most deadly in the world. Its toxins attack the heart, nervous system, and skin cells. And the worst part of it is that jelly box venom is so overpoweringly painful, that human victims go in shock, drown or die of heart failure before even reaching shore. Survivors experience pain weeks after the contact with box jellies.
<br /><br />You have virtually no chance to survive the venomous sting, unless treated immediately. After a sting, vinegar should be applied for a minimum of 30 seconds. Vinegar has acetic acid, which disables the box jellys nematocysts that have not yet discharged into the bloodstream (though it will not alleviate the pain). Wearing panty hose while swimming is also a good prevention measure since it can prevent jellies from being able to harm your legs.
<br /><br />Jelly box can be found in the waters around Asia and Australia.
<br /><br />2. King Cobra
<br /><br />The King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) is the worlds longest venomous snake - growing up to 5.6 m (18.5 ft) in length. Ophiophagus, literally means snake-eater as it eats other snakes. One single bite of this deadly snake can easily kill a human. This snake is even capable of killing a full-grown Asian Elephant within 3 hours if the larger animal is bitten in a vulnerable area such as the trunk.
<br /><br />Its venom is not as toxic as other venomous snakes, but King Cobra is capable of injecting 5 times more venom than black mamba and can result in mortality up to 5 times faster than that of the black mamba. It is quite widespread, ranging across South and South-east Asia, living in dense highland forests.
<br /><br />3. Marbled Cone Snail
<br /><br />This little beautiful looking Marbled Cone snail can be as deadly as any other animal on this list. One drop of its venom is so powerful that it can kill more than 20 humans. If you ever happen to be in warm salt water environment (where these snails are often found) and see it, dont even think of picking it up. Of course, the true purpose of its venom is to catch its prey.
<br /><br />Symptoms of a cone snail sting can start immediately or can be delayed in onset for days. It results in intense pain, swelling, numbness and tingling. Severe cases involve muscle paralysis, vision changes and breathing failure. There is no antivenom. However, only about 30 human deaths have been recorded from cone snail envenomation.
<br /><br />4. Blue-Ringed Octopus
<br /><br />The Blue-Ringed Octopus is very small, only the size of a golf ball, but its venom is so powerful that can kill a human. Actually it carries enough poison to kill 26 adult humans within minutes, and there is no antidote. They are currently recognized as one of the worlds most venomous animals.
<br /><br />Its painless bite may seem harmless, but the deadly neurotoxins begin working immediately resulting in muscular weakness, numbness, followed by a cessation and breathing and ultimately death.
<br /><br />They can be found in tide pools in the Pacific Ocean, from Japan to Australia.
<br /><br />5. Death Stalker Scorpion
<br /><br />Contrarily to the popular belief most of the scorpions are relatively harmless to humans as stings produce only local effects (pain, numbness or swelling). However, the Death Starker Scorpion is highly dangerous species because its venom is a powerful cocktail of neurotoxins which causes an intense and unbearable pain, then fever, followed by coma, convulsions, paralysis and death. Fortunately, while a sting from this scorpion is extremely painful, it would be unlikely to kill a healthy, adult human. Young children, the old, or infirm (with a heart condition) are at the biggest risk.
<br />Death stalker scorpions are spread in North Africa and Middle East.
<br /><br />6. Stonefish
<br /><br />Maybe Stonefish would never win a beauty contest, but it would definitely win the top prize for being The World Most Venomous Fish. Its venom causes such a severe pain that the victims of its sting want the affected limb to be amputated. It is described as the worst pain known to man. It is accompanied with possible shock, paralysis, and tissue death. If not given medical attention within a couple of hours It can be fatal to humans.
<br /><br />Stonefish stores its toxins in gruesome-looking spines that are designed to hurt would-be predators.
<br /><br />Stonefish mostly live above the tropic of Capricorn, often found in the shallow tropical marine waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans, ranging from the Red Sea to the Queensland Great Barrier Reef.
<br /><br />7. The Brazilian wandering spider
<br /><br />The Brazilian Wandering Spider (Phoneutria) or banana spider appears in the Guinness Book of World Records 2007 for the most venomous spider and is the spider responsible for most human deaths.
<br /><br />This spider is believed to have the most potent neurotoxic venom of any living spider. Only 0.006mg (0.00000021oz) is sufficient to kill a mouse. They are also so dangerous because of their wandering nature. They often hide during daytime in highly populated areas inside houses, clothes, boots, and cars.
<br /><br />Its venomous bite causes not only intense pain, the venom of the spider can also cause priapism - uncomfortable erections lasting for many hours that lead to impotence.
<br /><br />8. Inland Taipan
<br /><br />The prize for The Worlds Most Venomous Snake goes to the Inland Taipan of Australia. Just a single bite from this snake contains enough venom to kill 100 human adults or an army of 250,000 mice. Its venom is at least 200 - 400 times more toxic than a common cobra. The Inland Taiwans extremely neurotoxic venom can kill an adult human in as little as 45 minutes. Fortunately this snake is very shy and there have been no documented human fatalities (all known bites were treated with antivenin).
<br /><br />9. Poison Dart Frog
<br /><br />If you ever happen to be running through the rain forests somewhere in Central or South America, do not ever pick up beautiful and colorful frogs - it can be the Poison Dart Frog. This frog is probably the most poisonous animal on earth.The 2 inch long (5cm) golden poison dart frog has enough venom to kill 10 adult humans or 20,000 mice. Only 2 micrograms of this lethal toxin (the amount that fits on the head of a pin) is capable of killing a human or other large mammal. They are called dart frogs because indigenous Amerindians use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of their blow-darts.. Poison dart frogs keep their poison in their skins and will sicken or kill anybody who touches or eats it.
<br /><br />10. Puffer Fish
<br /><br />Puffer Fish are the second most poisonous vertebrate on earth (the first one is golden dart Frog). The meat of some species is a delicacy in both Japan (as fugu) and Korea (as bok-uh) but the problem is that the skin and certain organs of many puffer fish are very poisonous to humans.
<br /><br />This puffy fish produce rapid and violent death..Puffers poisoning causes deadening of the tongue and lips, dizziness, vomiting, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and muscle paralysis. Victims die from suffocation as diaphragm muscles are paralyzed. Most of the victims die after four to 24 hours. There is no known antidote, Most deaths from fugu happen when untrained people catch and prepare the fish.
<br /><br />Statistics show that there were 20 to 44 incidents of fugu poisoning per year between 1996 and 2006 in all of Japan and up to six incidents per year led to death. Since Fugus poison can cause near instantaneous death, only licensed chefs are allowed to prepare it.

No matter what they look like or how much money they have, they can walk into a room and instantly be the center of attention. When they leave, people think highly of them and want to emulate them. Thats charisma, a sort of magnetism that inspires confidence and adoration.
<br /><br />Like beauty, luck, and social position, charisma can open many doors in life. Unlike these other qualities, anyone can become more charismatic.
<br /><br />1. Improve your posture. Good posture will give the impression of self confidence (even if you dont feel that way on the inside). While walking, maintain a relaxed yet definitive upright posture: spine long, shoulders back, head level with the ground. This may feel awkward or overpowering to you when you first practice it, but keep trying.
<br /><br />2. Relax the muscles in your face to the point where you have a natural, pleasant expression permanently engraved there. Face the world and show everyone youre not afraid.
<br /><br />3. Make a connection. When your eyes come in contact with another persons, nod and smile subtly with a subdued joy shining forth. Dont worry about the other persons reaction and dont overdo it.
<br /><br />4. Remember peoples names when you meet them for the first time. This takes an enormous amount of effort for most people. Repeat the persons name when stating your name to that person will help you to remember it better. For example: Hi Jack, Im Wendy. Follow through with small talk and repeat the persons name. Repeat it once more when you say goodbye. Its not just about helping you to remember that person. The more you say a persons name, the more that person will feel that you like them and the greater the chance theyll warm up to you.
<br /><br />5. Be interested in people. If you meet a new acquaintance, for example a coworker, a classmate, a friend of a friend, etc. find out about their immediate family and interests. Be sure to ask after the names of family members and remember them. Be careful in that subject though you dont want to be nosy. If you ask too much they will become uncomfortable. Also ask after their particular interests in life. These two topics will ensure much better small talk than just harping on about school or work. Most people dont like to think about those things at social occasions unless they have to. Even if it is about networking, you should understand fully the worth of taking a break from talking shop. It is important to refrain from talking up about yourself. Be purely interested and impressed by the person with whom you are speaking.
<br /><br />6. Orient topics toward the audience. This means taking into account topics that interest those around you, even if you are not so keen on them. If you are in a sporty crowd, talk about last nights game or the meteoric rise of a new team. If you are amongst a group of hobbyists, draw out their hobbies and make remarks related to fishing, knitting, mountain climbing, movies, etc. Nobody expects you to be an expert. It is your level of interest and willingness to engage in topics that makes you an interesting person to be around. Exercise an open mind. Let others do the explaining. If someone mistakenly thinks you know more about the topic, be genuine and simply say that your knowledge is limited but that you are hoping to learn more about it.
<br /><br />7. Praise others instead of gossiping. If you are talking with someone or you are talking in a group of people, and up pops the subject of another person in a positive or negative way, be the one to mention something you like about that person. Hearsay is the most powerful tool in gaining charm because it is always viewed as 100% sincere. It has the added benefit of creating trust in you. The idea will spread that you never have a bad word to say about anyone. Everyone will know that their reputation is safe with you.
<br /><br />8. Dont Lie. A lie is something you say for which there is some direct evidence somewhere out there that contradicts it. If you tell Mary that you like Jane and Billy that you dont like Jane, Mary and Billy will talk and your reputation will be ruined. No one will believe a word you say.
<br /><br />9. Issue compliments generously, especially to raise others self esteem. Try to pick out something that you appreciate in any situation and verbally express that appreciation. If you like something or someone, find a creative way to say it and say it immediately. If you wait too long, it may be viewed as insincere and badly timed, especially if others have beaten you to it. If you notice that someone is putting a lot of effort into something, compliment it, even if you feel that there is room for improvement. If you notice that someone has changed something about themselves haircut, manner of dress) notice it, and point out something you like about it. If you are asked directly, be charming and deflect the question with a very general compliment.
<br /><br />10. Be gracious in accepting compliments. Get out of the habit of assuming that the compliment is being given without genuine intent. Even when someone makes a compliment out of contempt, there is always a germ of jealous truth hiding in their own heart. Be effusive in accepting the compliment. Go beyond a mere thank you and enjoin this with Im glad you like it or It is so kind of you to have noticed. These are compliments in return. Avoid backhanding a compliment. There is nothing worse to a person complimenting than to receive the response Oh well I wish I was as ______ as you/that situation. That is tantamount to saying, No, I am not what you are saying I am, and your judgment is wrong.
<br /><br />11. Control your tone of voice. The tone of your voice is crucial. Most people feel insecure somewhere inside and have an inability to accept praise. For this very reason, when you praise, do it subtly and glibly. When you say, you look nice today it should be in the exact same tone that you would use to say its a nice day. Any variation from your normal tone will arouse suspicion about your sincerity. Practice giving compliments into a recorder and play it back. Does it sound sincere? Practice until you get it right.. It might not sound right to you, in that case, ask someone for judgement.
<br /><br />Tips
<br /><br />* Developing charisma is an art. The general guidelines above can help you be more charismatic, but your charisma must come from within you and must reflect you as an individual or it will appear fake. Fortunately, everyone has the ability to be charismatic, and it simply needs to be coaxed out. Practice and take note of what works and what needs improvement.
<br /><br />* Dont mimic others. People with well developed charisma have a remarkable ability not only to sway peoples opinions but also to cause others to emulate their personalities and even gestures. At the same time, however, research has shown that charismatic people do not emulate other charismatic people. Their individuality sets them apart.
<br /><br />* Have a message. Dont be afraid to be controversial, to push the envelope. If you believe in something or feel strongly about it, communicate that in a respectful way. Your charisma will help people be accepting of your ideas.</div>

<br />Have a look at the wrapper on a Coca-Cola 1.5 liter bottle and in the 
<br />ingredients label you will find phosphoric acid in it. Minute 
<br />quantities of ethylene glycol are also used (which is acknowledged 
<br />in the soft drink world for making it really chill). 
<br />This is popularly known as anti-freeze which prevents water from 
<br />freezing at 0 deg C and instead drops it 4-5 degrees with minute 
<br />quantities. This chemical is a known slow poison in the caliber of arsenic. 
<br /><br />So, if you manage to drink about 4 liters of Coke within an hour or 
<br />so, you can die. 
<br /><br />Read along and give up these dangerous things. 
<br />Be natural; have flavored milks, tender coconuts, buttermilk, lassi and plain water instead of these &quot;soft&quot; drinks. 
<br /><br />Guess what's the pH for soft drinks, e.g. Coke? PH 3.4! 
<br /><br />This acidity is strong enough to dissolve teeth and bones! 
<br /><br />Our human body stops building bones at the age of about 30. Softdrinks do not have any nutrition value (in terms of vitamins &amp; minerals). It is high in sugar content, carbonic acid, chemicals i.e. colorings etc. 
<br /><br />Some like to take cold soft drinks after each meal. Guess what's the 
<br />impact? Our body needs an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius 
<br />for digestive enzyme functioning. The temperature of cold soft drinks is very much below 37 degrees or even close to 0 degrees Celsius. This will dilute the enzymes &amp; stress the digestive system. The food taken will not be digested. In fact it will be fermented! The fermented food produces gases, decays and becomes toxin, gets absorbed by the intestine, circulates in the blood stream and is carried to the whole body. Hence toxin is cumulated in other parts of the body, developing into various diseases. 
<br /><br />Think before you drink Coke/Pepsi (or any soft drink) again. 
<br /><br />Have you ever thought what you drink when you drink an aerated drink? 
<br />You gulp down carbon dioxide, when nobody in the world would advise you to drink CO2. Two months back, there was a competition at Delhi 
<br />University &quot;Who could drink the most Coke?&quot; The winner drank 8 bottles and fainted on the spot-too much CO2 in the blood. Thereafter, the principal banned all soft drinks from the college canteen! 
<br /><br />While this might have been an extreme measure, their results do 
<br />provide some food for thought. Did you know that soft drinks use chemicals in them that cause immense harm to you. Someone put a broken tooth in a 
<br />bottle of Pepsi and in 10 days it DISSOLVED! Can you believe it? Teeth and bones are the only human parts that stay intact for years after death. Imagine what the drink must be doing to your soft intestines and stomach lining!
