<br />1. A nursery school pupil told his teacher he'd found a cat, but it was dead. 
<br />&quot;How do you know that the cat was dead?&quot; she asked her pupil. 
<br />&quot;Because I pissed in its ear and it didn't move,&quot; answered the child innocently. 
<br />&quot;You did WHAT?&quot; the teacher exclaimed in surprise. 
<br />&quot;You know,&quot; explained the boy, &quot;I leaned over and went 'Pssst' and it didn't move&quot; 
<br /><br />2. A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later.....&quot;Da-ad....&quot; 
<br />&quot;What?&quot; 
<br />&quot;I'm thirsty. Can you bring a drink of water?&quot; 
<br />&quot;No, You had your chance. Lights out.&quot; 
<br />Five minutes later: &quot;Da-aaaad.....&quot; 
<br />&quot;WHAT?&quot; 
<br />&quot;I'm THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??&quot; 
<br />I told you NO! If you ask again, I'll have to smack you!!&quot; 
<br />Five minutes later......&quot;Daaaa-aaaad.....&quot; 
<br />&quot;WHAT!&quot; 
<br />&quot;When you come in to smack me, can you bring a drink of water?&quot; 
<br /><br />3. An exasperated mother, whose son was always getting into mischief, finally asked him &quot;How do you expect to get into Heaven?&quot; 
<br />The boy thought it over and said, &quot;Well, I'll run in and out and in and out and keep slamming the door until St. Peter says, 'For Heaven's sake, Dylan, come in or stay out!'&quot; 
<br /><br />4. One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking her son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with a tremor in his voice, &quot;Mummy,will you sleep with me tonight?&quot; 
<br />The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. &quot;I can't dear,&quot; she said. &quot;I have to sleep in Daddy's room.&quot; 
<br />A long silence was broken at last by his shaky little voice: &quot;The big sissy.&quot; 
<br /><br />5. It was that time, during the Sunday morning service, for the children's sermon. All the children were invited to come forward. One little girl was wearing a particularly pretty dress and,as she sat down, the minister leaned over and said, &quot;That is a very pretty dress. Is it your Easter Dress?&quot; 
<br />The little girl replied, directly into the minister's clip-on microphone, &quot;Yes, and my Mum says it's a bitch to iron.&quot; 
<br /><br />6. When I was six months pregnant with my third child, my three year old came into the room when I was just getting ready to get into the shower. 
<br />She said, &quot;Mummy, you are getting fat!&quot; 
<br />I replied, &quot;Yes, honey, remember Mummy has a baby growing in her tummy.&quot; 
<br />&quot;I know,&quot; she replied, but what's growing in your bum?&quot; 
<br /><br />7. A little boy was doing his math homework. He said to himself, 
<br />&quot;Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven. 
<br />Three plus six, that son of a bitch is nine....&quot; 
<br />His mother heard what he was saying and gasped, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 
<br />The little boy answered, &quot;I'm doing my math homework, Mum.&quot; 
<br />&quot;And this is how your teacher taught you to do it?&quot; the mother asked 
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered. 
<br />Infuriated, the mother asked the teacher the next day, &quot;What are you teaching my son in math?&quot; 
<br />The teacher replied, &quot;Right now, we are learning addition.&quot; 
<br />The mother asked, &quot;And are you teachingthem to say two plus two, that son of a bitch is four?&quot; 
<br />After the teacher stopped laughing, she answered, 
<br />&quot;What I taught them was, two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH, is four.&quot; 
<br /><br />8. One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of Chicken Little to her class. She came to the part of the story where Chicken Little tried to warn the farmer. She read, &quot;.... and so Chicken 
<br />Little went up to the farmer and said, &quot;The sky is falling, the sky is falling!&quot; 
<br />The teacher paused then asked the class, &quot;And what do you think that farmer said?&quot; 
<br />One little girl raised her hand and said, &quot;I think he said: 'Holy Shit! A talking chicken!'&quot; 
<br />The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes. 
<br /><br />9. A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, 
<br />&quot;I'm Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter.&quot; 
<br />Her mother told her this was wrong, she must say, &quot;I'm Jane Sugarbrown.&quot; 
<br />The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday School, and said, &quot;Aren't you Mr. 
<br />Sugarbrown's daughter?&quot; 
<br />She replied, &quot;I thought I was, butmother says I'm not.&quot; 
<br /><br />10. A little girl asked her mother, &quot;Can I go outside and play with the boys?&quot; 
<br />Her mother replied, &quot;No, you can't play with the boys, they're too rough.&quot; 
<br />The little girl thought about it for a few moments and asked, If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?&quot; 
<br /><br />11. A little girl goes to the barber shop with her father. 
<br />She stands next to the barber chair, while her dad gets his hair cut, eating a snack cake The barber says to her, &quot;Sweetheart, you're gonna get hair on your muffin.&quot; 
<br />She says, &quot;Yes, I know, and I'm gonna get boobs too.&quot;

<br />&gt;  HE LIVED ALL ALONE
<br />&gt;  IN A ONE BEDROOM HOUSE MADE OF PLASTER AND STONE
<br />&gt;  I HAD COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY WITH PRESENTS TO GIVE
<br />&gt;  AND TO SEE JUST WHO IN THIS HOME DID LIVE
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  I LOOKED ALL ABOUT A STRANGE SIGHT I DID SEE
<br />&gt;  NO TINSEL NO PRESENTS NOT EVEN A TREE
<br />&gt;  NO STOCKING BY THE MANTLE JUST BOOTS FILLED WITH SAND
<br />&gt;  ON THE WALL HUNG PICTURES OF FAR DISTANT LANDS
<br />&gt;  WITH MEDALS AND BADGES AWARDS OF ALL KINDS
<br />&gt;  A SOBER THOUGHT CAME THROUGH MY MIND
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  FOR THIS HOUSE WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS DARK AND DREARY
<br />&gt;  I FOUND THE HOME OF A SOLDIER ONCE I COULD SEE CLEARLY
<br />&gt;  THE SOLDIER LAY SLEEPING SILENT ALONE
<br />&gt;  CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR IN THIS ONE BEDROOM HOME
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THE FACE WAS SO GENTLE THE ROOM IN SUCH DISORDER
<br />&gt;  NOT HOW I PICTURED A LONE BRITISH SOLDIER
<br />&gt;  WAS THIS THE HERO OF WHOM I'D JUST READ
<br />&gt;  CURLED UP ON A PONCHO THE FLOOR FOR A BED
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  I REALISED THE FAMILIES THAT I SAW THIS NIGHT
<br />&gt;  OWED THEIR LIVES TO THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE WILLING TO FIGHT
<br />&gt;  SOON ROUND THE WORLD THE CHILDREN WOULD PLAY
<br />&gt;  AND GROWNUPS WOULD CELEBRATE A BRIGHT CHRISTMAS DAY
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THEY ALL ENJOY FREEDOM EACH MONTH OF THE YEAR
<br />&gt;  BECAUSE OF THE SOLDIERS LIKE THE ONE LYING HERE
<br />&gt;  I COULDN'T HELP WONDER HOW MANY ALONE
<br />&gt;  ON A COLD CHRISTMAS EVE IN A LAND FAR FROM HOME
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THE VERY THOUGH BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE
<br />&gt;  I DROPPED TO MY KNEES AND STARTED TO CRY
<br />&gt;  THE SOLDIER AWAKENED AND I HEARD A ROUGH VOICE
<br />&gt;  'SANTA DON'T CRY THIS LIFE IS MY CHOICE
<br />&gt;  I FIGHT FOR FREEDOM I DON'T ASK FOR MORE
<br />&gt;  MY LIFE IS MY GOD, MY COUNTRY. MY CORPS'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER AND DRIFTED TO SLEEP
<br />&gt;  I COULDN'T CONTROL IT I CONTINUED TO WEEP
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  I KEPT WATCH FOR HOURS SO SILENT AND STILL
<br />&gt;  AND WE BOTH SAT AND SHIVERED FROM THE COLD NIGHTS CHILL
<br />&gt;  I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE ON THAT COLD DARK NIGHT
<br />&gt;  THIS GUARDIAN OF HONOUR SO WILLING TO FIGHT
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THEN THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER WITH A VOICE SOFT AND PURE
<br />&gt;  WHISPERED 'CARRY ON SANTA ITS CHRISTMAS DAY ALL IS SECURE'
<br />&gt;  ONE LOOK AT MY WATCH AND I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT
<br />&gt;  'MERRY CHRISTMAS MY FRIEND AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT'
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;                                                 * * *
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  THIS POEM WAS WRITTEN BY A PEACE KEEPING SOLDIER STATIONED OVERSEAS
<br />&gt;  THE FOLLOWING IS HIS REQUEST I THINK IT IS REASONABLE.
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  PLEASE WOULD YOU DO ME THE KIND FAVOUR OF SENDING THIS TO AS MANY PEOPLE
<br />&gt; AS YOU CAN
<br />&gt;
<br />&gt;  CHRISTMAS WILL BE COMING SOON AND SOME CREDIT IS DUE TO OUR BRITISH
<br />&gt; SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN FOR OUR BEING ABLE TO CELEBRATE THESE FESTIVITIES.
<br />&gt;  LETS TRY IN THIS SMALL WAY TO PAY A TINY BIT BACK OF WHAT WE OWE!

<br /><br />The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. 
<br /><br />I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. 
<br /><br />And then you die. What's that? A bonus? 
<br /><br />I think the life-cycle is all backwards. 
<br /><br />You should die first and get it all over with. 
<br /><br />Then you live in an old age home. 
<br /><br />You get kicked out when you're too young. 
<br /><br />You get a gold watch. 
<br /><br />You go to work. 
<br /><br />You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. 
<br /><br />You do drugs, alcohol and party. 
<br /><br />You get ready for high school. 
<br /><br />You go to grade school and become a kid. 
<br /><br />You play. You have no responsibilities. 
<br /><br />You become a little baby &amp; go back into the womb. 
<br /><br />You spend your last nine months floating... 
<br /><br />Then, you finish off as an orgasm. I like it.

<br /><br />Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be out of work and their dreams would be shattered. Then say to myself, &quot;It  is better that I drink this beer and let their dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver.&quot;-by Jack Handy
<br /><br />I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.  -by Frank Sinatra
<br /><br />An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with his fools.-Ernest Hemingway
<br /><br />When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.-Henny Youngman
<br /><br />24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence?-Stephen Wright
<br /><br />When we drink, we get drunk. When we get drunk, we fall asleep. When we fall asleep, we commit no sin. When we commit no sin, we go to heaven.  Sooooo, let's all get drunk and go to heaven!  - Brian  O'Rourke
<br /><br />Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.-Benjamin  Franklin
<br /><br />Without question, the greatest invention in the history of mankind is beer. Oh, I grant you that the wheel was also a fine invention, but the wheel does not go nearly as well with pizza.-Dave Barry

Early variations of the song were sung prior to 1700 and inspired Burns to produce the modern rendition. An old Scotch tune, 'Auld Lang Syne' literally means 'old long ago,' or simply, 'the good old days.'
<br /><br />Here are the lyrics: so many people seem to remember only the first verse. 
<br /><br />Auld Lang Syne

<br />Finally fed up, God said, &quot;THAT'S IT! I have had enough. I am going to set up a test that will run for two hours, and from those results, I will judge who does the better job.&quot; 
<br />So Satan and Jesus sat down at the keyboards and typed away. 
<br />They moused. 
<br />They faxed. 
<br />They e-mailed. 
<br />They e-mailed with attachments. 
<br />They downloaded. 
<br />They did spreadsheets! 
<br />They wrote reports. 
<br />They created labels and cards. 
<br />They created charts and graphs. 
<br />They did some genealogy reports 
<br />They did every job known to man. 
<br />Jesus worked with heavenly efficiency and Satan was faster than ever. 
<br />Then, ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, rain poured, and, of course, the power went off.. 
<br />Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld. 
<br />Jesus just sighed. 
<br />Finally the electricity came back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming: &quot;It's gone! It's all GONE! &quot;I lost everything when the power went out!&quot; 
<br />Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours of work. 
<br />Satan observed this and became irate. 
<br />&quot;Wait!&quot; he screamed. &quot;That's not fair! He cheated! How come he has all his work and I don't have any?&quot; 
<br />God just shrugged and said, 
<br /><br />JESUS SAVES

<br /><br />Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a  Belgian beer, then travelling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV.
<br /><br />And the most British thing of all? - Suspicion of anything foreign.
<br /><br />Oh and...
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... can a pizza get to your house faster than an ambulance.
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... do supermarkets make sick people walk all the way to the back of the shop to get their prescriptions while healthy people can buy cigarettes at the front.
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... do people order double cheeseburgers, large fries and a DIET coke.
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... do banks leave both doors open and chain the pens to the counters.
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... do we leave cars worth thousands of pounds on the drive and lock our junk and cheap lawn mower in the garage.
<br /><br />Only in Britain .. do we use answering machines to screen calls and then have call waiting so we won't miss a call from someone we didn't want to talk to in the first place.
<br /><br />Only in Britain ... are there disabled parking places in front of a skating rink.
<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION...
<br /><br />3 Brits die each year testing if a 9v battery works on their tongue.
<br /><br />142 Brits were injured in 1999 by not removing all pins from new shirts.
<br /><br />58 Brits are injured each year by using sharp knives instead of screwdrivers.
<br /><br />31 Brits have died since 1996 by watering their Christmas tree while the fairy lights were plugged in.
<br /><br />19 Brits have died in the last 3 years believing that Christmas decorations were chocolate.
<br /><br />British Hospitals reported 4 broken arms last year after cracker pulling accidents.
<br /><br />101 people since 1999 have had broken parts of plastic toys pulled out of the soles of their feet.
<br /><br />18 Brits had serious burns in 2000 trying on a new jumper with a lit cigarette in their mouth.
<br /><br />A massive 543 Brits were admitted to A&amp;E in the last two years after opening bottles of beer with their teeth.
<br /><br />5 Brits were injured last year in accidents involving out of control Scalextric cars.
<br /><br />And finally...
<br /><br />In 2000 eight Brits cracked their skull whilst throwing up into the toilet.
<br /><br />IF YOU'RE PROUD TO BE BRITISH SEND THIS ON!

<br /><br />She burst  out of the room and ran down the corridor screaming. An older doctor stopped her and asked what the problem was; after listening to her story, he calmed her down and sat her in another room.
<br /><br />Then the doctor marched down the hallway to the first doctor's room. &quot;What the hell's wrong with you?&quot; he demanded. &quot;This woman is 63 years old, she has two grown children and several grandchildren, and you told her she was pregnant?!!&quot;
<br /><br />The new doctor continued to write on his clipboard and without looking up said:  &quot;Does she still have the hiccups??&quot;

<br />(e.g., &quot;Steady as she goes&quot; or &quot;She's listing to starboard, Captain!&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />Recently, a group of computer scientists (all male) announced that computers should also be referred to as being female. Their reasons for drawing this conclusion follows: 
<br /><br />Five reasons to believe computers are female: 
<br /><br />No one but the Creator understands their internal logic. 
<br />The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else. 
<br />The message &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; is about as informative as, &quot;If you don't know why I'm mad at you, then I'm certainly not going to tell you.&quot; 
<br />Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval. 
<br />As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. 
<br />However, another group of computer scientists (all female) think that computers should be referred to as if they were male. 
<br /><br />Their reasons follow: 
<br /><br />They have a lot of data, but are still clueless. 
<br />They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they ARE the problem. 
<br />As soon as you commit to one you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have obtained a better model. 
<br />In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on. 
<br />Big power surges knock them out for the rest of the night.

For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also     called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.   
<br /><br />The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.  
<br /><br />Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of &quot;cocktails&quot;, &quot;highballs&quot; and just a good old-fashioned &quot;stiff drink&quot;. Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.

<br /><br />DEC 20th
<br /><br />It's starting to snow. The first of the season and the first we've seen for years the wife and I took out our hot toddies and sat on the porch watching the fluffy soft flakes drift gently down clinging to the trees and covering the ground. It's so beautiful and peaceful.
<br /><br />DEC 24th
<br /><br />We awoke to a lovely blanket of crystal white glistening snow covering as far as the eye could see. What a fantastic sight, every tree and bush covered with a beautiful white mantle. I shovelled snow for the first time ever and loved it. I did both our driveway and the pavement. Later that day a snowplough came along and accidentally covered up our driveway with compacted snow from the street. The driver smiled and waved. I waved back and shovelled it away again. The children next door built a snowman with coal for eyes and a carrot for a nose, and had a snowball fight, a couple just missed me and hit the car so I threw a couple back and joined in their fun.
<br /><br />DEC 26th
<br /><br />It snowed an additional 5 inches last night and the temperature dropped to around minus 8 degrees. Several branches on our trees and bushes snapped due to the weight of the snow. I shovelled our driveway again. Shortly afterwards the snowplough came by and did his trick again. Much of the snow is now a brownish-grey.
<br /><br />JAN 1st
<br /><br />Warmed up enough during the day to create some slush which soon became ice when the temperature dropped again. Bought snow tyres for both our cars. Fell on my a * rse in the driveway. Went to a physio but nothing was broken.
<br /><br />JAN 5th
<br /><br />Still cold. Sold the wife's car and bought her a 4x4 to get her to work. She slid into a wall and did considerable damage to the right wing. Had another 8 inches of white sh * te last night. Both vehicles are covered in salt and iced up slush that b *stard snowplough came by twice today. Where's that bl * ody shovel?!
<br /><br />JAN 9th
<br /><br />More f *cking snow. Not a tree or bush on our property that hasn't been damaged. Power was off most of the night. Tried to keep from freezing to death with candles and a paraffin heater which tipped over and nearly torched the f *cking house. I managed to put the flames out but suffered 2nd degree burns on my hands. Lost all my eye brows and eyelashes. Car hit a f *cking deer on the way to casualty and was written off.
<br /><br />JAN 13th
<br /><br />F * king baxtered white sh * e just keeps on coming down. Have to put on every article of clothing just to go to the post box. The little c * nts next door ambushed me with snowballs on the way back - I'll shove that carrot so far up the little p *icks a r* e it'll take a good surgeon hours to find it. If I ever catch the a *s ehole that drives the snowplough I'll chew open his chest and rip out his heart with my teeth. I think the ba *t ard hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shovelling and then he accelerates down the street like Michael &quot;f *c king&quot; Schumacher and buries the f *c king driveway again.
<br /><br />JAN 17th
<br /><br />16 more sodding inches of fu *k ing snow and f* cking ice and f *c king sleet and god knows what other white sh * e fell last night. I am in court in 3 months time for assaulting the snowplough driver with an ice-pick. Can't move my fu *k ing toes. Haven't seen the sun for 5 weeks. Minus 20 and more f *c king snow forecast.
