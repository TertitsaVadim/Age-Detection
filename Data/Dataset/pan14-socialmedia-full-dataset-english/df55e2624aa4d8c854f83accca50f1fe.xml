<br /><br />Why did you have to go and leave me here this way?
<br />Did you have to die so soon especially 5 days before christmas day?
<br />I know you were in pain!
<br />I wouldn't put you through it again.
<br />But if i knew back then,
<br />What i know right now,
<br />I'd give you a hug and tell you to go to the doctors.
<br />You were so fragile and yet so unbreakable,
<br />So happy but unhappy.
<br /><br />I remeber having a feeling you had cancer,
<br />and crying,
<br />And then i knew you were going to die
<br />But when dad told us over the phone you had cancer i was calm.
<br />I remeber the summer when dad carried you out of the car 
<br />And through the house to the back garden,
<br />Dad saying you were heavy,
<br />And then it was my tea time i was eating my tea and annette got some,
<br />After my tea i was swinging on my chair and i went flying off,
<br />It was the first time i seen you laugh so hard in ages,
<br />I loved your croaky little laugh.
<br /><br />But then i remember the smell,
<br />It was a horrible smell,
<br />The smell of someone dying.
<br />Then 5 days before christmas auntie Jane phoned,
<br />And mum and dad were at work so auntie jane had to phone work,
<br />Mum phoned home and told me,
<br />I was screamin ''NO NO NO '' 
<br />i was so upset.
<br /><br />Then the funeral i wasn't allowed to sit next to mum and dad,
<br />I wasn't allowed in the family car either,
<br />I had visions of jumping on the coffin when we were leaving to the cemetary,
<br />And then when you were gettin burried dad broke down,
<br />Mum wasn't allowed to hug him,
<br />I felt like giving him a hug,
<br />I felt like jumping in after the coffin.
<br />It has been 4 years since you passed away,
<br />And i still haven't gotten over it.
<br /><br />This poem is for my nanna 
<br />when i was writng it i was thinking of my nanna tears tripping me up.

<br /><br />From his evil eyes
<br /><br />I'm so afraid now
<br /><br />I'm starting to cry
<br /><br />He finds me weeping
<br /><br />Calls me ugly words,
<br /><br />He says its my fault
<br /><br />He suffers at work.
<br /><br />He slaps and hits me
<br /><br />And yells at me more,
<br /><br />I finally get free
<br /><br />And run to the door
<br /><br />He's already locked it
<br /><br />And i start to bawl,
<br /><br />He takes me and throws me
<br /><br />Against the hard wall
<br /><br />I fall to the floor
<br /><br />With my bones nearly broken,
<br /><br />And my daddy continues
<br /><br />With more bad words spoken,
<br /><br />'I'm sorry!', I scream
<br /><br />But its now much to late
<br /><br />His face has been twisted
<br /><br />Into a unimaginable shape
<br /><br />The hurt and the pain
<br /><br />Again and again
<br /><br />O please God, have mercy!
<br /><br />O please let it end!
<br /><br />And he finally stops
<br /><br />And heads for the door
<br /><br />While i lay there motionless
<br /><br />Brawled on the floor
<br /><br />My name is chris
<br /><br />I am three,
<br /><br />Tonight my daddy
<br /><br />Murdered me
<br /><br />And you can help
<br /><br />Sickens me top the soul,
<br /><br />And if you read this
<br /><br />and don't pass it on
<br /><br />I pray for your forgiveness
<br /><br />Because you would have to be
<br /><br />One heartless person
<br /><br />To not be effected
<br /><br />By this Poem
<br /><br />And because you are effected,
<br /><br />Do something about it!
<br /><br />So all I ask you to do
<br /><br />Is pass this on!
<br /><br />IF YOU ARE AGAINST CHILD ABUSE

<br />So If You Find Anything Go To Your Doctor As You Do Not Want To Pass Away In A Terrible Way Such As This As It Is Hard Enough To Watch...
<br />So Do Not Hesitate Or It May Be Too Late The Awareness In Young Girls Such As Myself Is Not As High As It Should Be And Now I Think It Is About Time We Make A Difference And Spread The Awareness Of Such A Dreadfull Disease....
<br /><br />I Can Remember It Like Yesterday The Smell,
<br />The Mixed Feelings,
<br />The Atmosphere,
<br />The Time Of The Year,
<br />The Way She Looked,
<br />The Pain She Was In,
<br />Drifting In And Out.
<br /><br />This Is Something No Young Child Should Ever Have To See. 
<br />My Youngest Brother Has Only Grown Up With One Grandparent As My Grandad John Passed Away, My Grandad Dennis Is An Arsehole Who Has Nothing To Do With Us, He Was Too Young To Remember My Nana. Which Is Not Fair On The Wee Soul, Everyone Should Have A Chance To Meet Their Grandparents. I Grew Up With Six....
<br /><br />All We Have Left Is My Granny Who Would Do Anything For Us Which We Love For It...
<br />Just Whatever You Do, Do Not Forget About The Risks Of Cancer Or The The Family Who Stand By You Through It All....
<br /><br />If You Have It Live Your Life To The Full....
<br />Give Each Child, Grandchild, Neice, Nephew, Partner Or Bestfriend Something To Remember You By.....
<br />Explain To Them In A Manner They Will Understand....
<br />And Don't Show Them Your Fear Or They Will Just Get Themselves Upset....
<br /><br />Thank-you For Reading....
<br /><br />Nana ??- 20/12/03

<br />You can call me:
<br />&quot;redneck&quot; ,&quot;hillbilly&quot;, &quot;slaker&quot; , &quot;Cracker&quot;, &quot;Honkey&quot;, &quot;Whitey&quot;, &quot;Gringo&quot; , &quot;wonderbread&quot;, &quot;birdshit&quot; and you think it's OK.
<br /><br />...But when I call you coon, jiggaboo, Kike, sand nigger, rag head ,Towelhead, WOP, Camel Jockey, Gook, nigger, slant eyes or Chink you call me a racist.
<br /><br />-You say that whites commit a lot of violence against you, so why are the ghettos the most dangerous places to live?
<br /><br />-You have the United Negro College Fund.
<br /><br />-You have Martin Luther King Day.
<br /><br />-You have Black History Month.
<br /><br />-You have Cesar Chavez Day.
<br /><br />-You have Yom Hashoah
<br /><br />-You have Ma'uled Al-Nabi
<br /><br />-You have the NAACP.
<br /><br />-You have BET.
<br /><br />-If we had WET(white entertainment television) ...we'd be racist.
<br /><br />-If we had a White Pride Day... you would call us racist.
<br /><br />-If we had white history month... we'd be racist.
<br /><br />-If we had an organization for only whites to &quot;advance&quot; our lives... we'd be racist.
<br /><br />-If we had a college fund that only gave white students scholarships...you know we'd be racist.
<br /><br />-In the Million Man March, you believed that you were marching for your race and rights. If we marched for our race and rights...you would call us racist.
<br /><br />-Did you know that some high school students decided to make a club for only the white students because the other ethnicities had them... they all got sent to court for being racist but the african-american, Latino, and Asia clubs were not even questioned.
<br /><br />-You are proud to be black, brown, yellow and orange, and you're not afraid to announce it. But when we announce our white pride, you call us racists.
<br /><br />I am white.
<br /><br />I am proud.
<br />But, you call me a racist.
<br /><br />Why is it that only whites can be racists?
<br /><br />Now watch, I'll be a racist for posting this
<br /><br />So what? no one will re post this for fear of being called racist
<br /><br />if you think its true re-post it saying
<br />'' I'm not racist but its true '

<br /><br />Guy: No, this is fun.
<br /><br />Girl: No it's not. Please it's too scary!
<br /><br />Guy: Then tell me you love me.
<br /><br />Girl: Fine I love you. Slow down!
<br /><br />Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.
<br /><br />Girl : *hugs him*
<br /><br />Guy: Can you take my helmet off and put it on yourself? It's bugging me.
<br /><br />Girl: Alright, now slow down
<br /><br />Guy: I love you babe
<br /><br />(in the paper the next day):
<br />A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it, but only 1 had survived.
<br /><br />The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him and felt her hug one last time, then he had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.
<br /><br />If u love any one this much re-post this ....and....the love of your life will relize they feel the same .... DONT BREAK THIS . 2morow will be the best day of your life.
<br />However, if u don t post this by at least 1:00 tonight, you will have bad luck in your love life 4 the rest of your life

<br /><br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid. 
<br /><br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons. I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it. 
<br /><br />You're a 90's kid if: 
<br /><br />You can finish this [ice ice _ _ _ _ ] 
<br /><br />You remember watching: 
<br />-Doug 
<br />-Ren &amp; Stimpy 
<br />-Pinky and the Brain 
<br />-saved by the bell 
<br /><br />You've ever ended a sentence with the word &quot;PSYCHE!&quot; 
<br /><br />You just cant resist finishing this . . . &quot;Iiiiiiin west philidelphia born and raised . . .&quot; *sings* 
<br /><br />You remember: 
<br />-Dinosaurs, 
<br />-Boy Meets World, 
<br />-sabrina the teenage whitch. 
<br /><br />You remember when it was actually worth getting up early 
<br />on a Saturday to watch cartoons. 
<br /><br />supermarket sweep. 
<br /><br />You remember reading &quot;Goosebumps&quot; 
<br /><br />You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school. 
<br /><br />You still get the urge to say &quot;NOT&quot; after (almost) every sentence . . . not 
<br /><br />when everyhting was settled by: 
<br />-rock paper scissors. 
<br />-turn around, tutch the ground... 
<br />-ip dip doo the cats got the flu... 
<br /><br />when playing 'house' was a daily activity. 
<br /><br />when we played Hide and seek/kiss catch until our legs grew numb. 
<br /><br />when we used to obey our parents 
<br /><br />You used to listen to the radio all day long just to record your FAVORITE song of ALL time. 
<br /><br />Captain Planet. He's a Hero. 
<br /><br />You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the Red ranger, were meant to be together. ??? 
<br /><br />when daytime t.v was all learning stuff for kids, that your parents made you watch if you stayed off school. 
<br /><br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genisis became popular. 
<br /><br />You always wanted to send in a tape to britain's Funniest Home Videos . . . but never taped anything funny. 
<br /><br />You remember watching Home Alone 1, 2 , and 3 . . . and tried to pull the pranks on &quot;intruders&quot; 
<br /><br />You remember watching: 
<br />-The Magic roundabout 
<br />-kipper the dog 
<br />-button moon 
<br /><br />You remember when Yo-Yos were cool. 
<br /><br />You remember those Where's Wally books.

<br />-the 1st Batman 
<br />-Aladdin 
<br />-Ninja Turtles 
<br />-3 Ninjas movies. 
<br />-Ant, Dec &amp; Cat on SMTV Live!!! 
<br /><br />when starburst were called opalfruits. 
<br /><br />If you remember when every thing was &quot;da BOMB!&quot; 
<br /><br />When they made the new lunchables so that you could make pizza AND tacos. 
<br /><br />...and even the boys loved steps and spice girls. 
<br /><br />You remember boom boxes vs. cd players. 
<br /><br />Making those little paper fortune cookie things, and then predicting your life with them. 
<br /><br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot; 
<br /><br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere. 
<br /><br />. . . Furbies. 
<br /><br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the internet. 
<br /><br />And Windows 95 was the best. 
<br /><br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, and Ninja Turtles. 
<br /><br />Michael Jordan was a king. 
<br /><br />YIKES pencils and erasers were the stuff! 
<br /><br />You remember when the new Beanie Babies and Talking Elmo were always sold out 
<br /><br />You collected those Beanie Babies. 
<br /><br />Carebears. 
<br /><br />Gap was the coolest stuff invented. 
<br /><br />You had a pair of popper trackies. 
<br /><br />Jellybean shoes. 
<br /><br />Everything was inflatable from bags, chairs, sofas, aliens... 
<br /><br />Coats were puffy and aluminous. 
<br /><br />You could by everything with £1. 
<br /><br />The old, old £20 
<br /><br />oasis was the 'new' thing. 
<br /><br />You collected all the Troll dolls 
<br /><br />If you even know what an original walkman is. 
<br /><br />You remember wanting to sit on the orange Nickelodeon couch. 
<br /><br />You've gotten creeped out by &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; 
<br /><br />You know the Macarena by heart. 
<br /><br />&quot;Talk to the hand&quot; . . . enough said 
<br /><br />You always said, &quot;Then why don't you marry it!&quot; 
<br /><br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace. 
<br /><br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground. 
<br /><br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . . 
<br /><br />Before the Internet &amp; text messaging . . . 
<br /><br />Before creatives &amp; iPods . . . 
<br /><br />Before emos and chavs. . . :S 
<br /><br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . . 
<br /><br />Before Spongebob . . . 
<br /><br />Back when you put off the 5 hours of homework you had every night. 
<br /><br />When light up trainers were cool. 
<br /><br />When everyone wore visors. 
<br /><br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs. 
<br /><br />Caller ID was a new thing. 
<br /><br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs. 
<br /><br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkman. 
<br /><br />When checking out drawing books and that one book about the rainbow fish from the library was THE cool thing to do. 
<br /><br />You had slap braclets! 
<br /><br />Way back. 
<br /><br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear. 
<br /><br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!
