<br />Where you have told me so many lies 
<br />Do I want to stay with you
<br />Will you ever love me true

<br />Ill always love you no matter what

<br />How could you have the heart to put me through all that pain
<br />And act like everything is still the same
<br />All this has made me so confused

You look around and see others in their new uniforms with neatly ironed creases and bold colors. You look back at yourself you suddenly feel out of place, like every one knows that your poor, so poor that you can’t afford a new uniform. But little do they know your uniform feels like the world to you just like what their uniform feels to them. This is what I call a minor case of New Zealand child poverty. New Zealand child poverty isn’t as serious as in the third world countries but it is similar.
<br /><br />What does child poverty mean to children in poverty? 
<br />Well for children poverty means missing out on what most of us take for granted.
<br />For example not being sure of 3 meals a day, suitable clothing or not being able to heat      the house in winter or missing out on school outings and not being able to bring home projects from tech classes because you haven’t paid the fees or it could just cause social isolation, feelings of worthlessness, loneliness and alienation. 
<br />It can also cause kids to drop out of school too early and therefore are more likely to be unemployed-even for high ability students, also kids under-achieving at school because of under eating which causes short attention spans 
<br /><br />What happens when things get tight?
<br />When money runs short it is still possible to get on with life. Most of your parents would have heard of the food bank. Food banks are great places to go to when you need a helping hand food wise. Some people find it humiliating living on hand outs all the time but the food bank is not a hand out; because you cant just live on the food bank day in and day out. The reason is that food banks give you the bare minimum to survive so you still have to go out and try and earn a living and I’m sure that if you were in the position of having to go to the food bank you probably rather get a job. The poorest people don’t own a house. Most won’t even be renting. They sleep in friend’s garages and in their cars. After Christmas 2003 on average 10 families a week had nowhere to go.     
<br /><br />Who are out to stop it?  
<br />Well I’m just one of thousands of people that think child poverty is completely outrageous. There are celebrities out to stop it like Blind Spot   (Band), Dave Dobbyn   (Singer), Frankie Stevens   (Singer), Judy Bailey   (Former One News Presenter), Milan Borich   (Singer from Pluto), Opshop   (Band), Shane Cortese   (Actor, Dom off Shortland Street), All Blacks (NZ Rugby team)
<br /><br />There are also organizations out to stop it like CPAG (child poverty action group), CYFS (child youth and family), Child Welfare, Social Welfare, Make poverty history and Habitat for humanity. You all know the guy off the condom add with the catchy rap a but you probably don’t know that he is also trying to cut down child poverty by reducing the pregnancies of young people like us that aren’t financially capable to raise a child. But not all child poverty is caused by children giving birth to children it can also be caused by an illness or disability of the main breadwinner in a family which means the under qualified members have to go to work and end up in dead end jobs that pay next to nothing. One particular true story has come to my attention. It’s about a girl by the name of Sarah-Anne Black. She lived in Ngaruawahia she was about 2 or 3 when her dad, the main income in the family, got sick with Bi Polar which caused him to get depressed and violent very easy, this happened a lot, so they were very low on money. 
<br /><br />Most of you in this room would have gone to school in new, flash clothes she went to school in clothes from the Op shop, you probably also had a large group of friends her friends were the walls of the classroom. Her mum couldn’t take her dads violence because she was constantly protecting the kids, taking the punches and dealing with the bruises so she left and took the kids with her. Sarah and her two brothers lived mainly with their mum and made organized visits to see their dad. Sarah’s mum was on the benefit, due to her still not working, and was trying her best to re qualify her self so that she could go to work. 
<br /><br />Sarah, who would have been about 6 or 7, was constantly being beaten up and bullied at school along with her older brother Michael who would have been about 8 or 9. They were being bullied because of the way they looked and the clothes they wore no one bothered to get to know them they just judged them by their appearance and their often visits to the nest (the food bank in Hamilton). Her mum was constantly being stalked by her ex-husbands family. She had already met a friend over the internet and was contemplating over the idea of moving over to Rotorua and the drama with her ex-husband made the decision for her so they moved. Her mum got a full time job and had a steady income. Sarah made a few friends at her new school. Her mum met someone in Whakatane his name was Mike Anderson they moved up there about two years after they met. Her mum got a high paying job and mike worked at the board mill so they had a very steady income. They still get short on money today but with two incomes there’s always a way through it.
<br /><br />You are probably wondering how you can help. Well if you are wondering how to help people in need such as Sarah and others overseas white bands are available online at  Oxfam, World Vision and TEAR fund and offline from the Leprosy mission and Trade aid
<br /><br />Thank you for listening. I hope I made a difference to your outlook on child poverty in New Zealand

<br />I hope we did you proud grandad
<br />we all love you
<br />R.I.P we miss you heaps.

<br />And remembered what you said.
<br />You told me nt to drink, Mum 
<br />So i had a sprite instead.
<br />I felt proud of meself,
<br />The way you saud i would,
<br />That i didnt drink and drive, 
<br />Though other friends said i should.
<br />I made a healthy choice,
<br />And your advice was right,
<br />The party finally ended,
<br />And the kids drove out of sight.
<br />I got into my car,
<br />Sure to get home in one peice,
<br />I never knew what was comming, Mum
<br />Something i expected least.
<br />Now i lying on the pavement,
<br />And i hear the policeman say,
<br />The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,
<br />Mum his voice seems so far away.
<br />My own blood is all around me,
<br />As i try hard not to cry,
<br />I  can hear the paramedic say,
<br />This girl is going to die.
<br />Im sure the guy had no idea,
<br />While he was flying high,
<br />Because he chose to drink and drive,
<br />Now i would have to die.
<br />So why do people do it, Mum
<br />Knowing that it ruins lives?
<br />And now the pain is cutting me,
<br />Like a hundred stabbing knives.
<br />Someone should have taught him, 
<br />That its wrong to drink and drive.
<br />Maybe if his parents had,
<br />Id still be alive.
<br />My breath is getting shorter, Mum
<br />Im getting really scared,
<br />Theses are my final moments,
<br />And im so unprepared.
<br />I wish that you could hold me Mum,
<br />As i lie here and die.
<br />I wish that i could say &quot;I love you Mum!&quot;
<br />So i love you and goodbye.
