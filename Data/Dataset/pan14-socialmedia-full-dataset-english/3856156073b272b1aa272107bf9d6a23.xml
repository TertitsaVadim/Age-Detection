<br /><br />(feat. Snoop Dogg)
<br /><br />[Akon:] Convict...Music...and you know we up front. 
<br /><br />[Chorus: Akon] 
<br />I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
<br />I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br /><br />[Snoop Dogg] 
<br />Money in the air as mo’ fell 
<br />Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
<br />Don’t tell, wont tell, baby say “I don’t talk, Dogg unless you told on me” - oh well 
<br />Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon’ do
<br />Baby stick to me and I’ma stick on you
<br />If you pick me then I’ma pick on you
<br />d-o-double g and I’m here to put this d*** on you 
<br />I'm stuck on p**** and your’s is right
<br />Rip ridin’ the poles and them doors is tight 
<br />And I’ma get me a shot ‘fo the end of the night 
<br />Cuz p**** is p**** and baby you’re p**** for life
<br /><br />[Chorus: Akon] 
<br />I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
<br />I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br /><br />[Akon] 
<br />Shorty I can see you ain’t lonely
<br />Handful of n***** and they all got cheese
<br />See you lookin’ at me now what its gon’ be 
<br />Just another tease far as I can see
<br />Trynna get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs
<br />Throwin’ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cuz I'm far from a scrub
<br />And you know my pedigree, ex-deala use to move phetamines
<br />Girl I spend money like it don’t mean nuthin’ and besides I got a thing for you. 
<br /><br />[Chorus: Akon] 
<br />I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor, 
<br />I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know girl
<br /><br />[Snoop Dogg] 
<br />Mobbin' through the club and I’m low pressin’ 
<br />I’m sittin’ in the back in the smoker’s section (just smokin’) 
<br />Birds eye, I got a clear view
<br />You can’t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you) -mm
<br />It’s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your p* is wet 
<br />You’re rubbin’ your back and touchin’ your neck
<br />Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
<br />Your t****** is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin’ at me
<br /><br />[Akon] 
<br />Girl and while your looking at me I’m ready to hit the caddy
<br />Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
<br />Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
<br />Wantin’ to just give you everything and that’s kinda scary
<br />Cuz I'm lovin the way you shake your ass
<br />Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass 
<br />Lil' mully(<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> don’t get caught up too fast 
<br />But I got a thing for you
<br /><br />[Chorus: Akon] 
<br />I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor, 
<br />I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br /><br />[Chorus: Akon] 
<br />I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor, 
<br />I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br />I wanna love you, you already know 
<br /><br />girl...

<br />Let's show 'em some love
<br />Welcome to Detroit
<br /><br />[Chorus - Eminem]
<br />Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
<br />Throw them hands up and show some love
<br />And I Welcome you to Detroit City
<br />I said Welcome to Detroit City
<br />Every place, everywhere we go
<br />Man we deep everywhere we roll
<br />Ask around and they all know Tricky
<br />That's what's good man they all say Tricky
<br /><br />[Verse 1 - Eminem]
<br />Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
<br />You can hear 'em holla Goon Squad in this bitch
<br />Let me hear you holla Goon Squad in this bitch
<br />Let me hear you holla Runyon Ave. in this bitch
<br />So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
<br />And the situation gets a little sticky
<br />I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
<br />I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
<br />Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
<br />Come to the club, meet me out front
<br />There's some chump up in this bitch
<br />Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
<br />And we may have to fuck his ass up
<br />Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
<br />And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
<br />So homie come get me, Chedda boys what up though I see you
<br />Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
<br />Where you at man, let me see them hands in the sky
<br />Detroit motherfuckers 'till we die
<br /><br />[Chorus - Eminem]
<br />Where's my gangstas and all my thugs
<br />Throw them hands up and show some love
<br />And I Welcome you to Detroit City
<br />I said Welcome to Detroit City
<br />Every place, everywhere we go
<br />Man we deep everywhere we roll
<br />Ask around and they all know Tricky
<br />That's what's good man they all say Tricky
<br /><br />[Verse 2 - Trick Trick]
<br />Homie it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
<br />Marshall call me the fifty ?? and laced the track
<br />This the beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
<br />My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
<br />My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
<br />And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
<br />Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
<br />Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
<br />You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
<br />All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
<br />Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
<br />I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
<br />Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
<br />A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
<br />And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
<br />Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
<br /><br />[Chorus - Eminem]
<br /><br />[Verse 3 - Trick Trick]
<br />Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
<br />From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
<br />I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
<br />I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
<br />So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
<br />The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
<br />Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
<br />Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
<br />I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
<br />And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
<br />I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can fear me
<br />Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
<br />So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
<br />He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
<br />So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
<br />And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us
<br /><br />[Chorus - Eminem]
<br /><br />[Outro]
<br />Yeah, Trick Trick
<br />Eminem, Wonder Boy, Shady
<br />It's goin' down baby
<br />Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
<br />Damn right I said my nigga
<br />That's my nigga
<br />Tricky

<br /><br />why must my three keep out of sight

<br /><br />i wish instead i were nine
<br /><br />for nine could thwart this evil trick
<br /><br />with just some quick arithmetic
<br /><br />i know i'll never see the sun
<br /><br />as 1.7321
<br /><br />such is my reality 
<br /><br />a sad irrationality
<br /><br />when,hark,just what is this i see ?
<br /><br />another square root of a three
<br /><br />has quietly come waltzing by 
<br /><br />together now we multiply
<br /><br />to form a number we prefer
<br /><br />rejoicing as an integer
<br /><br />we break three from our mortal bonds
<br /><br />and with a wave of magic wands
<br /><br />our square-root signs become unglued
<br /><br />and love for me has been renewed
<br /><br />but you denied to be my square root of a three

<br />I'm just trying to make ends meat nigga break bread
<br />So lay here play dead while I shake 'em down
<br />Ripping your pockets taking your profit don't make a sound
<br />If murder made me rich a nigga then I be a killer 
<br />If robbin' rappers was my practice I know how to get'cha
<br />I'm from the struggle so you know it's in my blood to hustle
<br />I gotta make something bubble while I muscle through the jungle
<br />My everyday itinerary could be plenty scary
<br />But yes it's nessacery we take penitentiary chances
<br />Fuck it what's the risk especially when the killin (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> me

<br />When I'm feeling hellish and rebel'n boy I split ya melon
<br />Cash rules everything around me, green get the money
<br />If you got to put the beam on him plug him (fuck him)
<br />Record executives take heed to this early warning
<br />You play with the paper you betta believe we put the hurting on ya
<br />Droping the curtain on ya your future is certain murda

<br />Me and my Girlfriend Lyrics:
<br />[girl] 
<br />Sheeit, ju motherfuckin right
<br />I'm the bitch that's keepin it live and keepin it hot
<br />when you punk ass niggaz don't
<br />Nigga Westside, WHAT! Bring it on
<br /><br />[Tupac] 
<br />Look for me
<br />Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
<br />Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
<br />Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
<br />Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
<br />Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
<br />Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
<br />Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
<br />Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
<br />Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
<br />exorcisin all demons
<br />Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
<br />We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
<br />Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
<br />Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
<br />to bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
<br />Make the frontpage primetime live on TV
<br />Nigga my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
<br />One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop
<br /><br />[girl] 
<br />What!! I'm bustin on you punk ass niggaz *automatic gunfire*
<br />Run nigga run! *gunfire* I'm on yo' ass
<br />nigga! *gunfire continues*
<br />Run nigga, duck and hide! Nigga I'm bustin all you bitches!
<br />Run nigga, yeah! Westside! Uh uh uh! Die nigga die!
<br /><br />[Tupac] 
<br />My girlfriend, blacker than the darkest night
<br />When niggaz act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
<br />Nigga my girlfriend, though we seperated at times
<br />I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
<br />Picked you up when you was nine, started out my life of crime
<br />wit you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
<br />It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
<br />that I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend
<br /><br />[Chorus: Tupac] 
<br /><br />All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
<br />Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
<br />[repeat 2X] 
<br /><br />[Tupac] 
<br />I was too immature
<br />to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
<br />Caused so many arguments and strays
<br />Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
<br />Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
<br />We closer than the hands of time,
<br />deeper than the drop of mankind
<br />I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
<br />In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
<br />We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
<br />Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
<br />loaded by my bedside crazy
<br />Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone
<br />anticipated for the moment you come home
<br />I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
<br />I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
<br />So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
<br />You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend
<br /><br />[Chorus] 
<br /><br />[Tupac] 
<br />I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
<br />When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
<br />Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
<br />While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
<br />I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
<br />the only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
<br />Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
<br />Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
<br />Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
<br />Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
<br />No control, down to roll, unleash
<br />After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
<br />Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
<br />Just hold me down, baby witness the power
<br />Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
<br />Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend
<br /><br />[Chorus 3X] 
<br /><br />Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
<br />Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
<br />Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
<br />Raised in the whirlwind -- look for me
<br />[repeat 3X] 
<br /><br />Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
<br />Me and my girlfriend
<br />[repeat 2X] 
<br /><br />ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND!

<br />Did you have to go
<br />And leave my world so cold
<br /><br />Everyday I sit and ask myself

<br />I thought I heard you cry
<br />Asking me to come
<br />And hold you in my arms
<br />I can hear your prayers
<br />Your burdens I will bear
<br />But first I need your hand
<br />Then forever can begin

<br />I'll never give up
<br />I'll let 'em live in
<br />They sinnin'
<br />They pretend to be tough, Pretend to be touched,
<br />Pretend to be blessed
<br />They want money and women, it's never enough
<br />Take in a breath slow nobody knows just too much
<br />You better be good, you know im from the hood and so,
<br />We give 'em the dough
<br />Fired out, laughin' up
<br />When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
<br />And to the grave, I been one of the brave
<br />Not one of the slaves, and one of the paid,
<br />And I'll be one of the saved, stay hatin' the fake
<br />On the television runnin' 'round tellin' niggas be ready for hate,
<br />Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
<br />I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
<br />Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
<br />And swallow my pride it's all about heartache, hard to break
<br />Lost mommy, poppy left home
<br />I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
<br />Sit listenin in the back and tellin his selection
<br />His date is probably,
<br />Probably my mommy,song,
<br />Cryin for the life of you gone,
<br />Just me and my destiny let's roll, let's roll
