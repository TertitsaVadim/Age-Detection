Freed, Bickslow and Elfman were left in the camp to manage the wounded people. However, they didn't believe that intruders will attack them.<br /><br />The two main intruders are Yomazu and Kawazu. Gajeel single-handedly beat them, so it would be easy for the three you need to do the same. Nevertheless, even if the sting is on Fairy Tail's aspect, Freed, Bickslow and Elfman still had a tough time fighting them. It's basically weird, but maybe Gajeel is actually stronger than the three ones combined. I visually enjoyed the fight scene and allow 5 stars to your effects and assaults.<br /><br />Let's now jump within the greatest the main episode, Purehito versus Natsu! The battle was actually awesome, so let's make Fairy Tail some sort of round of applause to your impressive and remarkable choreography of results and battles with this episode! At to begin with, Natsu fired whatever he's got, preparing a gigantic blast of energy. The power that they got from Laxus has a great contribution using Natsu's confidence today. Purehito didn't know what you can do and was blown away by Natsu's evolution.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Purehito won't allow anyone defeat him or her, not even Natsu! Just as soon as you thought Natsu will kick this outdated guy's butt, you're mistaken! Purehito managed for you to stand still and absorbed the significant attacks of Natsu. Really, he's really scary right now, he just laughed and in many cases removed his observation patch, signalling a far more frightening power getting Natsu's way. Everybody was devastated on precisely what they saw, they can't believe that someone can survive those attacks.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Carla, Happy and Panther Lily discovered something into the ship, something that can help them defeat Purehito. It's identified as the &quot;Devil's Heart&quot; (Akuma simply no Shinzo), it's to be a generator with an organic heart, deeply contained within the engine rooms. Hence the name with his guild &quot;Grimoire Heart&quot;, dealing make sense today.<br /><br />You can at this point see from Natsu's encounter that he's moreover scared for everyone's lifestyles, but he snapped from the jawhorse and encouraged everyone not to ever lose hope! A lot of flashbacks of his fight with Gildarts had been showed. The Gildarts as well as Natsu fight has made a necessary part to his development being mage. I guess, it's still a considerable ways to go before this battle comes to an end. Be sure to watch the next attack, the battle involving Purehito and Natsu continues, here in TailedFox!<br /><br />Monte Woodward is a freelance writer for magazines and entertainment websites such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YWlsZWRmb3guY29tL3Jldmlldy1mYWlyeS10YWlsLWVwaXNvZGUtMTE5" target="_blank">TailedFox</a> discussing issues such as &quot;Fairy Tail episode 119 - closer look&quot; and other topics.
