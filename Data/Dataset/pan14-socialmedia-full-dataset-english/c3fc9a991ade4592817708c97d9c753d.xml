<br /><br />Biel, 30, tells InStyle in its August cover story that Timberlake, 31, helps choose her outfits – and picked out her gorgeous engagement ring without any input from her.
<br /><br />&amp;quot;I had no say whatsoever [in the ring]. I don't micromanage,&amp;quot; <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Clothing</strong></a> she tells InStyle, on newsstands Friday. &amp;quot;He is fearless in his choices and has a real eye for design. And I'll be honest: He has better taste than I do.&amp;quot;

<br /><br />Adds Biel, &amp;quot;When I walk out of the closet after getting <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNob3Bzb25saW5lLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Store</strong></a> dressed in the morning, I'll go like this [turns palms upward as if to say, 'Well?'] And he goes like this [shakes his head no]. Then he picks again. It's hilarious.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Fashion feedback aside, Biel says her advice for having a happy relationship is &amp;quot;letting go of the little stuff. You can't let it get to you.&amp;quot; Plus, being with an inspiring person is key to her happiness. &amp;quot;It is important to me to have a partner who is loving and fun – someone who inspires me,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;And he must be a good person.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Asked about whether she plans to raise children someday in Los Angeles, where she and Timberlake currently live in the Hollywood Hills, the actress who <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNob3Bzb25saW5lLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Store</strong></a> was raised in Colorado says, &amp;quot;I would like those future little people to have the experience I had, in some capacity. It was fun. I love Colorado; I've always thought that could be a possibility for me.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />PHOTOS: Stars Snap Their Sparklers
<br /><br />Making Time for Each OtherIn addition to being raised in the outdoorsy environment of her home state, Biel says she learned a lot about relationships growing up by watching her mom and dad. 
<br /><br />&amp;quot;The best thing I learned from [my parents] is that you have to put your relationship first. You need to make time for your partner,&amp;quot; she says. It's really easy to let that go by the wayside. It's easy to say, 'Hey, I'll see you later. I love you.' And you can't do that.&amp;quot;
<br /><br />Biel finds this especially difficult because of the demanding schedules she and Timberlake have because of their work. &amp;quot;Justin and I have a rule that we don't let a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Shop Online</strong></a> certain amount of time go by without seeing each other, but it doesn't always work,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;But from here on out, I want to participate in making smart choices for the relationship.&amp;quot;

<br /><br />One by one, the housemates stood up and randomly picked a category that their question would come from. They were then able to choose items to play for, such as ‘champagne’ and ‘beer'.
<br /><br />The housemates did surprisingly well and managed to correctly <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online Shop</strong></a> answer 9/12 questions. Housemates who let the team down were Luke S who thought that people “visit Mars” and Becky who didn’t know that a ham and pineapple pizza was called a ‘Hawaiian’.
<br /><br />Following their high score, Big Brother then gave the housemates <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Clothes</strong></a> the chance to win back one of the three items that they didn’t manage to earn.

<br /><br />The music legend told a BBC reporter &quot;There's things in the works - I think it's definitely happening, But when? I can't say yet.&quot; The guitarist was reluctant to reveal too <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online Shop</strong></a> much more but he did go on to admit that he's been enjoying rehearsals with Mick Jagger and co:
<br /><br />&quot;We're playing around with the idea (of a tour) and had a couple of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXRyZW5jaGNvYXRzc2FsZWUuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Coats</strong></a> rehearsals - we've got together and it feels so good.&quot;
<br /><br />Fans will have to wait for the tour though as earlier this year it was reported that the band have pushed back their live dates until 2013.
<br /><br />The legendary band will celebrate their 50th <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnVyYmVycnlvdXRsZXRzdG9yZS5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online</strong></a> anniversary tomorrow as they played their first ever gig in London on July 12, 1962. Earlier in the year, according to NME Ronnie Wood said that he and his bandmates owed it to their fans to hit the road together and suggested that the group were on the verge of touring, but back in March Rolling Stone magazine reported Keith Richards as saying: &quot;Basically, we're just not ready. I <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Clothes</strong></a> have a feeling that's [2013] more realistic.&quot;

<br /><br />&quot;She's actually there to prove to the world there's more to her, and she's got the ability to do this job really well. She's taken the role really seriously.&quot;
<br /><br />Complimenting the 'Hit Me Baby One More Time' hitmaker, the media mogul told X17 Online: &quot;She's working out great, I mean, all these reports that we've fallen <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online</strong></a> out, it's nonsense.

<br /><br />The 24-year-old actress, who is dating Jamie Bell, has posted a video of the procedure on YouTube for her fans to see.
<br /><br />Scroll down for video...
<br /><br />Deep breath: Evan Rachel Wood seen in a YouTube video <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Clothing</strong></a> of her getting her nose pierced recently in Venice Beach, Los Angeles
<br /><br />Wood is in visible and audible pain during the clip, where she is seen contorting her face and moaning.
<br /><br />After the stud is in, she say: 'Ah, f***.'
<br /><br />'Special thanks to Victor at House of Ink in venice beach on the boardwalk, for piercing my nose,' the former True Blood actress tweeted.
<br /><br />'I must warn you, do not watch that last video if you are <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNob3Bzb25saW5lLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Store</strong></a> squeamish,' she added.
<br /><br />Wood and boyfriend Bell were spotted last week enjoying a bike ride in the Venice neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
<br /><br />They shared a kiss and a tender embrace in between riding along the Venice Boardwalk and doing a little shopping on Thursday afternoon.
<br /><br />That hurts: The actress is heard in audible pain as the is put in

<br /><br />Meanwhile Jamie, 26, dressed in black jeans, a grey sweater and matching pageboy hat.
<br /><br />The British actor, who could not keep his hands off of his lady love, is clearly in love and wants the world to know.
<br /><br />Earlier this week he tweeted: 'I believe, yesterday.... was &amp;amp;quot;THE&amp;amp;quot; Perfect Day,' adding, 'Home is wherever I'm with you...'

<br /><br />As Political Animals' former First Lady-turned-Secretary of State <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free On Sale</strong></a> Elaine Barrish Hammond, Sigourney Weaver is back in badass form, only on a civic-duty level rather than a sci-fi one. And although she has three names and a philandering ex-husband, Elaine is not based on you-know-who. &quot;I had to get over the slight feeling of, 'Oh, it's Hillary,' which she really isn't,&quot; says Weaver, citing inspiration from countless women in power, including a childhood headmistress and yes, Mrs. Clinton. &quot;We need more female <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free</strong></a> leaders like Hillary...women bring a different spirit to leadership. It's much more 'Roll up your sleeves and let's get it done.'&quot; As for what drew her to this work, her first TV gig since 2009's Prayers for Bobby, let's just say she knows a meaty role when she sees one. &quot;I haven't read material this satisfying in a long time,&quot; she says. &quot;It was like being offered a big juicy steak after you've been a vegan for five years.&quot;
<br /><br />USA's six-hour miniseries about the messy world of a D.C. dynasty rounded out by Elaine's boozy mother (Ellen Burstyn), her libidinous, bigoted former president ex-husband Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds) and their twin sons - engaged political strategist Doug (Lone Star's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 3</strong></a> James Wolk) and openly gay train wreck TJ (Captain America star Sebastian Stan) - could be written off as Primary Colors: The Good Wife Edition. But executive producer Greg Berlanti has forged a richly layered and addictive tale of power and familial ties that mixes the heart of his Jack &amp; Bobby with the dysfunction of his Dirty Sexy Money. &quot;There'd never been a former first family on TV before, so I thought it would be interesting to look at what it means to be 'out <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcG5pa2VmcmVlZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Running Shoes</strong></a> of power,'&quot; says the self-professed political junkie. &quot;There's also a lot of wistfulness in the show, and I think the country is experiencing a bit of that right now. Like, 'Man, the '90s were awesome!'&quot;

<br />But after falling unwell yesterday, the singer pulled out of a scheduled appearance at GuilFest in Surrey just minutes before she was due to take to the stage.
<br />Party girl: Tulisa was in Ibiza celebrating her 24th birthday and settling a court case against her ex-boyfriend Justin Edwards
<br />Happy birthday: After enjoying her big day on the White Isle, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free On Sale</strong></a> Tulisa pulled out of GuilFest just minutes before she was due on stage
<br />Tony Scott, organiser of the annual music event, said: 'We got a message from Tulisa's team just beforehand saying she was unwell and could not make it.More...What were you thinking? Tulisa continues her 24th birthday celebrations in Ibiza but fails to sparkle in unflattering outfitToo hot for a hangover: Tulisa Constavlos tries to ease her suffering after birthday <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free</strong></a> celebrations by cooling off in the pool in Ibiza Birthday girl Tulisa blows out her candles as she puts legal battle behind her and celebrates turning 24 in Ibiza
<br />'Theysaid she was really sorry and would love to come back next year.I thinkGuilFest is one of Tulisa's favourite gigs and this would have been herthird time in a row.
<br />'Ithink she was genuinely upset at not being able to perform but if somebody is not very well, they are not very well. You have to be 100 per cent when you get up on the stage.
<br />A-list travel: Tulisa chartered a private jet to transport her pals from London to Ibiza for their two-day break
<br />'She is a favourite among fans at GuilFest and we hope she can <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 3</strong></a> do a set for us next year. I am sure she wanted to play and was genuinely Ill. It is one of those things that happens to every artist.'
<br />However, fans of the former N-Dubz singer weren't quite so forgiving after seeing pictures of Tulisa tearing it up on the White Isle over the past two days.
<br />Terry Cooper, 22, said: 'I think it's a disgrace. We have all seen the pictures of Tulisa partying in Ibiza.
<br />Hungover? Tulisa looked more than a little worse for wear as she <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcG5pa2VmcmVlZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Running Shoes</strong></a> relaxed by her private pool the day after her 24th birthday celebrations
<br />'If she is well enough to drink she is well enough to perform.'
<br />Tulisa reportedly pulled out of her planned appearance just 30 minutes before she was due to take to the stage, meaning fans were left watching Take That tribute band, Take Fat, in her place.
<br />The 24-year-old singer has since apologised for letting her fans down, and explained she is 'on the mend'.
<br />Writing on her Twitter page, she said: 'So sorry I had to cancel at Guilfest guys. I was really unwell. Hate letting down my fans but I genuinely couldn't perform. Im on the mend X'
<br />The singer's spokesperson also confirmed that Tulisa had been feeling under the weather, and said: 'Tulisa was very unwell yesterday and had to pull out of her Guilfest appearance. She is on the mend today though.'

<br /><br />VMG states in the suit:
<br /><br />&quot;The portions of &quot;Love Break, which have been copied into Vogue and all its various &quot;mixes,&quot; &quot;remixes&quot; videos, YouTube versions, etc. are numerous but intentionally <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free On Sale</strong></a> hidden. The horn and strings in Vogue are intentionally sampled from &quot;Love Break&quot; throughout…
<br /><br />The unauthorized sampling was deliberately hidden by [Madonna] within &quot;Vogue&quot; so as to avoid detection. It was only when VMG specifically looked for the sample, with the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free</strong></a> technology available to it in 2011, that the sampling could be confirmed.&quot;
<br /><br />The company has also revealed that Music producer Richard &quot;Shep&quot; Pettibone, who worked on Vogue with Madonna, was originally hired by VMG to remix versions of Love Break…
<br /><br />Oooopsie!!!!
<br /><br />VMG is seeking damages as well as the $$$ Madge made <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 3</strong></a> off Vogue AND its various remixes.
<br /><br />And obviously, that is a sh*tload of dollahs!
<br /><br />It may make no difference if you're black, white, boy OR girl, and even if you ARE a superstar, you can't go around stealing other people's jamz and sell them as your own!
<br /><br />Oh, we HOPE these claims are false, Madgey! Or <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcG5pa2VmcmVlZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Running Shoes</strong></a> how will we ever Vogue the same way again?!

<br />Doug Kapustin, for USA TODAY
<br />Stage Manager Troy Thornes, right, assists Bob Schieffer, CBS News' chief Washington correspondent, as the veteran reporter prepares to host 'Face the Nation' from the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online Shop</strong></a> network's Washington studio on Sunday.
<br />Sponsored LinksThe Sunday morning news shows are such a staple of presidential politics that it's more remarkable when a candidate has not appeared on them than otherwise. Each week, congressional leaders, campaign strategists and administration officials sit down for interviews under the lights of Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week, Fox News Sunday and State of the Union. Combined, they're watched by close to 10 million people — including virtually all the political apparatus of Washington — in what George Stephanopoulos, the host of ABC's This Week, calls a &quot;civic ritual.&quot;
<br />The ritual is largely unchanged since NBC's Meet the Press, the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXRyZW5jaGNvYXRzc2FsZWUuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Coats</strong></a> oldest show, went on the air in 1947. Watch a Meet clip from 1956 of diplomat Claire Booth Luce dodging questions about her political plans and it's not that different from, say, Obama chief of staff Jack Lew refusing to call the health care mandate a tax earlier this month during a grilling by Fox News' Chris Wallace.
<br />PHOTOS: Behind the scenes at Sunday morning talk shows
<br />STORY: Sunday show hosts have their say 
<br />What has changed is the rest of the political conversation. This year, in what Stephanopoulos dubs &quot;the full Twitter election,&quot; the cascade of instantaneous, incremental news — driven by Twitter, online news sites including Politico and the Huffington Post, and the constant churn of communication from political campaigns — has cast the Sunday shows into the role of quote factories and meme generators, a jumping-off point for a week of political haggling. The Sunday shows provide <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnVyYmVycnlvdXRsZXRzdG9yZS5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online</strong></a> not the last word in politics, but the opening remarks.
<br />&quot;They used to be the place where you went to hear very important people discuss very serious issues and be cross-examined by serious journalists. Now that function is something that happens in political discourse in all kinds of ways, especially digital,&quot; says Alex Jones, head of Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
<br />University of Virginia political scientist and frequent cable talker Larry Sabato watches the Sunday shows and often tweets about them at the same time. &quot;Those morning chat shows used to dominate the Sunday evening news and the Monday news cycle,&quot; he says. &quot;In this rapidly moving Twitterverse, there are three or four news cycles just on Sunday.&quot;
<br />In May, for example, on Meet the Press, Newark Mayor Cory Booker called Obama's attacks on Bain Capital &quot;nauseating,&quot; a comment out of step with the Democratic line. Booker's hasty backtracking went out on Twitter two hours later and his rebuttal video was up on YouTube by dinnertime.
<br />On July 15, in the midst of Democratic-fanned controversy over when Mitt Romney left Bain, Romney adviser Ed Gillespie went on two shows to say the Republican nominee had &quot;retired retroactively,&quot; and by noon (as the Obama campaign happily reported), &quot;#retroactively&quot; was the top trend on Twitter.
<br />They're still standing
<br />The news cycle for all media has been obliterated by the digital revolution: newspapers and magazines no less than broadcast TV, but the Sunday shows are unique for their role in national politics. They provide a predictably timed, deep well of news from the most prominent <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Clothes</strong></a> people in public affairs, a heap of information and commentary that can be sliced and diced by news outlets and by the Obama and Romney campaigns for days.
<br />Snippets of the Sunday shows turn up in campaign ads — not just the guests but the hosts, as Bob Schieffer discovered when he saw himself in an ad that ran during the Face the Nation broadcast July 15. The hosts are, of course, media stars: Politico runs a weekly feature called &quot;Turn the Tables,&quot; interviewing them.

<br />On This Week's viewers vs. Good Morning America's:
<br />&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;They're seeing it as a civic ritual, there's no question about that. They also want to be engaged and entertained to some degree by the conversation and they want to feel like they're part of the conversation. … I think of somebody drinking their second cup of coffee,<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free 3.0</strong></a>  feeling they're sitting at the table with us. I literally do imagine people jumping in (to the TV discussion) with points of their own. During the week (when Good Morning America airs), it's people running around in their robes scarfing down half a piece of toast and pushing the kids toward the school bus while getting ready for work. You really have to hit one thing you want them to know.&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;

<br />Age 75
<br />Host since 1991
<br />On what he wants guests to talk about:
<br />&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;We're now immersed in this (political) gridlock where nothing gets done anymore. The question I'm trying to get answered here is, 'But what are you going to do — what <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 2</strong></a> can you do — to get this government functioning again?'

<br />On the echo effect of the Sunday news programs on the Twitterverse:
<br />&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;It's always had that sort of impact, particularly because of the nature of the programs. It's political discourse, it's political gamesmanship … that becomes grist for the mill, and now for the blogosphere.

<br />CNN: State of the Union
<br />Candy Crowley
<br />Age 63
<br />Host since 2010
<br />On whether Sunday shows are entirely inside-baseball:
<br />&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;The Sunday shows are political shows They are driven by, certainly, what's the talk of the town. But I like to think we're talking about what folks want to hear that affects their lives. Sure, folks inside the Beltway are watching to see what people say about them and what they need to put out a press release about. But that's not who I'm talking to. I really am sort of talking to my mother.&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;

<br />Age 64
<br />Host since 2003
<br />Fox News Sunday declined to comment for this article. In December, Wallace told Playboy magazine that his show is politically impartial:
<br />&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;I defy anybody to look at my interviews with the Republican <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNuaWtlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free</strong></a> candidates this year or with, for instance, (Obama senior adviser) David Plouffe and say I was pushing an agenda.

<br />The bloodshed, which coincided with an intensifying of the conflict in neighboring Syria, pointed up the deficiencies of the Iraqi security forces, which failed to prevent insurgents from striking in multiple locations across the country.
<br />As well as the scores of deaths, at least 268 people were wounded by <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 3</strong></a> bombings and shootings in Shi'ite areas of Baghdad, the Shi'ite town of Taji to the north, the northern cities of Kirkuk and Mosul and many other places, hospital and police sources said, making it one of Iraq's bloodiest days in weeks.
<br />No group has claimed responsibility for the wave of assaults but a senior Iraqi security official blamed the local wing of al Qaeda, made up of Sunni Muslim militants hostile to the Shi'ite-led government, which is friendly with Iran.
<br />&quot;Recent attacks are a clear message that al Qaeda in Iraq is determined to spark a bloody sectarian war,&quot; the official said, asking not to be named.
<br />&quot;With what's going on in Syria, these attacks should be taken <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free</strong></a> seriously as a potential threat to our country. Al Qaeda is trying to push Iraq to the verge of Shi'ite-Sunni war,&quot; he said. &quot;They want things to be as bad as in Syria.&quot;
<br />Iraq, whose desert province of Anbar, a Sunni heartland, borders Syria, is nervous about the impact of the conflict in its neighbor where mainly Sunni rebels are fighting to end President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite-dominated rule.
<br />The Iraqi government said on Monday it rejected Arab League calls for Assad to quit, saying it was for the Syrian people alone to decide his fate and others &quot;should not interfere&quot;.
<br />Arab League foreign ministers meeting in Doha earlier in the day offered Assad a &quot;safe exit&quot; if he stepped down swiftly.
<br />Baghdad advocates reform in Syria, rather than endorsing calls by Sunni-ruled Gulf nations for Assad's removal.
<br />The last two days of attacks in Iraq shattered a two-week lull in violence <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free On Sale</strong></a> in the run-up to the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, which Iraqis began observing on Saturday.
<br />Sectarian slaughter peaked in 2006-2007 but deadly attacks have persisted while political tensions among Iraq's main Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish factions have increased since U.S. troops completed their withdrawal in December.
<br />&quot;I ask the government if security forces are capable of keeping control,&quot; a man named Ahmed Salim shouted angrily at the scene of a car bomb in Kirkuk. &quot;With all these bloody bombs and innocent people killed, the government should reconsider its security plans,&quot; he told Reuters Television.
<br />TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION
<br />White House spokesman Jay Carney said despite the attacks, Iraq is not as nearly as violent as it once was.
<br />&quot;The fact that there remains violence in Iraq is certainly the case, and we condemn these attacks, but it is also the case that the Iraqi security forces have been trained up and do have the capacity to handle their own security,&quot; Carney told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.
<br />The security forces themselves were often the targets or victims of the assaults perpetrated across Iraq.
<br />Gunmen using assault rifles and hand grenades killed at least <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcG5pa2VmcmVlZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run Shoes</strong></a> 16 soldiers in an attack on an army post near Dhuluiya, 70 km north of Baghdad, police and army sources said.
<br />In Taji, 20 km north of Baghdad, six explosions, including a car bombing, occurred near a housing complex. A seventh blast there caused carnage among police who had arrived at the scene of the earlier ones. In all, 32 people were killed, including 14 police, with 48 wounded, 10 of them police.

<br />The 24-year-old suspect, who has not been named, was arrested in the Cypriot port city of Limassol on July 7, on suspicion of tracking the movements of Israeli tourists. He is a Swedish national of Lebanese origin.
<br />Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday the man had been planning an attack similar to the suicide bus bombing in the Bulgarian city of Burgas last Wednesday.
<br />Cypriot Justice Minister Loucas Louca told reporters in Nicosia on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>cheap nike free shoes</strong></a> Monday: &quot;There are some similarities between the behavior of the suspect, and the terrorist attack in Bulgaria.
<br />&quot;We have not concluded yet, the investigation must finish.&quot;
<br />Netanyahu told the U.S. &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; television program that the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of the Cyprus suspect was similar to that used by the Burgas bomber.
<br />He said he had &quot;rock-solid&quot; intelligence that Lebanon's Hezbollah group, backed by Iran, was responsible. Tehran has denied any involvement.
<br />Louca said the suspect was a member of an organization, which he did not <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXJ1bmVycy5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free Run 2</strong></a> name. The man has been widely reported to be a member of Hezbollah, classed as a &quot;terrorist&quot; organization by Israel and the United States, but not by the European Union or Cyprus.
<br />The suspect on Monday appeared at a Limassol court which ordered his remand until Friday pending completion of police inquiries.
<br />He was held on suspicion of espionage and conspiring to commit a crime, said those present at the hearing, held behind closed doors with only police and his lawyer present.
<br />Authorities are investigating 10 charges against him, they said, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZW9uc2FsZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Free 3.0</strong></a> without giving further details.
<br />The suspect was arrested at a hotel two days after his arrival from London. Lists of locations frequented by Israeli tourists were found on him, according to media reports which have not been disputed by authorities.
<br />A senior Cypriot government source said he was picked up after a tip-off from British intelligence.
<br />The suspect has not been charged. Under Cypriot law police can obtain court-sanctioned detention orders at regular intervals until an investigation is concluded either <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcG5pa2VmcmVlZXIuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Cheap Nike Free</strong></a> by formal charges or the release of the detainee.

<br />The new embargo rules require EU countries to search planes and ships, starting from Tuesday, if they suspect they are carrying arms, dual-use goods or equipment used for repression to Syria.
<br />&quot;These sanctions are important because they will allow ships to be examined to see what cargo they're carrying, and that will prevent, I hope, any arms reaching Syria,&quot; EU foreign <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lYnVyYmVycnlvdXRsZXRzdG9yZS5jb20v" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online</strong></a> policy chief Catherine Ashton said at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.
<br />The EU decision sharpens differences with Russia, which has provided the Syrian government with weaponry and has blocked Western moves to get a U.N. Security Council resolution threatening Syria with sanctions.
<br />All 27 EU countries must enforce the sanctions - including Cyprus, which some Western diplomats suspect is used by Russia as a shipment route to supply arms to Assad. Cypriot President Demetris Christofias has dismissed this idea as &quot;fairy tales&quot;.
<br />Ashton said it would be up to EU governments to implement cargo <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXRyZW5jaGNvYXRzc2FsZWUuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Coats</strong></a> inspections, which British Foreign Secretary William Hague said should damage Assad's access to weapons.
<br />&quot;I hope it will mean that the European Union will be more effective together at preventing any flow of arms to the Syrian regime,&quot; he said.
<br />The tighter EU sanctions could also make it more difficult to supply weapons to Assad's opponents. U.S. intelligence officials say weapons funded by sympathizers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are crossing the Lebanese border to the rebels.
<br />The new sanctions include a ban on the Syrian national airline that will prevent the flag carrier landing at EU airports, although it will still be able to fly over EU countries and make emergency stops.
<br />Ministers added 26 people, mostly military officials, to a list of those <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNzdG9yZW9ubGluZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online Shop</strong></a> subject to EU travel bans and asset freezes. The bloc had already imposed sanctions on 49 organizations and 129 people in Syria. Details of these measures were due to be made public on Tuesday.
<br />With violence escalating, Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal said the presence of chemicals weapons in Syria was a major concern.
<br />&quot;The turmoil could also expand to the stocks of chemical weapons,&quot; he said. &quot;The sense of urgency is only on the increase. The stocks of chemical weapons are <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeXNob3Bzb25saW5lLmNvbS8_" target="_blank"><strong>Burberry Online Store</strong></a> part of the story.&quot;
<br />Some foreign ministers said the time had come to start thinking about how to help a post-Assad Syria.

<br />You have to take a shot every 24 seconds, and the shots we took happened to be hit.
<br />- Coach Krzyzewski after USA rout of Nigeria
<br />In basketball each team is obligated to shoot. The teams that win are those that do some combination of:
<br />Shooting wellkeeping the ballgetting the ballKeeping the opponent from shooting well 
<br />You’ll notice these line up with Dean Oliver’s four factors. In the USA’s victory over Nigeria team USA shot the ball amazing well, in particular Carmelo Anthony shot well. Nigeria also shot terribly. Team USA also did remarkably well in keeping the ball with only seven turnovers and even more importantly, Nigeria turned the ball over twenty-five times! An almost perfect performance may indicate that Coach K is a genius that may be able to get Carmelo’s true potential to shine. (I’d also argue moving the three point line closer helps too.)
<br />Over at Courtside Analyst, Ty has a slightly more critical take of Coach K after a narrow win against Lithuania.
<br />Coach K is proving to be one of those coaches who doesn’t understand the importance of size and possessionary basketball, and overvalues scoring and the mythical “shot creation”.
<br />Running down the box score there’s a pretty simple explanation – team USA had a pretty bad shooting night and Lithuania shot very well. In terms of possesion basketball, team USA did the same thing they did against Nigeria, they forced a lot of turnovers and didn’t turn the ball over.
<br />Of course, Ty’s point is very simple – Coach K doesn’t valuerebounding(and defense). Kevin Love and Tyson Chandler are both top 15 in rebounding in the NBA. Yet, Coach K played them a mere 20 minutes. In fact, Lithuania out-rebounded team USA.
<br />Coach K, like many, recognizes that efficient use of possesions can mean superior scoring. However, there are other ways to be effective. Rebounding is valuable because it gets you the ball. In fact, it’s not really any different than a steal. In both cases you have the ball and the opponent doesn’t. However, the research suggests that rebounding has no significant value when it comes to getting players draftedout of the NCAA. It’s not surprising that Coach K, a prominent NCAA coach, doesn’t seem to notice them. Still, the USA has a huge advantage with them and if they want to avoid more close calls maybe they can have less Kobe and more rebounding?

First up: Gary Harding and the staff from Eyes on Isles bring us their essentials for the New York Islanders.)
<br /><br />By Gary Harding, Eyes on Isles
<br />Player: Mike Bossy
<br />There have been so many players that received the ultimate honor of the Hall of Fame -- Bryan?Trottier, Billy Smith, Denis Potvin, Clark Gillies.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9ha2xleXN1bmdsYXNzZXNzYWxlcy5jb20v" target="_blank">oakley sunglasses discount</a>		 But to us, Bossy was the one. ?He averaged 50 goals a season (NO ONE WILL EVER REACH THAT FEAT) for his career; and if his aching back did not get the best of him, could have given The Great One a run for his money for the goal scoring titles.
<br />Season: 1992-1993 (This may not be a popular choice, but …)
<br />Winning four straight cups was outstanding, nineteen straight playoff series victories (ANOTHER RECORD THAT WILL NEVER BE BROKEN), but for me the expectations of<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uaWtlZnJlZXNob2VzZXMuY29t" target="_blank">cheap nike free shoes</a>		 1993 were not?necessarily?visible, until the last few weeks of the season, when the team just amazingly jelled together. Then came the three overtime victories against the Caps, then the big win in Game 6 that saw Dale Hunter lay a nasty hit on Pierre Turgeon.?Then the dramatic victory against the Stanley Cup Champ Pittsburgh Penguins. Darius Kasparitis making Mario Lemieux his little '[expletive]'. Then the pass from Ray Ferraro to David Volek to 'seal the deal'.
<br />This series meant a lot to me (my relationship with my wife began that year), and I enjoyed<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5idXJiZXJyeWNsb3RoZXNzYWxlLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Burberry Clothing</a>		 those two months in 1993 as much as the Cup victories.
