<br />and how you listened to my pleading cries
<br />and all those times you let me fall
<br />remember how you watched it all
<br />Now I sit here and think about the times I bled
<br />and you only watched the tears that I shed
<br />I want to trust you, I want to feel
<br />My heart was broken, and it still won't heal
<br />you've torn a hole that can never mend
<br />and its depth, I doubt you'd comprehend
<br />You called me stupid, then begged for love
<br />As if I were an angel from up above
<br /><br />Remember how we used to kiss
<br />you hid your lies in passionate bliss
<br />and remember how you'd hold me tight
<br />and dream of her all through the night
<br />I'm sick of this, now let me go
<br />I won't show you love, I hope you know
<br />you're too busy to care about my emotions
<br />and my promises of faithful devotion
<br />Guess what, my sweet, you can cry
<br />because it's time for me to say goodbye
<br />I'm tired of representing another girl
<br />but I wanted to be part of your world
<br />guess its too late, so leave me be
<br />I'm not yours anymore. I am free.

<br />Your eyes are beautiful,they remind me of the colors of the evening sky. Your gaze is upon me, it draws me closer to you. I come closer but soon break away, 'fore I get hypnotized from that warm sparkle in your eye.
<br /><br />When I think about you, it seems like I'm frozen in time. You're the only one I see...no one else seems to exist. I sit there staring into space. Just thinking about you,no one else.
<br /><br />When I come back in time, it surprises me to know what's going on-around me. Everything is moving fast...as time ticks&amp;tocks...things move even faster. It's noisy, there's lots of confusion, time is trying to catch up with itself.
<br /><br />I stand with a gaze in my eye, a gaze that can tell everything about me...Determined-Lovely-and Bold!
<br /><br />As I stand &quot;now&quot; and watch time take place, all I can think about is YOU. How I just want to be with you, just Me and You...Wishing that my heart belonged to you. Hoping that someday it WILL.

<br />Would you still be my friend?
<br />Would you still look at me the same way?
<br />Would you still tell me everything?
<br /><br />If I told you I would die for you
<br />Would you still look at me in class just for a smile?
<br />Would you still come to me for advice?
<br />Would you still call me just to say hi?
<br /><br />If I told you you're the only one for me 
<br />Would you still give me hugs just to make me feel better?
<br />Would you still make a fool out of yourself just to make me laugh?
<br />Would you still tell me your feelings, and no one else?
<br /><br />If I told you I think of you always
<br />Would you still sing to me?
<br />Would you still make songs for me on the guitar?
<br />Would you still stand up for me when I need it?
<br /><br />If I told you I've felt this way for long
<br />Would you still hold the door for me?
<br />Would you still try to boost up my self-esteem?
<br />Would you still tell me I'm beautiful?
<br /><br />If I told you I dream of you
<br />Would you still say I make you happy?
<br />Would you still tell me your hopes and dreams?
<br />Would you still say you missed me when I'm gone?
<br /><br />If I told you I loved you
<br />Would you say you love me too?

<br />not even a soul to kiss 
<br />alone alone I often moan
<br />why is my heart all a miss
<br /><br />Then I remember the soaring pain
<br />that short time you held me tight
<br />all a rush of deep ache again
<br />and now once more I wish to feel your light
<br /><br />Now I ride the emotional crashing wave 
<br />and remember not to remember
<br />so in future once more I can be brave
<br />and remember not remember!

<br />A pretty stone

<br />when you looked at me that way.
<br />There was a tear in your eye,
<br />and your lips were in a pout.
<br /><br />I had to catch my breath,
<br />when you kissed me last night.
<br />You whispered in my ear,
<br />something you've never said before.
<br /><br />My hand trembled again,
<br />when you put it on your heart.
<br />I could feel everything you had,
<br />all you wanted to give me.
<br /><br />I couldn't see anymore,
<br />when you wiped the tears from my eyes.
<br />You said you were leaving me,
<br />but you just didn't know how to say goodbye.

<br />A time for new experiences, some to love, or maybe hate.
<br />A summer love holds a lifetime of memories
<br />In just a few short months 
<br />Memories were made while we laughed together, cried and changed.
<br />Oh, the things that can happen during those summer months 
<br />Things that bring joy, like the first time you touched me or gave me a gentle kiss.
<br />Or things that bring disappointment, like the seperate lives we are forced to live. 
<br />Expectaions come and our time together slipped away. Just like summer we knew it would soon fade. 
<br />The color of the leaves started to change with our lives. 
<br />But never will i forget how we looked at the stars so bright 
<br />So i wished upon a shooting star My final wish for you,
<br />May happiness find you wherever lifes crazy turns take you 
<br />And i hope you have many more summer loves, especially if it's with 
<br />That special someone!
<br /><br />I have yet to fix some things in this poem, but i just can't think of the wording right now. .

<br />You came to me,
<br />And let me see the other side 
<br />of heart and soul.
<br /><br />The light that shines through my window, 
<br />I know I will wake without you there,
<br />But in the night, 
<br />You will come again,
<br />To pour you love onto me once more,
<br />With sweet words and kisses,
<br />That could last forever.
<br />For the cycle will continue each night you come.
<br /><br />But I have never seen your face,
<br />I have to know, 
<br />I have to see,
<br />What my love looks like,
<br />Dear Eros,
<br />They did trick me they told me lies,
<br />I thought of you as a monster, 
<br />But if a monster was a beautiful as you;
<br />I do wish that I could meet monsters more often.
<br /><br />Out the window you flew in rage,
<br />After the candle wax dripped,
<br />Leaving a scar I cannot kiss away,
<br />Without trust what are we,
<br />Without the ones we love beside us,
<br />Where do we go?
<br />Where do I go?
<br /><br />Can I find my way to you and say that I am sorry?
<br />It would be worth it all just to know that you are okay,
<br />Just know,
<br />If you tell me to; I will go far away,
<br />To where you can be happy in your life.
<br />It all becomes too clear, I shall travel to be with you again.
<br /><br />I travel to the house of your mother.
<br />We reached an agreement.
<br />My dear Eros, I will finish the tasks,
<br />Just to see you again.
<br />I will go to Hades and back,
<br />Just to win your favor.
<br />But now, all I can think about is sleep.
<br />Maybe when I wake, I can be beautiful as ever,
<br />Just for you!
<br /><br />You wipe the sleep from my eyes, 
<br />My dear Eros, I see the love in your own.
<br />I cannot help but to cry.
<br />I see all the pain that is stored away in your mind.
<br />All I want is to embrace you and become immortal,
<br />To where, Heart and Soul,
<br />Can forever be

<br />I can see all the things many people doubt
<br />I see how sweet you really are
<br />Inside your a bright shinning star
<br />I can see how much you really care.
<br />Please just let it all come out
<br />It's time to stop holding it back
<br />It's time to stop going without
<br />Your life doesn't need to be black!
<br />You deserve so much more.
<br />I want to be the sun
<br />To brighten your day
<br />The relationship has just begun
<br />The best has yet to come
<br />Isn't that way they say?

<br />The feelings i felt really were true
<br />But when the end of it all came..
<br />I helped myself back up off the ground.
<br />Because all you did for me was push me down.
<br />Yeah the fall was hard and it took me a while
<br />But i did it, i got myself back up
<br />I don't need your help not anymore
<br />All you can do is leave me sore.
<br />You took my heart 
<br />Ripped it apart
<br />Don't worry its not forever
<br />I will find a way to put it back together!

<br />like the flame of the sun.
<br />or of the fire we once sat next to, 
<br />together.
<br /><br />My love,
<br />it weeps,
<br />tears of blood,
<br />they flood my body drowning me, 
<br />in my own love i lose my breath,
<br />like when you touched me.
<br /><br />My love it opens,
<br />it mixes with the love you still hold for me,
<br />the hidden desires that i see behind your eyes,
<br />the love i see,
<br />through all the hate you show.
<br /><br />My love it Shields its self,
<br />form the hateful words you say,
<br />from all other loves,
<br />from the world,
<br />and its endless despair.
<br /><br />my love it dreams,
<br />of the days once spent,
<br />with just me and you,
<br />you and i,
<br />looking no deeper,
<br />than each others eyes.
<br /><br />my love it delights,
<br />at the slightest remembrance, 
<br />of your touches.
<br />it looks for you,
<br />and only you.
<br /><br />my love it suffers,
<br />the endless, 
<br />the destruction, its falling into pieces,
<br />its unbearable pain.
<br /><br />my love it dies,
<br />with the rest of me,
<br />thanks to you,
<br />i die,
<br />a slow painful death,
<br />just as i dreamed of, 
<br />since you left me.
<br /><br />my love flashes,
<br />before my eyes,
<br />a picture flashes,
<br />a picture of you.
<br /><br />my love,
<br />desires,
<br />delights,
<br />dreams,
<br />despairs,
<br />destroys,
<br />dies.
<br />my love belongs to you.
<br />you control my destiny.
