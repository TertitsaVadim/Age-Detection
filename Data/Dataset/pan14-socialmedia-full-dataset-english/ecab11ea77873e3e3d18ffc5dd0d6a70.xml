Most of the time we would go to the nearest lake that had a camp ground and allowed horses, since my family was big horse fans!<br /><br />Usually there would be somewhere between 8 to 10 horse trailers and over a dozen cars that would head out on the expedition. We would leave Friday morning and arrive just a couple hours later at our vacation destination. Mothers, fathers, and kids of all ages would be there. I found that this individual described this really well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fdrumkitsreviews.com%2Fquestions-answers-thinking-starting-play-drums-drum-kit-ideas%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://drumkitsreviews.com/questions-answers-thinking-starting-play-drums-drum-kit-ideas/</a>  page.<br /><br />You didn't have to own a horse to go on our camping trips. We always made the trip be in a place where it wasn't just horse trails. There would be trails for hiking, lakes for swimming or fishing, or nice little areas just to hang out and have fun. There would be a midnight trail ride for the brave and a morning ride for the not so brave.<br /><br />Usually on the midnight rides someone would come up with a really good ghost story and by the time we all would arrive back at camp, we would be scared to death. After storing away all the gear and making sure the horses were comfortable for the night, we would all gather around the campfire where the ghost stories would continue. It was fun to watch the younger kids squirm from being scared but at the same trying to act like brave little souls. You could see them inching closer and closer to who ever they were setting beside.<br /><br />Sometimes us older kids, would hid out in the woods just to make a big scare at the end of the story! The next morning there would be something good on the the camp stoves. Usually homemade biscuits and gravy. My mom could make some mean gravy!<br /><br />The kind that stuck with you all day. After breakfast, it was usually off to the trails again to see what else we could find.<br /><br />Exploring on horse back was awesome. We would ride for somewhere between 3 and 4 hours depending on how hot it was getting. If it was too hot, we would take the horses back and take a jump in the lake. Some of us would even take our horses in to the lake to cool down. Nothing like a good ole lazy summer afternoon spending time with family and friends in mother natures land!

There are lots of options to consider when planning your vacation and they may seem overwhelming. A good starting point might be to think about how you are planning to arrive in this tropical paradise. Since Hawaii is, after all, an island there are only two ways to get there: by sea or by air. When calculating time from California, your choice is between five hours in the air or five days by sea. Now, I know there's a big difference in time, but a Hawaii cruise might be just the excitement and relaxation you're looking for. I found that this individual described this really well on this  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Felectronicdrumkitreview.com%2Fstart-business-game-consoles-playstation-2-xbox-360-nintendo-ds-31%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://electronicdrumkitreview.com/start-business-game-consoles-playstation-2-xbox-360-nintendo-ds-31/</a>  web post.<br /><br />Depending on your preference of travel, a Hawaii cruise might sound much more appealing to you than traveling by plane. It is inevitable that every time you step onto an airplane, even if you did pay top dollar for first class, you find yourself in an overcrowded area, in close quarters with several hundred people, many who are possibly ill.<br /><br />You probably do everything you can, short of jump off the plane, to pass the grueling five hours. Then once you're off the plane you spend another hour or more enduring airport security and looking for your luggage before you even begin the trip to your hotel. Wow, doesn't sound like a great way to start a relaxing vacation. And just think, you get to do it all over again at the end of your trip, too.<br /><br />Now, visualize yourself heading to your departure point and arriving right at your hotel. No long security lines, no crowded planes. When you travel by ship on a Hawaii cruise it's just like checking into your hotel and relaxing while you head to your destination. You can put your luggage in your room and head straight to the pool deck, enjoy a cocktail, and spend the first five hours of your vacation basking in the tropical sun rather than dodging someone else's germs.<br /><br />When it comes down to it there's really no comparison. I know I would much rather spend my vacation to Hawaii relaxing on a cruise ship than wasting it in an airport. You will return home relaxed and calm from a week of pampering and luxury instead of stressed to the max from a long flight. The choice is yours, spend you days and nights in a luxurious room, enjoying delicious meals on a cruise ship of your preference, and you will truly enjoy your getaway to the paradise of the Hawaiian islands.

A thousand yards from the trailhead is the battle scene. Off the Dallas Highway, the Cheatham Hill Connector is at the west side. Continue to the north of the Dead Angle towards the parking area where you will see a set of cannons near the Texas monument. It shows the Confederates and Union casualties during the attack. The Confederate commander ordered a cease fire from his men to allow his opponents to get their wounded as they were burning to their death. I found that this blog explained this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VsZWN0cm9uaWNkcnVta2l0cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9tdXNpYy1lcXVpcG1lbnQtZW5kb3JzZW1lbnQtZGVhbHMv" target="_blank">Adriana Deshaw</a> post.<br /><br />From the parking lot found at the end of Cheatham Hill Drive, find the trailhead by walking to the south end of the parking lot. Although the trail can be taken whichever way you prefer, start the hike by pacing throughout the trail counter-clockwise. Passing the fence, walk towards Mebane's Tennessee Battery at the right. It offers you a visual of the set of cannons that were used against advancing Yankees during the battle. Move past this and continue to pass through Confederate entrenchments on the left.<br /><br />Then turn right at the base and circle around the path as you turn around to view the monument up close and personal. To the left of this magnificent monument, you will find a small tunnel that the Union troops built. However, they were trapped by the Confederate fire from the entrenchments above the hill as they try to create a tunnel under the Rebel position to quash it.<br /><br />Now continue to climb back to Cheatham Hill Loop. Take the right trail as it leads forward left following the curve of the The Angle's trenches. This is the site where William Tecumseh Sherman lost his partner Union Army officer Dan McCook, who was one of the patriarchs of the &quot;Fighting McCooks&quot;. McCook was also known as one of the two Ohio brothers along with their 13 sons who fought during the Civil War.<br /><br />At this point, expect a moderate descent emerging out to a tom of an unknown Union soldier which was discovered by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1938. Reaching an intersection, turn left from it leading you back to Cheatham Hill Loop which abruptly joins Kolb's Farm Loop. Continue straight ahead taking the Cheatham Hill Loop turning left after leaving the intersection. The trail then leads to an ascent towards the top of the hill and ends at the parking area.

My father and I would sit watching comedy movies and laugh until it hurt and on Fridays in the summer, it was always a given that my parents would take my sister and I to the Drive-In Theater. (Does anyone remember them<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" /> If it was a comedy, that was a double plus for us. So, for me to say that I love comedy movies would be a vast understatement and for me to make a Favorite Top 10 list is literally next to impossible. In fact, making a Top 20 would be hard enough as it is, but I am going to try anyway. I will cover groups of movies and some solo movies and then try to accomplish my feat for the evening. And although this will be my most difficult task to date, I will most definitely enjoy the memories that these movies provide to me and hopefully for you also.<br /><br /><strong>The In-Laws</strong> with Peter Falk and Alan Arkin is so funny and enjoyable. The way that Falk's character slowly gets Arkin's character, Sheldon, involved with all of his CIA shenanigans is priceless. A definite must see for those who have never heard of this gem. &quot;Serpentine Sheldon, serpentine!&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Let It Ride</strong> is one of the most unique comedies I have ever seen, in that, every character is nuts. I mean, in every comedy you have some normal people and then the funny ones. But this movie has no normal people. It takes place at the race track and everyone is a funny character. Richard Dreyfuss is great as Trotter, as he is with every character he portrays. What About Bob?, Moon Over Parador &amp;amp; The Goodbye Girl<strong>,</strong> to name a few, are terrific Dreyfuss movies.<br /><br />Since I already mentioned it, <strong>What About Bob?</strong> is a classic with Dreyfuss and one of my favorites, Bill Murray. I love watching Murray drive Dreyfuss crazy ever so slowly during the course of the movie. 'Baby Steps'. And when you speak of Bill Murray, you have to acknowledge Stripes, Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Scrooged and of course, Caddyshack. What a terrific cast Caddyshack had. It was Harold Ramis' first attempt at directing and he did a fantastic job in making what is now a Golf Country Club classic that had so many memorable lines delivered by the irrepressible Rodney Dangerfield. The war between him and Ted Knight was hysterical. &quot;Hey, who stepped on a duck?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>The Producers</strong> is a Mel Brooks masterpiece and a screenplay Oscar winner. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are so superb in those roles. The idea was to sell much more than 100% of a Broadway play to investors and make sure it is a flop by acquiring the worst script, 'Springtime For Hitler', the worst actors, director, music and anything else to assure a quick closing. This way they could keep the money without paying the investors back. But of course the play is a hit and there is no possible way they can pay everyone back, since they sold about 5000%. So they end up in jail and do they learn their lesson? Nope! They produce 'Prisoners In Love' and sell the warden 200%. While on the subject of Mel Brooks, how can I not list Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, History Of The World Part 1 and another favorite, Blazing Saddles<strong>.</strong> The absolute Best Comedy Western of all time, period. Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Mel Brooks, Slim Pickens and of course, Mongo (Alex Karas). What a blast!<br /><br /><strong>The Pink Panther</strong> movies are some of the best works of the great Peter Sellers. Inspector Clouseau had to be one of the funniest bumbling fools to ever grace the silver screen. A Shot In The Dark, The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Revenge Of The Pink Panther were such great vehicles for Sellers. And on the topic of Peter Sellers, how about Being There, The Mouse That Roared and Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb. Peter Sellers plays 3 roles in this movie and makes them all so funny and memorable, a tribute to his comedic acting genius.<br /><br /><strong>A Day At The Races</strong> with the Marx Brothers would make my Top 5 of all time no matter how long a list I had. I loved the Marx Brothers and this movie is one of my absolute favorites. They were so off the wall and this movie had so many incredible funny scenes. Then you have A Night At The Opera, Monkey Business, Duck Soup and Horse Feathers.<br /><br /><strong>Abbott &amp;amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein</strong> was so great to watch as a kid. Here were the monsters of the times that used to scare us, Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolfman, and now here they were in a comedy with one of the best Comedy Teams of all time. What a treat! That whole scene with Costello in the hotel room and Lon Chaney,Jr has already changed into the Wolfman. Lou didn't know it and is so close to getting killed. A great comedy effect of anticipation.<br /><br /><strong>Sleeper</strong> is a great Woody Allen movie. The premise was he was revived 200 years after being frozen cryogenically. The results were as funny as you would expect from an early Woody Allen movie. Let me also give tribute to Bananas, Annie Hall, What's New Pussycat?, Play It Again Sam, Take The Money And Run and Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask).<br /><br /><strong>Monty Python And The Holy Grail</strong> is a true classic with so many funny and out of the ordinary scenes. I especially loved the scene with the sword fight at the bridge and the loser has his limbs sliced off one by one and yet keeps insisting that he is winning the battle. Even when he is just a torso on the ground he states, &quot;So we'll call it draw then?&quot; Let's also throw in Monty Python's Life Of Brian and Monty Python's Meaning Of Life. On the side, I must mention that if you ever have the time to see a play on Broadway, then by all means go see Spamalot. I laughed the whole entire play and you don't even have to be a Monty Python fan to laugh your fool head off, as I did.<br /><br /><strong>It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</strong> was the first comedy movie of it's kind. It was the first movie with an all star cast like that. Anyone who was anybody in comedy at that time wanted to be in that movie, even if it was just a small cameo appearance. If you weren't in that movie, you weren't on the comedy map, so to speak. One of the great comedy premises for a movie and an absolute amazing cast of actors, headed by Spencer Tracy. A must see for any generation.<br /><br /><strong>The Nutty Professor and The Errand Boy</strong> are terrific comedy performances by Jerry Lewis. I know the word genius is used a lot but Mr. Lewis certainly proves that he is in those two classics. The Nutty Professor remake with Eddie Murphy was fantastic too. A virtual tour de force comedy performance by him with all of his family characters. Plus, I must mention two movies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis together to complete his work: The Stooge and The Caddy. &quot;Whose you're little whosie? Whose you're turtle dove?&quot;<br /><br />Now I would like to write about some comedy movies of more recent times. <strong>There's Something About Mary</strong> is hysterical with so many unique scenes that have never been done before, and in comedy that is extremely hard to do. The scene with Matt Dillon and the dog is one of my most favorite scenes of all time. I literally fell out of my chair laughing at that one. He accidentally kills the dog and tries to resuscitate him by giving him an electric jolt with the live wire from a nearby table lamp. Ben Stiller has really made a name for himself in the business, which makes sense knowing that his parents are Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara. And when talking about Ben you must mention Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and Night At The Museum.<br /><br /><strong>Analyze That</strong> with Billy Crystal and Robert DeNiro was great and though it was a sequel to Analyze This, I loved it even more. The scene when DeNiro comes down to the Shiva with his robe open and nothing on underneath was hysterical. &quot;Hey, who do you have to f*#k around here to get some bacon? Not you I hope.&quot; Mr. DeNiro, as everyone knows, is a tremendous serious actor, but he delivers comedy equally as well, as he did in Midnight Run with Charles Grodin. They were supposed to make a sequel for that but never did. I wish they had. Other Billy Crystal movies I have loved are City Slickers 1 &amp;amp; 2, Mr. Saturday Night and When Harry Met Sally.<br /><br /><strong>Liar, Liar</strong> with Jim Carrey is terrific. But of course, I love Carrey in everything. He is so animated, rubbery faced and one of my favorite comedic actors. I love the outtakes at the end of the movie also. They really show his improvisational abilities well. Then there is Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas and Me, Myself &amp;amp; Irene.<br /><br /><strong>My Cousin Vinny</strong> is a well written and wonderfully acted comedy movie with Joe Pesci, Fred Gwynne and Marisa Tomei. In fact, Miss Tomei won an Oscar for her role. The chemistry between the three of them on screen was terrific, as were all of the courtroom scenes. In the words of the judge, &quot;What's a yute?&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Something's Gotta Give</strong> was very funny with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton. What a great script. I think it should have won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. Of course, you can never go wrong with Jack in the movie. He has such a great face. Even in the horror flick, The Shining, he makes me laugh. The Witches Of Eastwick, Terms Of Endearment, As Good As It Gets, Batman and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and so many more are such an amazing body of work.<br /><br /><strong>Stir Crazy</strong> with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor is absolutely hysterical and their chemistry together was wonderful to watch. They did a few more movies together and they delivered some belly laughs also. Another You, Silver Streak and See No Evil, Hear No Evil<strong>.</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>My honorable mentions, which would definitely make it to my list if I did a Top 100, are Used Cars, Tommy Boy, Lady In Red, Airplane, Weekend At Bernies, Hooper, Smokey and The Bandit, Animal House, Home Alone 1 &amp;amp; 2, Evil Roy Slade, The Naked Gun Movies, Repossessed, Fire Sale, The Road Movies with Bob Hope &amp;amp; Bing Crosby, Carry On Teacher, Arthur, 10, Cheech &amp;amp; Chong's Up In Smoke, Clifford, Meatballs, The Jerk, The Court Jester, The Inspector General, The Birdcage, Neighbors, Porky's, My Favorite Year, Night Shift, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Seems Like Old Times, Easy Money, Back To School, Kentucky Fried Movie, Bachelor Party, Forrest Gump, Toy Story, Chums At Oxford, Police Academy, Trading Places, 48 Hours, Cheech &amp;amp; Chong's Nice Dreams, Start The Revolution Without Me, Gremlins, Lost In America, Defending Your Life, Modern Romance, The Scout, Cat Ballou, Back To The Future, Clue, Beverly Hills Cop, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Fletch, The Golden Child, Crocodile Dundee, Tootsie, Soapdish, A Fish Called Wanda, Good Morning Viet Nam, Coming To America, Mrs. Doubtfire, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Edward Scissorhands &amp;amp; Buck Privates.<br /><br />Whew! As you can see, I pretty much named almost every darn comedy movie ever made but there are so many that I love and I could write about them for a year and not make a dent. And yet, I know that somehow I still may have forgotten some. Anyway, here it finally is:<br /><br /><strong>My Favorite Top 10 Comedy Movies</strong><br /><br />1. The Producers<br /><br />2. It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World I found that this site demonstrated this simply on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2RydW1raXRzcmV2aWV3cy5jb20vYnV5aW5nLXBzMy1nYW1lLw__" target="_blank">Venice Yin</a>  webpage.<br /><br />3. A Day At The Races<br /><br />4. Blazing Saddles<br /><br />5. Monty Python's The Holy Grail<br /><br />6. Liar, Liar<br /><br />7. The Return Of The Pink Panther<br /><br />8. There's Something About Mary<br /><br />9. Abbott &amp;amp; Costello Meet Frankenstein<br /><br />10. The In-Laws<br /><br />Here is my next 10 if I would have made the list a Top 20:<br /><br />11. The Errand Boy<br /><br />12. What About Bob?<br /><br />13. Analyze That<br /><br />14. Dr. Strangelove<br /><br />15. Stir Crazy<br /><br />16. The Nutty Professor (Both Versions)<br /><br />17. Sleeper<br /><br />18. Caddyshack<br /><br />19. Let It Ride<br /><br />20. My Cousin Vinny<br /><br />Well, if I left off something that you would have liked to see on this list...tough. You try to narrow down your favorite genre to a Top 10 and see how far you get. This was definitely the hardest list I ever had to write and the only good thing about it is this: any other Top 10 list I ever write will seem so easy by comparison! Once again, thanks for reading from <strong>THE COMEDY TORNADO!!</strong>

He was also interested in architecture, art-sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music; he was in fact a many-sided genius.<br /><br />Considered one of the greatest painters of all time and definitely the most talented person ever to have lived; in this article we will be mainly focus on two of his greatest masterpieces: &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;<strong>The Last Supper</strong>&lt;/u&gt;: Between 1496 and 1498 Leonardo painted this masterpiece, however it was originally executed in tempera on a badly prepared stucco ground and began to deteriorate a few years after its completion; it was restored on several occasions but it was not until 1908 that Professor Cavenaghi has, in opinion of experts, preserved it from further injury. I found that this blog described this nicely on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hvbWVneW1wbGFuZXQuY29tL3N0cmVuZ3RoLWV4ZXJjaXNlcy1ob21lLWVxdWlwbWVudC00Ni8_" target="_blank">Jaleesa Maclin</a> blog post.<br /><br />The Painting represents the last meal that Jesus had with the Apostles before he was betrayed, captured and killed. Leonardo successfully captured the betray effect in the painting and the gestures of the disciples reveal their temperaments, passions and shock by the realisation that there is a traitor in the group.<br /><br /><strong>&lt;u&gt;The Mona Lisa&lt;/u&gt;</strong>: Once back in Florence, Leonardo started working on the Portrait of &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joconde &lt;/em&gt;by which the portrait is officially known in the Louvre Museum. It is assumed that he started working on the portrait in 1501 and it was finally completed in 1504; even when the completion of the most famous painting in the world took around four years, Leonardo did not paint it for Francesco and Lisa del Giocondo (They commissioned the painting); he painted it for the posterity; the enigmatic Mona Lisa looks like if she is alive and observing us from any angle you look at the painting.<br /><br />An extract of Vasari's eulogy of this portrait clearly reflects the admiration of this work: &quot;...The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, the rose-tints of their colour with those of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood...&quot;<br /><br />A peck of pigment near the left elbow was damaged in 1956 when a young Bolivian named Ugo Unganza Villegas threw a rock at it.<br /><br />On the 22 May 1519, Leonardo da Vinci died, leaving us with an astonishing legacy of art and invention; he will leave forever as the &lt;em&gt;Universal genius &lt;/em&gt;of all time.

I found that this web page explained this smartly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JvYWRiaWtlc3Jldmlld2VkLmNvbS9wb2VtLw__" target="_blank">Venice Yin</a>  web page.<br /><br />The Painting represents the last meal that Jesus had with the Apostles before he was betrayed, captured and killed. Leonardo successfully captured the betray effect in the painting and the gestures of the disciples reveal their temperaments, passions and shock by the realisation that there is a traitor in the group.<br /><br /><strong>&lt;u&gt;The Mona Lisa&lt;/u&gt;</strong>: Once back in Florence, Leonardo started working on the Portrait of &lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joconde &lt;/em&gt;by which the portrait is officially known in the Louvre Museum. It is assumed that he started working on the portrait in 1501 and it was finally completed in 1504; even when the completion of the most famous painting in the world took around four years, Leonardo did not paint it for Francesco and Lisa del Giocondo (They commissioned the painting); he painted it for the posterity; the enigmatic Mona Lisa looks like if she is alive and observing us from any angle you look at the painting.<br /><br />An extract of Vasari's eulogy of this portrait clearly reflects the admiration of this work: &quot;...The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils, might be easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline, the rose-tints of their colour with those of the face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek does not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood...&quot;<br /><br />A peck of pigment near the left elbow was damaged in 1956 when a young Bolivian named Ugo Unganza Villegas threw a rock at it.<br /><br />On the 22 May 1519, Leonardo da Vinci died, leaving us with an astonishing legacy of art and invention; he will leave forever as the &lt;em&gt;Universal genius &lt;/em&gt;of all time.

The definition of the word is really simply, that it is a day free from work. These days however it has come to mean many things to many people. A holiday or vacation should be a chance to get away from normal life, experience something new and just have a break from normal life and recharge the batteries. If your normal life is hectic, then the chances are you are looking for somewhere peaceful, if you work in an office and spend most of your days in front of a computer then you are probably looking forward to some activity.<br /><br />Krabi and Phuket are both popular tourist destinations in the South of Thailand. Phuket has for two decades now been one of the most popular destinations in the world. I in my opinion, that this blog demonstrated this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29tL211YXktdGhhaS10cmFpbmluZw__" target="_blank">thai boxing thailand</a>  webpage.Krabi however has only in the last few years begun to appeal to anyone other than backpackers. But, this is changing. The backpackers who started coming to Krabi twenty years ago are now older, have families and more money and are coming back to the place they fell in love with. They remember what they saw all those years ago, but whereas then they were quite happy to stay in a bamboo hut near to the beach, they now expect an air-conditioned hotel room. Krabi has had to change to accommodate them.<br /><br /><strong>So How are they different?</strong><br /><br />Phuket can offer hundreds of choices of world standard western restaurants, western cinemas and entertainment centers and world class shopping malls, Krabi cannot, Phuket can offer jet skiing and banana boats and the tourist facilities that are offered on the Mediterranean, Krabi can't.<br /><br />But what Krabi lacks is exactly its attraction. No jet skis and banana boats means the coastline is still unspoiled and natural. No private stretches of hotel owned beach mean that every inch of Krabi beach is free to wander.<br /><br />In a way, the two are opposites, Krabi is like an Island on the mainland and Phuket is like the mainland on an Island.<br /><br />The beauty of Phuket is in its nightlife really, there are all the attractions that you would find in most capital cities, there are nice beaches, but as there are so many people, they can be a little crowded. There are also tours and activities, but again, because there are so many tourists in a relatively small place, they can be a little crowded.<br /><br />The beauty of Krabi is that it is a massive area and a small amount of people. The beaches are often empty and pristine and the tours and cultural sightseeing opportunities are somehow a little more authentic when you are not sharing them with one hundred other people.<br /><br />In essence, Krabi is still the place that I visited in 1985. In those days there were only dirt roads in Krabi and no accommodation other than ramshackle beach huts. This is where I learnt to speak English and it's from these young idealistic travellers that I got a taste for travel that I now try to pass onto my children.<br /><br />Although there are now many hotels in all ratings categories, Krabi has managed to hold onto just the essence of that backpacker spirit. The tour industry has begun to develop Krabi's potential. I run a small business dedicated to encouraging more people to come to Krabi but definitely without losing what makes Krabi so special. It's a balancing act. We are trying to develop more tours and activities in Krabi that will help the area to prosper while at the same time positively discouraging any activity that will in any way spoil the natural beauty. We don't want to compete with Phuket, we don't want the Jet Ski's and banana boats, and we do want to keep the beaches, the coastline and the mountains exactly as nature intended them to be.<br /><br />This article is only concerned with Krabi and Phuket as beach holiday locations in Thailand. My next article will be all about Krabi's inland attractions. And this is where Krabi really can blow Phuket out of the water.<br /><br />So, really, the question of whether Phuket or Krabi are better places for a holiday simply cannot be answered, it really depends on what you are looking for.<br /><br />If you cannot make up your mind, then don't worry, They are less than three hours apart by road. Whichever you choose as a base, we, and many other travel agents in Krabi will arrange trips to Phuket if you are staying in Krabi or trips to Krabi if you are staying in Phuket. So, you can have the best of both worlds.

Due to its great size and extensive area which it covers from North to South and from East to West, a wide variety of climates exist. The climates of Asia can broadly be divided into following types:<br /><br />The Equatorial Climate<br /><br />This climate is found in areas located very close to the equator. The climate is hot and humid all the year round with excessive rainfall. There is no dry season and the rainfall is equally distributed in all months of the year. This type of climate is also called the climate of three eighties  i.e., 80 F ( 27 C ) temperature throughout the year, 80 in (2000 mm) or more total annual rainfall and 80% relative humidity throughout the year. This type of climate is found in Indonesia and Malaysia.<br /><br />The Monsoon Climates<br /><br />This type has a definite dry season and a definite wet season. The cooler season is dry while the hot season is very wet indeed. The best example is the monsoon of the Indian Sub-Continent. Mumbai for example records more than 2000mm (80 inches) of rain in a year but months from December to February are absolutely dry. During the summer season, warm and moist winds blow from the Indian ocean towards India which bring heavy rain. In the cooler months the wind direction is from the land towards the sea so the winds are drier and bring little or no rain. China also experiences this type of climate but the temperatures are cooler than those of Indian monsoon so it is called China type of monsoon.<br /><br />The Desert Climates<br /><br />These type of Climates are found in Central Asia, Saudi Arabia, Iran , North-West India and South-East Pakistan. Although the deserts of Central Asia like Gobi and Taklamakan lie outside the tropics , the excessive heat they face in summer make them similar to the deserts of the lower latitudes. All deserts have the same characteristic features: very low rainfall and extremes of temperature. The rainfall is generally les than 10 inches (250 mm ). The difference between the hottest and coldest month is great . At Luktchun 43 N 90 E in Central Asia mean temperature of the hottest month is 90 F ( 32.2 C ) which rather matches with the tropical deserts but the coldest month records 13 F ( -10.6 C) which is unthinkable in hotter deserts located in Arabia etc.<br /><br />The Middle Latitude Grassland Climates<br /><br />This type of climate is found in the west of Central Asia where Asia meets with Europe at Ural Mountains and on the fringes of Mongolia. I in my opinion, that this webmaster described this amazingly on this <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RoYWlsYW5kbXVheWNhbXAuY29t" target="_blank">wrestling workouts</a>  web page.The summers are warm , the winters cold with moderate rainfall falling mostly in the summer months. The summer temperature generally does not rise above 75 F ( 23 C ) but winters are quite cold with two to three months below 32 F ( 0 C ).<br /><br />The Cold Temperate Climate<br /><br />This type of climate is found at higher latitudes normally above 50 degrees North and have moderate to cool summers and very cold winters. Since these area are very far off from the nearby sea it has got extremes of temperature .The climate is so extreme that such type of extremes are not found anywhere else in the world. Typical example of this type of climate is Verkoyansk in Siberia which is located at 68 degrees North and 133 East . The temperature for the month of July at this station is 60 F ( 16 C ) whereas the temperate for January is -58 F (-50 C ) - a range of 118 F! The precipitation is a moderate 14.7 inches (373 mm) and is mostly in the form of snow.<br /><br />The Artic or Tundra Climate<br /><br />This type of climate occurs in the extreme north of the continent near the North Pole. The climate is extremely cold all the year round and no month is above 43 F ( 6 C ) so no plantation or vegetation can survive. Only Eskimos who have adapted themselves to this sort of harsh climate can survive in this climatic zone. They have special type of houses made of snow locally called igloos to keep them warm.<br /><br />The Mediterranean Climate<br /><br />This type of climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters occur in Turkey, Syria and along the coastal areas of Israel and Lebanon. Istanbul in Turkey is the best example . The hottest month records 74 F ( 23 C ) , the coolest 43 ( 6 C) . Total annual rainfall is 29 in ( 736 mm) of which 20 inches occurs from November to March and the summers are very dry indeed .<br /><br />This in short is a brief detail of different climatic zones found in the continent of Asia.

The world we live in is a contradictory one. There are folks who put on weight rather effortlessly and yearn to lose their weight and fats through unhealthy diets. Yet on the other end of the spectrum, thin people find it tremendously challenging to gain that extra few pounds to enhance their physical appearance and regain some masculine appeal in the case of men. Skinny ladies also dream of fitting nicely into beautiful clothes that look so fabulous on those svelte and voluptuous models. But do not envy those who put on weight too easily, especially those through unhealthy diets. It is better to understand the fundamentals behind healthy weight gain. This is where you can learn more on how to gain weight quickly and healthily.<br /><br />Before we tackle the issue of how to gain weight quickly, let us look at the reasons why scrawny and thin people fail in gaining weight successfully no matter how hard they try. Survey statistics discovered the following as the top reasons why they are not putting on weight:<br /><br />1. Poor Diet<br /><br />Skinny people are not eating right and enough. By that, it means that they are not eating foods that would help them to gain weight. Protein is critical in adding extra weight but many folks do not get enough protein intake. This is where things go awry. I found that this blogger described this incredibly on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5UaGFpbGFuZG11YXljYW1wLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">muay thai gym accommodation</a> weblog.So how can they expect to gain weight quickly or for that matter, any significant weight improvement at all? It is important to load more on protein, and less on simple carbs. Read on for specific weight-gain diet foods.<br /><br />2. Proper Work-out<br /><br />Eating is not sufficient. We all need to engage in some kinds of physical activities to convert our food intake to healthy mass. This conversion can take place only with proper exercises. People who truly understand how to gain weight quickly do so in a healthy manner with proportionate muscle mass gain.<br /><br />3. Poor Motivation<br /><br />Weight gaining or slimming works in a similar manner. Medical practitioners have come to understand that the motivation behind the individual wanting to gain weight is vital to his/her success. Our generation is often called the &quot;instant noodles&quot; generation where everyone desires instant results. Weight gaining is not an overnight mission, but a long-term goal. Failing to understand this is a sure ingredient for weight gain failure.<br /><br />Once we are able to acknowledge and work around the common grounds for failure, we are well on our way to successful quick weight gain. Are you ready for some easy-to-follow tips on how to gain weight quickly?<br /><br />1. Weight Gain Diet Foods 101<br /><br />I mentioned earlier that eating the right foods and eating enough of them is the key to weight gain. Foods such as fast food, chocolates and other junk food like chips won't do you any good. Any weight gain from such foods would do your health more harm than good.<br /><br />Cultivate a habit of eating more than your daily energy and calorie needs. First, find out what is your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) which equates your daily calorie need/count to maintain your weight at its current level. Next, start planning your weekly dietary plans to increase your weekly intake by 3500 calories to achieve a weight gain of 1-2 pounds within a week. This translates to an additional 500 calories in your daily calorie intake.<br /><br />Eat more protein-based food stuff such as beef and chicken. Drink more milk for it is a rich source of protein. Balance your meals with vegetables and nuts as well. Eat 5 or 6 small meals rather than 3 big meals to balance the calorie intake.<br /><br />2. Weight Gain and Muscle Mass Building Routine<br /><br />You need to tone up the extra weight you are adding to your bodies so that you don't end up obese. Depending on your preference for physical activities, the 2 kinds of activities recommended here would be useful in complementing with your weight gain diet.<br /><br />Engage in moderate activities such as brisk walking, jogging or playing a sport for at least 30 minutes for 3-4 times per week. Try to inject some fun into your physical activity so that you would feel encouraged and motivated to cultivate this as a habit and eventually as part of your lifestyle.<br /><br />Work out in the gym on some resistance training for at least 3 times per week. But before you do so, speak to a qualified physical training instructor who can advise on what exercise routine is suitable for you. If not, go to the library to read up on what are the work-out routines that are ideal for a person of your build and weight.<br /><br />Knowing these simple tips on how to gain weight quickly should give you better knowledge than most people in the basic building blocks of gaining weight healthily.
