<br />that I bought you roses 
<br />to tell you that i like you 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I was raised with respect 
<br />not to sleep with you when you were drunk 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That my body's not ripped enough 
<br />to &quot;satisfy&quot; your wants 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />that I open your car door, 
<br />and pull out your chair like I was raised 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I'm not cute enough 
<br />to be &quot;your guy&quot; 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I am actually nice; 
<br />not a jerk 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />I don't have a huge bank account 
<br />to buy you expensive things 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />I like to spend quality nights at home 
<br />cuddling with you, instead of at a club 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />I would rather make love to you then just screw you 
<br />like some random guy. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I am always the one you need to talk to, 
<br />but never good enough to date 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I always held your hair back when you threw up,and didn't get mad at you for puking in my car, 
<br />but when we went out you went home with another guy 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I am there to pick you up at 4am when your new man hit you and dropped you off in the middle of nowhere, 
<br />but not good enough to listen to me when I need a friend 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />If I start not being there because it hurts being used as a door mat, only to be thrown to the side when the new jerk comes around 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />If I don't answer my phone anymore when you call, to listen to you cry for hours, instead of getting a couple hours of sleep before work 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />that you can't realize.. I've been the one all along. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />If you read this and know somebody like this 
<br />but don't care 
<br /><br />But most of all 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />For not being sorry anymore 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That you can't accept me for who I am 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />I can never do anything right, and nothing that I do is good 
<br />enough to make it in your world. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />I caught your boyfriend with another girl and told you about it, I thought that was what friends were for... 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I told you I loved you and actually meant it. 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />That I talked to you for nine hours on Thanksgiving when your boyfriend was threatening you instead of spending time with my family. 
<br /><br />I'm Sorry 
<br />That I cared 
<br /><br />I'm sorry 
<br />that I listen to you at night talking about how you wish you could have done something different. 
<br /><br />Ladies always complain and gripe to their friends that there is never any good guys out there, and they always end up with assholes who mistreat them. Well ladies next time you're complaining, maybe look up to see who you're complaining to, maybe that special someone is right there hanging on your every word as usual, screaming in his head &quot;Why won't you give me a chance?&quot; 
<br />Because the person you are usually searching for is right by you.

<br />To every guy that was never too busy to drive across town to see her. 
<br />To every guy who has given her flowers just because thats how he rolls. 
<br />To every guy that said he would die for her. 
<br />To every guy that really would. 
<br />To every guy that did what she wanted to do. 
<br />To every guy that cried in front of her. 
<br />To every guy that she cried in front of. 
<br />To every guy that holds hands with her. 
<br />To every guy that kisses her with meaning. 
<br />To every guy that hugs her when she's sad. 
<br />To every guy that hugs her for no reason at all. 
<br />To every guy who would give their jacket up for her. 
<br />To every guy that would sit and wait for her for hours just to see her for ten minutes..... 
<br />To every guy that would give his seat up. 
<br />To every guy that just wants to cuddle. 
<br />To every guy that reassured her that she is beautiful no matter what. 
<br />To every guy who told his secrets to her. 
<br />To every guy that tried to show how much he cared through every word and every breath. 
<br />To every guy that believed in her dreams. 
<br />To every guy that would have done anything so she could achieve them. 
<br />To every guy that never laughed at her when she told him her dreams.

<br />To every guy that gave his heart. 
<br />To every guy who hopes that she is happy even if you are not with her. 
<br />To every guy that loves her for who she is and not what she looks like. 
<br />To every guy who has listened and never complained. 
<br />To every guy who has the balls to repost this... 
<br /><br />Not many girls appreciate nice guys anymore. 
<br />And because of this, there are not many left out there. 
<br /><br />I guarantee 90% of the men on your page will not repost this cuz they care more about their image. 
<br /><br />If you are a nice guy repost this with: &quot;Nice guys STILL finish last &quot; 
<br /><br />If you are a girl that thinks every guy should treat a girl this way 
<br />repost this with: &quot;To Every Guy&quot;..

<br />im sorry for ever caring
<br />im sorry for thinkin you were my world
<br />im sorry for dreaming of a future
<br /><br />no matter how longs past, the only thing i dream about his having you back in my arms
<br />today was the worst, seeing your family, all together, once that i was a part off
<br />all through my childhood i dreamed of just meeting that one person,
<br />i did, and it was you!
<br />from the first day i met you, i new there was a future, and you were going to be my world.
<br />i can still now picture all the happy memories, the fun times together
<br />even when i was accepted as part of your family.
<br /><br />i no we've both moved on, but i still cannot forget you, or the life we had.
<br />i no your happy with your new bf now, but i still cant help but picture you and me.
<br />i still dream about the future we planned, even though i no ur happy with someone else loving you.
<br /><br />seeing you today was the hardest ever, your family invting me into your home, and chattin like we used to.
<br />as soon as i walked through that door, all the memories of the past came flooding back to me.
<br />when i looked at you, i just wanted to hold you again, once more in my arms, knowing life was ok.
<br /><br />no matter how many people assure me that life is good, and there plenty more fish in the sea,
<br />i've tried swimming that ocean, and i guess i drowned,
<br />purely because you werent that fish swimming by.
<br /><br />everyone tellls me things happen for a reason, and i should move on, 
<br />but your the only one thats ever made me feel complete, feel love, and feel happiness.
<br /><br />i truly miss you, and until you come back into my arms, i won't be the same again.
<br />you are the one and only
<br />i loved you with all my heart and always will
<br />you are the &quot;one&quot; my life is aimed at
<br /><br />i love you
<br /><br />xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

<br /><br />why is it soo hard to find and talk to decent girls, n spesh if your single even harder to find any future potential????
<br /><br />girls always moan bout guys bein pricks and no nice ones about,
<br />but when you are nice to girls, give them respect and everything else etc,
<br />like calling them beautiful instead of fit, looking at their face instead of pervin at their body
<br />and just generally being nice to them it gets you know where????
<br /><br />maybe bein nice doesnt work, and you have to become one of all the other pricks that are nasty to girls, just see them as sex objects and not be carin n have feelings to actually get anywhere nowadays???
<br /><br />opinions and views please???

<br /><br />swear sometimes this site feels more like a pornsite, n not a site to make friends and chat to peeps?
<br /><br />n on that you can hardly make friends or chat to people unless you fit into a certain group lol!!
<br /><br />like guys will on get comments back or get talked to if they have a six pack or advertise shit on cam, n if u ent any of that and are actually a decent guy yhu jus get ignored!!
<br /><br />n it tha same with girls i guess, they only get loads of comments etc if they got massive boobs or flashing their body off all the time!!
<br /><br />just seem's a shame that normal people cant have a normal conversaation anymore, and pretty much most of the time when you try to have one you just get ignored!!!
<br /><br />views people???

<br /><br />Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink. But if you must lie, lie in the arms of the one you love. If you must steal, steal away from bad company. If you must cheat, cheat death. And if you must drink, drink in the moments that take your breath away. 
<br /><br />Basic Principles - no matter what, no matter when, no matter who... any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom
<br /><br />it happens in the blink of an eye. One moment you're enjoying your life, and the next you're wondering how you ever lived without them. 
<br /><br />You know what it's like getting up every morning? Feeling hopeless, feeling like the love of your life is waking up with the wrong man. But, at the same time hoping that she still finds happiness, even if it's never going to be with you. 
<br /><br />Because that's what people do. They leap, and hope to God they can fly, because otherwise you just drop like a rock, wondering the whole way down, why in the *hell* did I jump? But here I am, falling, and the only one that makes me feel like I can fly... is you.
