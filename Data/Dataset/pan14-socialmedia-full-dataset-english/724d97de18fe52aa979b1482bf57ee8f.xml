There are two common approaches I offer clients that need their brick pavers repaired. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lcGhlbnJ5LmNvbS9wYXZlcnMuYXNweA__" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fephenry.com%2Fpavers.aspx"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://ephenry.com/pavers.aspx</a></a><br /><br />The first approach is Job Cost.  It involve single whole project value. For sake of argument, there may be several pricing options that determines the final total price, but for just about the most part, this may be the full amount the consumer pays soon after the paver repairs are finished. This brick paver repair job cost should cover all labor &amp; materials and mention any possible unforeseen costs that may occur.  During the brick pave repair or retaining wall repair some products will not be reusable. I will list on my paver estimate that I will supply the necessary brick paver replacement receipt for reimbursement. When it comes to the dreaded &quot;unforeseen&quot;, I will cover the cost with my client before I proceed with the paver repairs.  No one will be happy to pay a bill not mentioned in the quote or during the discussions.  Almost 90% of my paver repair projects are covered within the Job Cost quoted. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lcGhlbnJ5LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy5hc3B4" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ephenry.com%2Fproducts.aspx"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ephenry.com/products.aspx</a></a><br /><br />The second one is Hourly Rate approach.  This approach should be preferred only if a brick paver repair client has total trust over the paver contractor.  This approached refers towards open end final cost. I usually spell out that all material costs will be reimbursed and receipts will be supplied.  In this part the client is told that how many hours will be required for brick paver restore.  I normally take a pair of hours for small brick paver repair and almost 5 hours for large paver repair project.  I give the exact hourly rate required to complete the paver fix.  This type of costing the brick paver repair can be risky for both sides so it truly is better to contact shopper daily for explaining the tasks done.  It must be explained to clients that the time required to obtain the material and then unloading it at the site is included in this hourly rate position.  But I don’t include the lunch time and material loading time at the end of the day in this hourly job rate. This approach of costing is the fairest approach to brick paver repairs as long as both parties TRUST each other!<br /><br />Brick paver repair costs is a necessary evil for homeowners to maintain and protect their investment in brick pavers or retaining walls.  Every shopper has to take the crucial decision of accepting the brick paver restore quote.  It is the best thing to choose the best costing option before starting the actual brick paver repair.
