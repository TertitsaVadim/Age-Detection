Every two to 14 minutes the care events take place on medium settings. To determine the average time between demands for the baby, the amount of time between cries should be tracked. The concerned teacher should be asked for a “quiet period” if an upcoming obstacle is known that keeps away from lending the baby. Up to three quiet periods during which these babies sleep and don’t demand care, babies can be programmed.
