<br />During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times.  
<br />I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days.
<br />The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often:
<br />54 times the sheets were clean
<br />17 times it was too late
<br />49 times you were too tired
<br />20 times it was too hot
<br />15 times you pretended to be sleep
<br />22 times you had a headache
<br />17 times you were afraid of waking the baby
<br />16 times you said you were too sore
<br />12 times it was the wrong time of the month
<br />19 times you had to get up early
<br />9 times you said weren't in the mood
<br />7 times you were sunburned
<br />6 times you were watching the late show
<br />5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo
<br />3 times you said the neighbors would hear us
<br />9 times you said your mother would hear us
<br /><br />Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because:
<br /><br />6 times you just lay there
<br />8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling
<br />4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with
<br />7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished
<br />1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move
<br /><br />KEEP READING.......
<br /><br />=====================================================
<br />TO MY DEAR HUSBAND:
<br />I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did:
<br />5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat
<br />36 times you did not come home at all
<br />21 times you didn't cum
<br />33 times you came too soon
<br />19 times you went soft before you got in
<br />38 times you worked too late
<br />10 times you got cramps in your toes
<br />29 times you had to get up early to play golf
<br />2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls  
<br />4 times you got it stuck in your zipper
<br />3 times you had a cold and your nose was running
<br />2 times you had a splinter in your finger
<br />20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day
<br />6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book
<br />98 times you were too busy watching TV
<br />Of the times we did get together:
<br />The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets.
<br />I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, &quot;Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?&quot;
<br />The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe.

<br /><br />The American Government funded a study to see why the head of a man's penis was larger than the shaft.  After 1 year and $180,000, they concluded that the reason that the head was larger than the shaft was to give the man more pleasure during sex.
<br /><br />After the US published the study, the French decided to do their own study. After $250,000 and 3 years of research, they concluded that the reason the head was larger than the shaft was to give the woman more pleasure during sex.
<br /><br />Canadians, unsatisfied with these findings, conducted their own study. After 2 weeks and a cost of around $75.46, and 2 cases of beer, they concluded that it was to keep a man's hand from flying off and hitting himself in the forehead.

<br /><br />DID I MARRY THE RIGHT PERSON?
<br />During one of the seminars, a woman asked a common question.
<br />She said, &quot;How do I know if I married the right person?&quot;
<br />I noticed that there was a large man sitting next to her so I said, &quot;It depends. Is that your husband?&quot;
<br />In all seriousness, she answered &quot;How do you know?&quot;
<br /><br />Let me answer this question because the chances are good that it's weighing on your mind.
<br /><br />Here's the answer.
<br />EVERY relationship has a cycle. In the beginning, you fell in love with your spouse.
<br />You anticipated their call, wanted their touch, and liked their idiosyncrasies.
<br /><br />Falling in love with your spouse wasn't hard.
<br />In fact, it was a completely natural and spontaneous experience. You didn't have to DO anything. That's why it's called &quot;falling&quot; in love...Because it's happening TO YOU.
<br /><br />People in love sometimes say, &quot;I was swept of my feet.&quot; Think about the imagery of that expression. It implies that you were just standing there; doing nothing, and then
<br />something came along and happened TO YOU.
<br /><br />Falling is love is easy. It's a passive and spontaneous experience. But after a few years of marriage, the euphoria of love fades.
<br /><br />It's the natural cycle of EVERY relationship.
<br />Slowly but surely, phone calls become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not always welcome (when it happens), and your spouse's
<br />idiosyncrasies, instead of being cute, drive you
<br />nuts.
<br /><br />The symptoms of this stage vary with every
<br />relationship, but if you think about your marriage, you will notice a dramatic difference between the initial stage when you were in love and a much duller or even angry subsequent stage.
<br /><br />At this point, you and/or your spouse might start asking, &quot;Did I marry the right person?&quot;
<br />And as you and your spouse reflect on the euphoria of the love you once had, you may begin to desire That experience with someone else. This is when marriages breakdown.
<br />People blame their spouse for their unhappiness and look outside their marriage for fulfillment.
<br /><br />Extramarital fulfillment comes in all shapes and
<br />sizes. Infidelity is the most obvious. But sometimes people turn to work, a hobby, a
<br />friendship, excessive TV, or abusive substances.
<br /><br />But the answer to this dilemma does NOT lie outside your marriage. It lies within it. I'm not saying that you couldn't fall in love with
<br />someone else. You could. And TEMPORARILY you'd feel better. But you'd be in the same situation a few years later. Because (listen carefully to this):
<br />THE KEY TO SUCCEEDING IN MARRIAGE IS NOT FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON; IT'S LEARNING TO LOVE THE PERSON YOU FOUND. SUSTAINING love is not a passive or spontaneous experience.
<br /><br />It'll NEVER just happen to you. You can't &quot;find&quot; LASTING love. You have to &quot;make&quot; it day in and day out. That's why we have the expression &quot;the labor of love.&quot; Because it takes time, effort, and energy. And most importantly, it takes WISDOM. You have to know WHAT TO DO to make your marriage work. Make no mistake about it. Love is NOT a mystery.
<br />There are specific things you can do (with or
<br />without your spouse) to succeed with your marriage. Just as there are physical laws of the universe (such as gravity), there are also laws for relationships. Just as the right diet and exercise program makes you physically stronger, certain habits in your relationship WILL make your marriage stronger. It's a direct cause and effect.
<br /><br />If you know and apply the laws, the results are
<br />predictable. ..you can &quot;make&quot; love. Love in marriage is indeed a &quot;decision&quot;.. .Not just a feeling.

<br /><br />ATTORNEY: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: No. 
<br /><br />ATTORNEY: Did you check for blood pressure? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: No. 
<br /><br />ATTORNEY: Did you check for breathing? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: No. 
<br /><br />ATTORNEY: So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: No. 
<br /><br />ATTORNEY: How can you be so sure, Doctor? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar. 
<br /><br />ATTORNEY: But could the patient have still been alive, nevertheless? 
<br /><br />WITNESS: Yes, it is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law.

<br /><br />It is the process of using a microscope to evaluate shape and the properties of individual blood cells.  Using this process, properly trained health professionals have been able to observe some startling nutritional disorders.  These disorders include some conditions that cannot easily be found by using the traditional methods of blood analysis.
<br /><br />By observing various conditions in a sample of blood, the health professional is able to customize a nutritional program specifically geared for the individual needs of the patient.  This method was designed as a screening test to take the guess work out of selecting the appropriate nutritional program for the individual client.
<br /><br />The advantage of the blood microscopy analysis is that many nutritional disorders can be detected before standard blood tests can detect any chemical changes.  Generally then, treatment can be more successful because these problems are discovered when they are still in their infant stages.  This would be considered true preventive care nutrition.
<br /><br />Normal blood is characterized by cells that are approximately the same size and do not stick to each other or clump.  During a blood analysis, your blood is viewed on a television monitor.
<br /><br />Rouleau is one of the most common conditions seen in blood.  The main effect of rouleau causes the red blood cells to stick together.  For optimum function, red blood cells must be separate.  If they stick to each other, their surface area is greatly reduced and the transport of oxygen is drastically impaired.
<br /><br />By using live blood analysis, we are able to see what's going on in the bloodstream and we can make subclinical observations about your nutritional health.
<br /><br />Fortunately, Rouleau and the more than 25 other conditions seen using live blood analysis can often be improved or corrected through supplementation, dietary or lifestyle changes.

<br /><br />A businessman was getting ready to go on a long business trip, so he thought he'd buy his wife something to keep her occupied .  He went to a sex shop &amp; explained his situation.
<br /><br />The man there said, &quot;Well, I don't know that I have anything that will keep her occupied for so many weeks, except...  The Voodoo Penis!&quot;
<br /><br />The husband said &quot;The what&quot;?  The man repeated &quot; 
<br />The Voodoo Penis&quot; and pulled out what seemed to be an ordinary dildo.  The husband laughed, and said, &quot;It looks like a dildo!&quot;
<br /><br />The man then pointed to the door and said, &quot;Voodoo Penis, door!&quot;
<br />The penis rose out of its box, darted over to the door and started pounding the keyhole.  The whole door shook wildly with vibrations, so much that a crack began to form down the middle.  Then the man said &quot;Voodoo Penis, return to box!&quot; and the penis stopped &amp; returned to the box. 
<br /><br />The husband bought it.  He took it home to his wife, And after the husband had been gone a few days, the wife remembered the Voodoo Penis.  She undressed, opened the box and said &quot;Voodoo Penis, my crotch&quot;.  The penis shot to her crotch.  It was absolutely incredible.  After three mind shattering  orgasms, she became very exhausted and decided she'd had enough.  She tried to pull it out, but it was stuck.  Her husband had neglected to tell her how to turn it off.  So she put her clothes on, got in her car and started for the hospital.
<br /><br />On the way, another incredibly intense orgasm made her swerve over the road.  A police officer saw this and immediately pulled her  over. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink.  Gasping and twitching, the woman said &quot;I haven't had anything to drink officer.
<br />You see, I've got this Voodoo Penis thing stuck in my crotch and it won't stop screwing me...&quot;
<br /><br />The officer looked at her for a second, shook his head and replied, 
<br />&quot;Yeah right... Voodoo Penis, my ass...!&quot;
<br /><br />The rest, as they say, is history....

<br /><br />From cheapest to most expensive how you can save money on petrol:
<br /><br />1. Put air in your tires to your car specifications, eighty percent of the tires on cars are low on air and that costs you 1 to (ready for this) 5 miles per gallon!
<br /><br />2. Go lightly on the gas pedal = save gas. That means slow down.  The faster you go, the more air drag you create. This burns that expensive petrol! That 55 mph may drive you nuts, but it saves gas.
<br /><br />3. Try not to stop... to save petrol!  Huh, you say?  Here it is, slow down and look for space in traffic so that you can time the stop lights...  so you don’t have to stop at them.  Make it a game!  Getting all that steel around you moving, costs the big bucks in petrol! If you have to stop, start out gently – jack rabbit starts bust the petrol budget!
<br /><br />4. Take the junk out of your trunk! Every 200 lbs in your car costs you a mile per gallon of petrol. If you are in a car pool have every one that rides in your car go on a diet, to save gasoline.
<br /><br />5. Use your cruise control (if you have it) any time you can. Cruise control is better than your brain to help you maintain constant speed.  Constant speed (see #3), at a conservative rate, will save you more petrol.
<br /><br />6. Don’t use the drive through at McDonald’s!  Save petrol!  Quickly park your car and walk inside, not only does that save petrol, but helps your heart!   Stop driving around to look for the closest parking place at Walmart, park quickly and walk fast!
<br /><br />7. This one is more for men. If you get lost ask for directions. I don’t, and I waste petrol driving around because I know I will find where I am. Women ask directions, that’s why there’s one on every space shuttle. It improves space shuttle fuel mileage!
<br /><br />8. Sell your neighbors on MLM so they can work at home like you do. You? Avoid traffic jams by never leaving the driveway during rush hour.  If you should accidentally get caught in a traffic jam, turn off your car to save petrol...   Make sure you have a good battery before you do it too often.
<br /><br />9. When you get an oil change, use synthetic oil. The petrol savings will pay for the oil or a little more, and it will dramatically reduce your engine wear = save money!
<br /><br />10. Don’t want to get an engine tune up to save petrol? At least check the air filter for the engine!  Usually air filters get dirty before you need a tune up and this costs you petrol.
<br /><br />11. No, don’t rush out and buy a hybrid electric car. The cost of operation isn’t worth the petrol savings and those big batteries make them a lead sled! Wait a few years!

<br /><br />When u see the rich gets richer....
<br /><br />When more people care about themselves....
<br /><br />When average people struggle to make ends meet....
<br /><br />When well-off individuals get more government projects....
<br /><br />When basic necessities become more expensive to the majority....
<br />.....and you are restricted to voice your opinion freely, as you have got no permit....
<br /><br />When there's a constant increase in unemployment/VSS....
<br /><br />When business people think about cost, and employ imported workforce....
<br /><br />When graduates works in industries not relevant to their qualifications....
<br />....or even worse, fail to find employment
<br /><br />What I personally think is not important, but what do YOU think?
<br /><br />Please don't think this is POLITICAL....it is NOT....this is our life, and it affects your kids too....
<br /><br />This is reality, it is directly affecting each one of us and we need to do something about it....and what are we doing about it.....or you don't care?
<br /><br />LET'S BE MORE HUMANE &amp; EXPECT A BETTER 2008 onwards.....
<br /><br />I LOVE MY COUNTRY &amp; FELLOW MALAYSIANS....
<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR READING..... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Public Rallies are considered nuisance to the Malaysian public
<br /><br />The NORMAL REACTION
<br />Government/Police will not issue PERMITS to any form of public gatherings
<br /><br />The PROPOSAL
<br />Issue permits (hence, allow democracy to exist) to only &quot;controlable&quot; (if there's such a word) rallies, i.e. gatherings in small numbers
<br /><br />For EXAMPLE
<br />If the government feels that they can control a group of 100 people, then allow these 100 people to do a gathering (i.e. send memo to king, billion RM claim to the british government, etc). If these 100 people become violent, then the government can easily control them, hence NO big hu-ha, or &quot;kacau-bilau&quot;, or nuisance, or destructions to public properties
<br /><br />The RESULT
<br />MALAYSIA CAN STILL BE &quot;SEEN&quot; AS A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY
<br /><br />Can, Pak Lah?
<br /><br />Note: Only one of your rakyat humble opinion.....TQ
