Do I think she is a bad person because of the things she has done? No! Miley Cyrus is a teenager. At the age of 16, I did plenty of things that I'm not proud of today. I learned from those mistakes and moved on. The life Miley has chosen doesn't allow her to just learn from a mistake and forget about it. Every wrong move she has ever made is rehashed over and over again.
