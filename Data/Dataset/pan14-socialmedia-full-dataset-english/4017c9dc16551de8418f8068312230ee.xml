<br /><br />Research shows that the world is less than 25% are obese, and the day will be increased. The weight caused by diseases such as coronary artery disease. Cerebral thrombosis, diabetes, high blood pressure. Diseases of the respiratory system. Alzheimer's disease. Gastrointestinal disease, hernia, gallbladder stones, gout, some cancers such as breast, colon, prostate, uterus cancer.
<br /><br />It is estimated that each year the amount of the therapeutic outcome of obesity has nearly 2,000 salons at least one million per year. The joke is that the Thais do, and if he's a lot more weight will help reduce costs, this amounts to not less.
<br /><br />Faculty of Science Talked about. To <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">lose weight safely</a> and effectively. In fact, close to remark that it is no less interesting. The definition of obesity that.
<br /><br />Obesity is a disease with body fat than normal. Have accumulated more than the energy used. In addition, the distribution of body fat is also important to have a bad effect on health. Or simply get to know the weight or not. I then lowered her head to look. If you do not see your toes. This is called fat. Fat is to have more body fat than normal. I have a lot of muscle, which is considered obese.
<br /><br />But the correct solution should be used to calculate body mass index is more accurate. So if you want to know that they are obese or not. BMI is calculated as follows.
<br /><br />Body mass index.
<br /><br />body mass index (BMI) = weight (kg) / height 2 (m 2).
<br />Based on body mass index (kg / m 2) the risk of illness.
<br />Weighing less than standard.
<br />Weight standards.
<br />Overweight.
<br />Risk of obesity.
<br />Obesity is the first step.
<br />Obesity Step 2.
<br />= 23.
<br />23.0 - 24.925.0 - 29.9&gt; = 30.
<br />Low (but risk of other complications).
<br />Normal
<br />More than usual.
<br />Moderate growth.
<br />Greatly increased.
<br />IOTF: Asia Pacific.
<br /><br />This index is calculated as if it were up to standard. Let's take it to another level where you are overweight. The interesting issue is that
<br /><br />Obese people often have the true risk of death than body fat. The worrisome high-risk men than women because men are big fat ratio. But most women under belly is bloated abdomen, thighs, groin, and thus the ratio of obese people have died over the body. Because abdominal fat is more dangerous. Since the release of fat into the bloodstream and clogging the arteries of the fat from the abdomen over These fats make insulin work less efficiently. Diabetes have increased.
<br /><br />Lose weight properly.
<br /><br />Universal known. However, most do not have. It may be a factor that the firm is still committed to making it difficult to target. How to lose weight is to be included.
<br /><br />• diet.
<br />• exercise.
<br />• Changes in behavior.
<br />• Consult a doctor.
<br /><br />The key to losing weight, you will need before the first three ways, so it is very important to make you lose weight to be true. The other things you can not change behavior. It will make the weight. And exercise. Makes it easier.
<br /><br />Weight loss goals should be.
<br /><br />Rgaitaggrgai time most people are impatient to lose weight very quickly, but to reduce the accumulation of fat takes years. The main scientific goals of weight loss is most appropriate. Should reduce the weight down slowly and only 5-10% of initial body weight is sufficient to reduce the risk of various diseases. That come with obesity. Decreased 0.5 kg per week, is the best. And in my mind that you should keep in mind. As long as reduction is more like 1-2 kg / week. Weight rebound is even faster than before, and the yo-yo, in which people lose weight quickly. It will greatly increase the risk of heart disease by up to 10%.
<br /><br />Most people just like drugs and external factors by themselves do not fix it. If weight loss is the right way and wrong way. But it's not ready to do it yourself. Weight down and back up over the same period a year almost 100%, so it was a way to lose weight and reduce the need to control. Weight loss of only 5-10% would reduce the risk of various diseases. Down clearly.
<br /><br />The eating behavior is not difficult.
<br /><br />In weight loss diet is most needed. Whether or not drug use. If you control the food. Will cause more harm than good. It is debilitating. So you should eat a small portion, but the other 20% is misleading. Not that the dinner is not fat. In fact, while you sleep, many parts of the body continues to consume the heart, lungs, and which are to be used.
<br /><br />Also, how many times a day, eating meals, but only about a few things. Is better than eating a meal at the meal, but a lot. The easiest way is to return to nature. Choose foods like brown rice, whole grains, minimally processed fruits and vegetables or eat more local, seasonal, and the best because it is fresh. Value of the nutrients are still available. Better to eat a pickled or preserved.
<br /><br />Also, eat food on time will cause the body to balance and work more effectively with Every time we eat sugar regulating hormone insulin is released. If you do not eat on time when the hormone is probably why I feel like shaking hands, eat dessert first. The more fat you eat dessert, and more. So the best time to eat.
<br /><br />One technique that I want them to eat slowly, chew slowly, it is not overlooked. It will eat less. When the plate into his mouth, chewing thoroughly, at least chew it 15 times, but I do chew the year 32 times better then swallowing it, you will notice that people who chewed up and eaten up most of the volume and weight.
<br /><br />Exercise enough.
<br /><br />It is known that most people do not like to exercise. The default behavior for weight loss, it is necessary to use more energy. The transition from the elevator to go up the stairs. Went wrong, and more. With vigor and enthusiasm to move more slowly and then to exercise regularly
<br /><br />Research indicates that <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">Exercise</a> to reduce weight. I exercise 45 minutes a day, every day, you will be able to reduce the weight to be exact. But most people do not. Meet me halfway, it is still a week to exercise at least every other day. The river is 20-30 at a time and then you will lose weight to help your muscles strong, fit body shape. And good long-term weight control. The exercises help you reduce stress.
<br /><br />The psychological effects of obesity, I see many stressful time. The more I eat. Because I think some people eat. This would suggest that meditation can help you out.
<br /><br />Do not expect to be super skinny. It is fat that has accumulated since it was not quite get fatter. And to reduce by 50% or half the original weight, it is not, of course, well enough, but only 5-10% in a year if you happen to have increased by 5-10 kg, and I highly recommend it. doctor. It's normal to have increased by only 1-2 kg. That may have health problems such as certain diseases. Or certain drugs that cause obesity. This must be corrected by the doctor.
<br /><br />Tips for weight loss.
<br /><br />• Write down what you eat in one day. To always remind myself. And evaluation of every day. This will allow you to develop your own weight loss and better.
<br /><br />• If I have 60 bottles of soft drinks to lose weight is 1 kg.
<br /><br />• 10 bottles of beer may reduce the weight to be 1 kg (1 cc of alcohol is 7 calories a beer bottle to 800 kilo calories of energy).
<br /><br />• Vegetable oils and animal oils. Unlike the low cholesterol vegetable oil. , Respectively. Both are fat. So, it's not fat either.
<br /><br />• If I take pills. Under the supervision of a physician is!
<br /><br />Finally I remark that for everyone who wants to lose weight that's right.
<br /><br />You do not need to weigh it. Weighing all these strictly prohibited. Because weight loss is not really. Is reduced to about 0.5 kg / week only. If you weigh every day, it would be discouraging. It did not want to lose. Should be weighed once a week is enough to see the changes. Continue to be encouraged.

The incident with the image sensor. (This is the most widely used CCD) camera to focus before pressing the shutter and exposure. The set itself. To achieve the desired results. But with the digital tuning function or feature. Many like never before. In a film camera. We need to learn more and understand better. We will use digital cameras to cost-effectively. And benefits.
<br /><br />1. Turn off all unused digital camera with an electronic system. All controlled by computer. Consumes more battery. Should be switched off each time after use. It allows you to shoot more. Without having to change batteries frequently if the function Auto off timer automatically when not in use for 30 or 60 seconds.
<br /><br />2. The battery better. Many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">digital cameras</a> use AA alkaline batteries were supplied with 2 or 4, but you may be shocked when the new battery. Press the camera shutter to 20-30 by the image of the monitor. Flash and the battery is already exhausted. It is recommended to change the battery. Nickel - Metal Hi-Drive (NiMH) battery, which adds to cost 100-150 baht for the first time from 1000 to 1500 mAh power to shoot up. If it's rechargeable. I bought the set 2-3, but the camera is supplied NiMH or Li-ion batteries to go. I may buy another one for emergencies.
<br /><br />3. See the optical viewfinder. SLR or compact camera, the film will look out of the box. The camera was there as well. The optical viewfinder. Designed to be relevant. The focal length. Lens zoom range. And it looks like the back of LCD monitors with. The popular image of the monitor, but the battery will run out very quickly this way. Should be used only as necessary. Macro shooting distance. This will provide a more accurate picture of reality. If I shoot long distances up to 5 meters from the viewfinder. Optical representation.
<br /><br />4. Switch to a high capacity card. There are many types of storage cards including CF, Microdrive, SmartMedia, Memory Stick, SD, MMD has such high capacity. And the reduced capacity of the CF 128 MB can be purchased for only 3,000 to 4,000 baht (two years before the price. 17,000 to 20,000 baht), currently available in size 512 MB CF card, then early next year will be 1000 MB or 1GB card, according to one brand or Microdrive (CF card used in some brands), capacity 340, 500 and 1000MB is interesting because of the size and capacity. Be underestimated. It is a hard card. Must be careful not to drop it. On high-capacity cards. It will shoot up. At times, when not sure about the lighting conditions. The bracketing. I have a picture, then choose the best image later.
<br /><br />5. Do not switch the card while the camera. To minimize the damage that may occur. Do not switch the card while the camera is turned on. The card should be with caution. Insert it into the straight. Specified in the manual. If you do not have the will. It is strictly forbidden to play. If you lend it to others to be explained to understand all.
<br /><br />6. Use an external flash. Some cameras can use an external flash. By plugging into the hot shoe. Or sync. This makes it even better picture and use it for more than a small flash on your camera flash light with high external The aperture is narrow, resulting in images with greater depth and with the camera's battery. I do not have to use the built-in flash.
<br /><br />7. Lock the main image. Some cameras have a function to lock the image. Prevent accidental deletion. We mainly focus on the negative image it is easy. For the next shot. Like the delete key away. So after shooting the picture with it. Should press the lock button on every picture.
<br /><br />8. Store with a CD-ROM. After shooting the card is full. We are transferring all the pictures. To a computer. This will add more and more. Even if your hard drive is a good joke. If the problem is. I'm taking all the pictures you will be lost immediately. Safety. Should record a CD - ROM, which has a capacity of 650-700 MB per sheet for 20 to 30 should only choose a CD. Quality, such as Sony or Kodak Fujifilm that robust storage for decades. The decline in CD burner for about 4,000 baht and not a CD or two. Maintained without the use of one sheet. Sheet for use in general, if a CD is damaged or lost, I still have the original disc. Bring copies to the other.
<br /><br />9. Zoom enlarges the image contrast. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">Digital functions</a> that I use frequently. After shooting it. Press the Zoom button to view. The zoom and scroll through as many different parts. The picture is clear enough. Sometimes a picture with the zoom level. Then open the aperture. Depth is thin. The contrast. There are only a few. If a film camera. I have to wait for the film to know that the image contrast is very much in the picture. With a slow shutter speed. Not sure. The image is sharp enough. Can zoom the image to see it as well.
<br /><br />10. Adjust the brightness of the monitor. If you shoot with your camera to fit the image being displayed on the monitor. Too dark or under. Do not blame the metering system to load the image into the computer. Then open the view. I suggest using a software program supplied with the video camera. If it is found that the image brightness, the monitor is too dark. To increase the brightness until the menu appears on screen.
<br /><br />11. Using a heat chart rectification. Most digital cameras now have a function. Heat a big chart on the monitor program. Keeping in mind that once. Taken to be a much better tone. If that is the shadow (dark tones) and the highlights (bright tone) is not good enough to adjust the tone or contrast of the function menu. The new camera has the best tone. Although it is possible to modify the tone of the user application software such as Adobe Photoshop images that capture the tone, but without the need to tweak or adjust a little. It provides a better picture. The details are complete. From the brightest. In the darkest images.
<br /><br />12. A RAW or TIFF formats in digital format are available in two images is the JPEG image compression with smaller file sizes. To save space in the store. The downside is that lower quality. Gradation is not good enough. The show is only 24 bits are the highest quality image. Should select a RAW or TIFF formats are not compressed. The card stores the images in high-capacity storage. And decrease, respectively. In the future, may not be used in JPEG format anymore and the RAW format still images can be displayed in color, 12 bits or 36 bits per color (RG<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> color gradation is excellent. Images that look natural. As with the film.

However, research has suggested that about 20% successful in reducing and controlling weight. When the target 10% of body weight within a year.
<br /><br />This is what is being said. The importance of the target as if you weigh 80 kilograms, you should aim to 8 kg within the first year that this research report. The weight 33 kg within a period of five years and in weight control is a constant. Need to increase physical activity. And more. Control calories. And foods that contain fat. Do not eat breakfast. Although most tend to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">lose weight</a> without success. But we also know that some people lose weight successfully. Research in 1994, with a population of 4,000 people aged 18 years and weight 13.6 kg minimum. And weight control has been achieved. The survey questionnaire that &quot;What is the secret&quot;.
<br /><br />Of the half had been overweight since childhood and nearly 75% had a parent or two people (see my mother or father is fat. You have to thin it) respondents, average weight 33 kg (minimum 6.13 kg) has a period of at least 6 years and 13% of the weight for a period of 10 years and 55.4% of People who lose weight successfully. Others support it, such as physicians, nutrition or weight loss program, the remaining 44.6% can lose weight with 89% used both to control calories and exercise, only 10% is achieved only diet alone, and only 1% of the weight just exercise alone.
<br /><br />So to lose weight. You need to control the calories that enter the body. And to exercise more. A certain way. Often does not work.
<br /><br />Strategies to control calories. (Respondents tend to use more than one method), fasting on one of them (87.6%), such as fasting, the fat may Dessert limit (44%) of calories (43%) using supplements (20%. ) (noting the need to lose weight by not eating food), the amount of fat (25%) the type of food (22%), such as switching from whole milk. The skim milk to reduce fat. The change from ice cream to yogurt.
<br /><br />Most (almost all) to control the calories. And the amount of fat. And exercise. Most will eat an average of 1380 - 1800 kilo calories per day by 78% eat breakfast every day with only 4% who did not eat breakfast.
<br /><br />Breakfast is the most fruit. Fiber cereals. And eating out an average 2.5 meals per week. (The problem of food outside the home or restaurant. We can not control the type and amount of food it is), most of the work. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">Body and burn calories</a> to 2,545 kilo calories per week. The average man is 3,293 kilo calories per week. Most often, the heavy, moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling 76% 20% 20% weight to relieve stress is an important part as well. Because stress and depression gave way to more food.
<br /><br />Weight regain, the weight usually returns. Some of the first year, but if you can lose weight steadily at 2-5 years, the weight will come back down the other half. And after five years to regain the weight they are, the less the other half.
<br /><br />How to lose weight is not difficult at all. If we are in earnest. I would ask people who are trying to lose weight. I do not see it.

Each camp is trying to develop its own technology and a Function is that after a lot of attention is a Video.
<br /><br />Currently in the entertainment industry. I have to use an <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">SLR camera</a> filming the widely advertised, or even a movie theater. For reasons that have good quality. But the cost is not high. I will take my camera with a lens that you would look too plain and simple, it requires a device used to do in particular. Today we will talk about these devices together.
<br /><br />1. Tripod. A device for both stills and movies. Video taken in the case of a pan head that can adjust the viscosity of the turn. To provide a constant speed in panning to see a better option. It is also very necessary. If used in conjunction with accessories.
<br /><br />2. SLR Video Rig.Many people may not know that I was a SLR Rig accessories designed for popular SLR camera to shoot video with a variety of devices. I have the same kind of style, this will be the main devices.
<br /><br />Rod is a cylindrical steel rod. Has served as an undrafted. It is the backbone for the additional equipment.
<br /><br />Plate base for the camera. Adjacent to the derailed earlier.
<br /><br />Follow Focus is a device for turning the focus is in the making. The camera may not play with the DOF on the image to see more interesting. It will rotate the lens to direct it to be difficult.
<br /><br />Cage, Hand Grip and Shoulder Pad because sometimes we do not want a static image. Based on stand alone. If you want to move the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">camera</a> as a model. I have to stick with the accessories. Accessories are the answer here.
<br /><br />Matte Box, many people have seen on the main page. Is put into the shade the lens to cause noise Galapagos mail or fax it. The slots for the various filters. Or even put on the scale the image that is proportional to the conversion. The left picture is me.
<br /><br />3. Monitor LCD screen because the camera is small, about 3 inches behind the images we see are not very detailed. May be made to the details. Monitor is another important piece of equipment that allows us to solve or a repair again saving you a lot of time and resources.
<br /><br />4. Equipment. Although the camera will record about it. The sound quality is not great, it looks and sounds. I use the mic to record sound, it makes a better choice than Mike will have to choose either to go out with the camera and sound into video files that have. Or a separate recorder and then I have to put the sound files, video again. The way to use it is up to the skill and style of work.
<br /><br />5. Device is equipped Stabilizer reduces camera shake when we need movement. This will make the eyes look smooth and headache.
<br /><br />By now, it's recommended accessories in a Video at the chance to come to 
<br />them to introduce the use of each device.

		<document id="8797e730f1f2ac18313170ec3545116" url=""><![CDATA[7 Tips To Better Photos.<br/><br/>After I bought my first digital camera, complete with its little viewing screen, people would usually ask, “Can I see the picture?” Children would ask me to take their picture, and then run over and ask to see it, then run back and ask me to take another!
<br /><br />It’s great to have all that excitement, but were my pictures actually the best they could be?
<br /><br />Here are 7 tips that I have learned that have improved the quality of my photos.
<br /><br />1. Always use the highest resolution setting. At the start, I had the resolution set to medium. That way I was able to take about 100 pictures before having to download the memory card to my computer’s hard disk. That was fine for viewing on screen, but then one day I wanted to do an 8x10 paper version, and the results were disappointing. Now I always use the highest resolution my cameras can provide. I have had to spend some money on more memory cards, but it was worth it.
<br /><br />2. Use a Tripod. Even the slightest movement of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">camera</a> can create a blurry image. Invest in a tripod. I have also found that when taking group shots, I am better able to judge when to “click” if I am looking directly at the group, rather than through the view finder.
<br /><br />3. Buy a Good Photo-Editing Program. Perhaps your camera came with Photoshop Elements, or similar. If not, go to your computer retailer and buy one. Not only can you fix blemishes (maybe Susan was having a bad zit day), but you can do more creative things as well. Recently I combined a photo of my grand-daughter with one of Dora-the-Explorer. Jasmine loved it.
<br /><br />4. Use the Lowest Compression Setting. As you use that fancy <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photo</a> editing program, be careful of your compression setting. Most programs default to “jpeg” format, which saves space by selectively removing pixels, and recreating them the next time you view the photo. If you open, edit, and save a photo multiple times, the over-all quality decreases. Try to do all your editing in one pass, using the lowest compression, or use a format like “tiff”, which does not compress.
<br /><br />5. Get in Close. Don’t waste pixels on excess background. Get in closer, either physically or with an optical zoom setting.
<br /><br />6. Good Things Come in Threes (or more!). Considering the incremental costs of taking a photo with a digital camera (close to nil!), you should take lots of shots. If the shot is available for more than a few seconds, take more that one exposure. I always tell the subjects of my photos that I will be taking at least 2 or 3 shots of them. A blink at the wrong time ruins the potential.
<br /><br />7. Read the Manual. In fact, read it more than once. As if I have to explain this one!
<br /><br />Here’s an equation for you.
<br /><br />(LOTS of photos with your digital camera) + (the above tips) = (a day coming soon when you’ll be proud to show off your creations)

<br /><br />Cholesterol was not a factor when Charles Darwin's proposed his theory &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;. He would certainly re-write his theory if he existed today, battling with the cause himself. Survive - we do: fittest -? that needs speculation, with half of the world population battling with a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">cholesterol</a> condition.
<br /><br />Our ancestors had lived most of their life feeding on fruits, grasses, herbs, nuts, leaves, roots, water , seeds, cereals and hunting meat which was often a daunting task without the four wheel drives and buffalo shotguns.
<br /><br />Today, surviving, unlike our ancestors is not fighting with tigers, running after antelopes, or working the ground for roots. It is often fighting with ourselves that makes us weak. Of the fierce predators is the commonplace cholesterol which we find in abundance. Cookies, cakes, colas, chemicals, pesticides, chocolate, cool drinks, preservatives and the list could go on for a few hundred pages.
<br /><br />Some people develop dangerous tumors. Other people have Cholesterol levels that are through the roof. For you, your diet and lifestyle is causing the condition commonly referred to as Cholesterol.
<br /><br />This condition is simply a SYMPTOM of a very fundamental and dangerous imbalance within your body, and Cholesterol is simply the initial way it is manifesting itself in your body.
<br /><br />The biggest influence on blood cholesterol level is the mix of fats in the diet
<br /><br />The most important determinant for cholesterol in the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">body</a> is fat from diet. Though our liver produces 75% of cholesterol only 25% is absorbed from the food. For a high cholesterol condition, fats are of different types. Some fats are good for cholesterol levels while others are obviously bad. What are becoming clearer and clearer is those bad fats, meaning saturated and Tran's fats increase the risk for certain diseases while good fats, meaning monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, lower the risk. The key is to substitute good fats for bad fats.
<br /><br />Your Body - a Breeding Ground
<br /><br />Extensive research reveals that, proliferation of cholesterol in society is a direct manifestation of our changed lifestyles. When people around the world experience similar problems, it's not a random incident but a methodical process spreading across cultures and borders.
<br /><br />The body is infected by acids: released from sugars, carbohydrates, excess fat and uric acid, found a plenty in modern day foods.
<br /><br />Robert A. Young a leading micro-biologist, author of &quot;The ph miracle&quot; quotes: &quot;There is only One Sickness and One Disease, and this one 'sickness' is the over-acidification of the body due primarily to an inverted way of living, thinking, and eating... there can therefore be only one remedy and treatment, and that is to alkalize the body and break the cycle of imbalance, thus allowing us to experience the energy, vitality and true health we're all meant to have.&quot;
<br /><br />Cholesterol Reduction: Recommendations for Fat Intake
<br /><br />Although the different types of fat have a varied - and admittedly confusing - effect on health and disease, the basic message is simple: chuck out the bad fats and replace them with good fats.
<br /><br />Focus on the ROOT CAUSE that is causing your Cholesterol... choose fruits and vegetables that drive the acids out of your body, burn of the excess by maintaining a strict schedule of work-outs. The many drugs available promising to reduce your cholesterol are optimistic placebo which works well when you are distressed.
<br /><br />Instead of &quot;Medication&quot; and &quot;fighting the symptoms&quot;, you start thinking about &quot;Health&quot; and treating the cause with THE RIGHT DIET

		<document id="776e44edd6d1abd6edaf11a2f2620734" url=""><![CDATA[How To Better Photography.<br/><br/>Taking a skilled photo isn't as tricky as you could think. You don't need the generally 
<br /><br />expensive camera or years of experience, solely 10 unadorned tips.
<br /><br />Good!
<br /><br />Tip 1 - Use All Your Available Space
<br /><br />Don't be scared to aid all the interval in your photo. If you aspire to take a picture of 
<br /><br />something, it's ok pro it to take up the total shot with thumbs down or very little background 
<br /><br />screening. Keep distractions made known of your shot
<br /><br />Tip 2 - Study Forms
<br /><br />This is a essential aspect to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photography</a>. Understanding forms in your photos. Don't think it 
<br /><br />over an object, she its affect and its form and discover the preeminent slant to photograph it 
<br /><br />from. Form is all around us and I highly recommend you read as many books on it as doable.
<br /><br />Tip 3 - Motion inside Your Photos
<br /><br />Never be inflicted with shift in your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photos</a> if you are photographing a still object. If here 
<br /><br />is something tender while you are tiresome to photograph a stationery object, your photo won't 
<br /><br />curve made known anywhere virtually as well. Also by no means deposit a horizon line in the 
<br /><br />focal point of your frame. 
<br /><br />Tip 4 - Learn To Use Contrasts Between Colors.
<br /><br />Some of the preeminent photos be inflicted with shades of white, bleak and black. You can take 
<br /><br />splendid shots with solely lone color on your theme, but the contrasts linking insignia in a 
<br /><br />shot is could you repeat that? Makes you a splendid photographer. 
<br /><br />Tip 5 - Get Closer To Your Subject
<br /><br />This is lone of the biggest mistakes generally photographers get on to, not getting close 
<br /><br />sufficient to their theme. Get up and private and close the distance gap. You can permanently 
<br /><br />reshape and resize a skilled shot but you can't take up again to enlarge a distant object.
<br /><br />Tip 6 - Shutter Lag
<br /><br />Shooting proceedings shots with digital camera's can be tricky due to close lags. What this 
<br /><br />earnings is, as you press the button to take the photo, it can take up to a following pro the 
<br /><br />close to take a photo, by with the intention of calculate could you repeat that? You were 
<br /><br />photographing would be inflicted with stirred or altered in some way.  This earnings you be 
<br /><br />inflicted with to compensate pro close lag by predicting could you repeat that? Your theme is 
<br /><br />vacant to sort out and taking the photo solely previous to it takes the proceedings you aspire. 
<br /><br />Other expensive digital cameras don't be inflicted with this conundrum.
<br /><br />Tip 7 - Pan 
<br /><br />If you are taking an proceedingsdings shot and your close alacrity is gradual, pan with the 
<br /><br />object. Follow through with the theme, from start to close and lone of persons shots will be a 
<br /><br />winner. You be inflicted with more opportunity of getting a skilled shot if you take more at 
<br /><br />that time lone photo.
<br /><br />Tip 8 - Continuous Shots
<br /><br />To pan like I suggested higher than you will need a camera with the intention of does 
<br /><br />unremitting shots and doesn't need to bring to a standstill and process with each shot. 
<br /><br />Tip 9 - How To Take Fantastic Night Time Shots
<br /><br />Night calculate shots can be spectacular, almost magical.... If made aptly! If not they can 
<br /><br />look horrible. Really horrible. Without passable lighting, even skilled camera's can curve made 
<br /><br />known crappy photos if the photographer doesn't know could you repeat that? He or she is 
<br /><br />responsibility. 
<br /><br />Tip 10 - Study Your Manual 
<br /><br />If your digital camera has a special night calculate mode, read the blue-collar and stay on 
<br /><br />their directions on how to aid it by the book.

		<document id="9468f87179713de7c1f68c145a460046" url=""><![CDATA[Digital Or Film Photography<br/><br/>The popularity of digital cameras may have enjoyed amazing increase but film has still an important part to play in photography and will continue to be important for some time, a few years at the least. Film has many advantages that photographers continue to recognize. Major players in the production of film like Kodak is still putting into it millions though experts all agree that digital film will reign supreme in the near future.
<br /><br />These are the reasons though why some photographers prefer film over digital:
<br /><br />1)Facilities and Investment
<br /><br />Ordinary people, not only photographers, have invested considerably in photographic equipments that use film. Cameras and lenses still have capabilities that digital <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">photography</a> cannot match. Compared with a high-end professional 35mm camera, a digital camera still lacks facilities that only the traditional camera can provide. A photographer who decides to switch to digital may find himself spending big especially if his lenses, flashes and other accessories are not compatible with a new digital system.
<br /><br />2)Wide Angle
<br /><br />The absence of extreme wide-angle lenses and a slow start-up time are two of the most disadvantages of even the best digital cameras. 35mm cameras modifies to digital bodies usually employ a CCD image sensor that is smaller, usually around 245mm x 16mm) as opposed to the 36mm x 24mm x 35mm film that results to a narrow angle. Photographers who are fans of wide angles may find the traditional 35mm more of their liking.
<br /><br />3)Action
<br /><br />Film cameras also offer an advantage during fast-changing and unpredictable photography scenarios. Unlike digital camera that uses batteries than can ran out in the most unexpected time, a 35mm camera can be easily switched on and ready for use whenever you need take a shot. Moreover, digital cameras usually take several seconds before you can use it which obviously is a disadvantage for photographers who wants to capture actions which can’t be repeated anymore.
<br /><br />4)Tough Conditions
<br /><br />Film cameras are also sturdier equipments than their <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">digital</a> counterparts and can withstand harsh conditions that photography may demand in the line of work. Count on film to be more reliable than digital especially when your are working in a not-so-good weather conditions.
<br /><br />5)Comparing Costs
<br /><br />When it comes to cost, film and digital advantages and disadvantages vary considerably depending on the usage. A photographer with a film budget amounting to thousands of dollars in one year may find digital camera more practical. But if you are not a busy photographer, your income may not defray the cost of going digital.

<br /><br />This article will tell you but my approach is a little different. I am not going to tell you the best fat burner by discussing certain ingredients or chemicals or telling you some particular brand name is the greatest.
<br /><br />No. I am going to let the average person decide by casting a vote. I used an internet tool that let me determine how many searches were performed for a particular word or phrase at a certain search engine.
<br /><br />The results were for the month of May, 2006. I selected well known <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">weight loss</a> pills, brand names or an ingredient and then entered that word or phrase to get my numerical result.
<br /><br />The top vote getter, the most searched term for an herbal diet pill or what the people think is the best fat burner is &quot;ephedra&quot;.
<br /><br />Here are the results:
<br /><br />Ephedra 86,507
<br />Hydroxycut 52,524
<br />Xenadrine 32,650
<br />Stacker 2 19,031
<br />Metabolife 9,819
<br />Ephedrine 42,575
<br />Green Tea 40,856
<br />Chromium 8,754
<br /><br />Let me note a few things of interest.
<br /><br />More people searched for the term &quot;ephedra&quot; during the month of May, 2006 while searching for information on a weight loss pill or diet pill than any other well known brand or ingredient.
<br /><br />But what's interesting is, most people think ephedra is illegal or no longer available. Plus, ephedra is just one herbal ingredient in many fat burners.
<br /><br />Green tea, while it has many other benefits was not searched as often as ephedra which is considered illegal by many people.
<br /><br />This is also curious. The brand name Metabolife is a brand that is no longer around. The company has gone bankrupt from lawsuits yet almost 10,000 people a month search for this once great weight loss product.
<br /><br />Another interesting point is that the word &quot;ephedrine&quot; is actually a chemical within the herbal ephedra plant, but a large number of people are searching for this chemical.
<br /><br />Ephedrine is the major reason the herbal plant, ephedra, works so well and is considered the best fat burner, certainly among the general population of people searching the internet for weight loss pills or diet pills.

These images can be transferred on any photosensitive material. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">Photography</a> includes taking and printing pictures. 
<br /><br />The backbone of photography is the camera, the instrument or device that works on the principle of optics. The camera and photographic techniques have undergone phenomenal changes since the time the first camera was made. The earlier model did not contain the film; instead, it had a small light-shield box with lens and translucent screen on either side. The image that traveled through the lens was stored on the screen. Known as '<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">camera obscura</a>,' it was no more than a sketching device for artists. 
<br /><br />Then the scientists discovered the quality of silver nitrate that changes its color when exposed to light. This was the beginning of photogram, a method of making permanent images. 
<br /><br />They would place objects on the paper dipped in silver nitrate and expose it to the sunlight. After sometime the area covered under the object stayed white while the rest of the space turned black. However, the image formed was temporary, so the method did not last long.
<br /><br />Over the centuries, the principles, the method and the material used in photography went through many changes. After experimenting with various methods like Daguerre and calotype process, finally collodion, or the wet plate technique was universally accepted. 
<br /><br />Modern photography has given a totally new meaning to the entire perception of life and privacy. Photography has made it possible to capture and preserve special moments, in private and in public life. History became more authentic with pictures, and photographs served as evidence in many cases. People made their family tree in their albums. Suddenly life was so much more fun and meaningful.
<br /><br />With the tremendous technological advances in the art of photography, it is no more just fun and frolic but has acquired the dimensions of a full-fledged profession. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">Photography</a> has many branches and types, such as: 
<br /><br />- Aerial photography is the art of taking photographs from the air.
<br /><br />- Art photography is devoted to beautiful pictures for the sake of beauty only.
<br /><br />- Studio or advertising photography is dedicated to promotion of products and institutions.
<br /><br />- Photojournalism takes pictures of events to support the news story and to create awareness among the people.
<br /><br />- Outdoor and travel photography is focused on taking pictures of landscapes and natural places.
<br /><br />- Sports photography records images of the sporting events and games that take place in the world. 
<br /><br />- Some types of photography like the macro and scientific and macro or close up photography are restricted to specific fields and are not widely known.
<br /><br />The charm of photography lies as much in the end product as in the process of taking pictures. Looking at an album is like taking a trip down memory lane; it makes us feel highly nostalgic and emotional.

Well then this article on <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">Digital Camera Photo</a> Processing is for you.
<br /><br />Remember the old days when you'd take your film down to the local photo store and you'd have them within an hour? Well that option is still available, but there may be others that you simply might not be aware of.
<br /><br />For instance there are plenty of online photo processing web-sites that can process your digital camera's photos very easily. You can then option to have your photos or even select photos sent out to you.
<br /><br />However, there are other options that you can do. For instance, rather than obtain multiple copies of prints, having them mailed out to you, and then sending those same copies to friends and relatives, you can send them online. Most of the time this service is for free. 
<br /><br />I actually do this all the time, because in addition to the cost savings, these web sites also save the photos for you online. That means you'll never have to worry about losing those wonderful photos you took.
<br /><br />One of my personal favorite web sites is Ofoto. I have found the website to be very user friendly when navigating the site and also their prices for printed photos are quite reasonable and their timliness on their shipping is also pretty good.
<br /><br />Furthermore, they also allow you to manipulate your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">photos</a> using an assortment of features, like zoom-in and cutting. While they are certainly not as powerful as some digital photo software, they are still a nice feature.
<br /><br />If you still prefer the old fashioned route of bringing your camera into a photo store for processing, then you can still do that to. Most stores have been hit pretty hard by the wave of online merchants, but if you look around your area, you can almost certainly find one. 
<br /><br />My experience has been with a camera store that is owned by a family for more than thirty years. While I could probably save money by going elsewhere, I know I will always get great service and advice from this place. Naturally I know a few things about photography, but this place always can teach me something else.

Not too long ago, when you considered choosing a photo camera, you had to take into consideration what the film would cost each time you purchased it, and what retail and photo developing stores would charge to develop any number of prints from your roll.  
<br /><br />Advancements in digital <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photography</a> devices has allowed people to advance beyond such petty thinking, and is urging them toward a new way of thinking about their digital photo taking and development needs. People no longer worry about development costs associated with a photo camera, because they know they can still print pictures at a good price, but it really is not necessary anymore.
<br /><br />When you go digital photo camera shopping, not only can you find a digital camera that will let you print your photographs on any size of photographic paper that you desire, but you have more control over the characteristics of each photograph too. There is more control in shooting the digital photographs too, because the age of digital technology gives us the power to do that.
<br /><br />The patent was for a digital photo camera was issued in 1972, but the technology and concept for the digital camera stretches back another 20 years or more. Digital photo camera shopping trips are quite different now when compared to the digital photo development process that they had to shop for back then.
<br /><br />In today’s technologically advanced society, it is necessary to consult digital photo camera buying guides before going digital photo camera shopping. The simple layman knows just enough about digital photo cameras to know that they want to point the device at someone or some landscape and click a button and have a picture waiting for them.
<br /><br />These <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">digital photo camera buying</a> guides have turned the simple minded, recreational photo camera user into a seasoned digital photographic artist. There is no need to go digital photo camera shopping and not know exactly what the features in the digital camera are able to do, or what type of photograph will be the end result of our efforts.  
<br /><br />When people go digital photo camera shopping, they know they will be able to create a digital photograph, control the image by adding textures, and other special effects, and adjust the color and contrast too.
<br /><br />When people go digital photo camera shopping, they know they no longer have to settle for pictures that are off-center, or contain unsightly objects in any part of the digital picture background. If they have objects they do not want in the background, they can now easily crop the object out and have a beautiful, and balanced photographic image to look at whenever they like.
<br /><br />When people go digital photo camera shopping, they are searching for a digital camera device that will let them maintain control over their printed picture media. There efforts for control are assisted by digital camera photo printers, and other computer printers that allow them the opportunity to print their photographs whenever they like. Photographs are attached to emails, and serve as desktop decorations for people to enjoy while they work.

How can we get a digital photo frame display? Without a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">digital photo display</a> you’ll face uncomfortable social situations.
<br /><br />Do you open your computer every time grandma comes to visit and wants to see your last pictures? Or when your neighbors come to your place for a cup of coffee and a little chat about your last journeys, you run in your office open your computer and invite everyone inside?
<br /><br />Another option is to get your camera and gather everybody around you too see the pictures. No I don’t think this is the solution, not in a million years. 
<br /><br />Imagine your boss came at your place and started asking for photos from your last trip, what will you do? You will drag him to your computer?, show him a top of papers that looks something like pictures or make him stare to your small LCD camera screen.
<br /><br />I’m not trying to sell you anything but there is a solution to these embarrassing situations, use a digital photo frame display. It’s very fancy, has great colors, and you will never be embarrassed that your pictures are looking a little funny on paper.
<br /><br />You can treat your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzhsZDNwcm8_" target="_blank">digital photo</a> frame display like any regular picture. You can keep it on a wall or on a table. For changing pictures use an USB drive, or a CD or any kind of external support that works.
<br /><br />With a digital photo frame display, pictures can be shown each one of them separate one after another, or if you want easy searches I recommend the thumbnail mode. However here are the disadvantages of digital photo frame display
<br /><br />The size of this wonder album is a problem, you can’t find an every size piece, or at least not at a reasonable price if we can speak about something like that, because as we know there is no reasonable price for fancy toys like digital photo frame displays.
<br /><br />Besides the price there is another little problem: batteries. Digital photo frame display batteries last only for eight hours, to prevent digital photo frame displaying “black screen”, make sure you never forget about the batteries.
<br /><br />A nice, still expensive toy, the digital photo frame display catches more and more buyers, which in time also works wonders on the acquisition price.

Every living being requires a certain amount of fat to exist.  Like everything in nature, it only becomes a problem when there is an imbalance.
<br /><br />The processing of fat begins when it gets absorbed in the intestines.  From there it heads to the liver.  The fat requires a delivery system to the rest of the body to be used immediately but also to be stored in fat cells for future use.
<br /><br />In order for the fat to enter the delivery system, while it is in the liver it is split into two different types of fat, cholesterol and triglycerides.  
<br /><br />Once this transformation takes place, the two types of fat (cholesterol and triglycerides) are packed into vehicles for carrying the fat to the fat cells throughout the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">body</a> using the bloodstream.  These vehicles are called lipoproteins.
<br /><br />There are three types of lipoproteins: Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL),High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) Under normal circumstances, the bloodstream does a very efficient job of carrying the LDL and HDL Lipoproteins throughout the body.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">Cholesterol</a> is a waxy, fat like substance that presents itself naturally in cell walls and membranes everywhere in your body.  Your body uses cholesterol to produce many hormones.  It also uses it to produce vitamin D and the bile acids that help to digest fat.
<br /><br />Where problems arise is when there is an over abundance of cholesterol in your bloodstream.  The cholesterol deposited by the LDL leads to a narrowing of the blood vessels. 
<br /><br />If this occurs, the excess can be deposited in the arteries of the heart which could result in stroke or heart disease.  This is called atherosclerosis.  This is why LDL is known as “<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">bad cholesterol.</a>”HDL usually collects the bad cholesterol and takes it back to the liver.  That’s why HDL is known as “good cholesterol.”
<br /><br />Cholesterol is not the only cause of heart disease, but it is a contributing factor.

		<document id="2f796444a4a8c2cf099bb96adc6a9c6a" url=""><![CDATA[Winter Photography<br/><br/>Winter photography can be treated as a part of Nature or landscape photography and also as a separate discipline. There are many people who think that all you need to take winter photographs is a nice camera, patience, the right opportunity and passion. Well! They are almost right, except that there is much more than all this put together. 
<br /><br />So, if you are thinking about becoming a photographer specializing in taking winter photographs then you need to understand some of the fundamentals. 
<br /><br />Although, the daylight hours in winter are short, it is fun working outdoors because of the variable weather patterns. Shorter days also mean that you can indulge in night <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photography</a>, which is quite challenging. 
<br /><br />The best time for taking night photographs is always around 30 minutes after sunset because all though, it may be dark but there is usually a small amount of light in the sky. Let’s proceed to look at some of the components that can enhance your winter photography skills.
<br /><br />Photography equipment is one of the most important components of any kind of photography and the first equipment to look at is the Camera. They can mainly be divided between two types, one is the Pro Camera, and the other is the amateur Camera. The advantage that the top range pro cameras like Canon EOS-1V, Nikon F5, Nikon D70, and D100 have is weatherproofing. 
<br /><br />These cameras have been developed to work in poor weather conditions and as a result they prove a worthy asset if you are interested in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">winter photography</a>. Then there are the underwater cameras like Nikonos, which can be great if you planning to take a jump in the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea. 
<br /><br />The Nikonos can work in all bad weather conditions including rainy and stormy conditions. If you have a normal or amateur camera then you will have to make alternate arrangements to take picture of a snowfall. You will have to cover the camera and lens with a plastic bag because snow or water will damage the lens.
<br /><br />Another important yet small component of a camera is the batteries. Most of the time, we are so engrossed in taking pictures that we forget to remove the batteries once the camera goes into the bag. The problem is that batteries run down faster in winter or cold weather conditions. To increase the life of the batteries, you can wrap your camera in some warm clothing like jackets.
<br /><br />A Film roll is something you cannot do without and hence, it should always be kept inside your jacket or any other warm clothes. In cold temperatures, the film can become brittle and may be difficult to load. 
<br /><br />Snow problem is something you will encounter in winter photography. The snow covered mountains or landscapes will invariably fool the exposure meter built in your camera because snow adds to the overall brightness in the scene. So, you will have to increase the exposure although the amount will differ according to the lighting conditions as well as the metering system on your camera. 
<br /><br />Using flash is an important aspect of taking spectacular winter photographs. If you are trying to shoot an animal in the snow then you will have to use fill in flash in the snow. The flash will help you to maintain a natural look if kept between -2/3 to -2 stops. 
<br /><br />Remember, photography is not something you can learn in a day or two with a tutorial. It requires practical exposure. So go out there and start shooting some real ones!

<br /><br />Newspapers have reported on the drawbacks of having a diet high in fat. High-fat diet has been linked to high cholesterol and ultimately to heart attacks. Hence, people have started avoiding beef and eggs. But cholesterol is not bad. Our body needs it to protect nerves and build new cells and hormones. It is only when we include foods like pizzas, burgers, ice creams, steaks or any food containing animal product that the problem starts. 
<br /><br />Excess cholesterol settles along the walls of the arteries and can clog them thus, restricting blood flow. This gives rise to angina, heart attack or stroke. It has also been shown that high cholesterol leads to gallstones. There are two types of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">cholesterol called good cholesterol</a> or HDL and bad cholesterol or LDL. LDL is the cholesterol that clogs the arteries and should be lower while HDL scours the artery walls and removes the harmful LDL and should be higher.
<br /><br />Doctors recommend reducing and avoiding high-fat diets containing meat, eggs and dairy products. But you can use the following home remedies for treatment:
<br /><br />• Increase the intake of Vitamin E: It is advised to increase your intake of Vitamin E to 400 international units to prevent the oxidation of bad cholesterol where the cholesterol hardens into the arterial plaque thus giving rise to heart attack. It also raises the level of HDL. You can include Vitamin E as dietary sources or include vegetable oils, nuts or grains in your diet.
<br /><br />• Eat your breakfast: People who skip the breakfast have higher cholesterol levels than those who have breakfast everyday. This is because they tend to eat unhealthy foods which are high in fats.
<br /><br />• Eat small meals frequently: Large meals have been shown to release a large amount of insulin, which in turn stimulates the production of the enzymes that increases cholesterol production by the liver. But eating small frequent meals without increasing the total calories will limit the insulin production and thus controls the cholesterol and in turn heart diseases.
<br /><br />• Add Vitamin C to your diet: Though other vitamins and minerals play an important role in the cholesterol production, Vitamin C is the most crucial vitamin for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">cholesterol control</a>. It increases HDL levels and is very beneficial if you get it from fruits and vegetables, since they have a special fibre called pectin. It surrounds the cholesterol and flushes it out of the digestive system before it gets into the blood. Include fruits like citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, apples and spinach which are rich in vitamin C and pectin.
<br /><br />• Increase garlic intake: Taking seven cloves of garlic a day will reduce cholesterol levels significantly. If you cannot stand the normal garlic, then you can opt for odorless garlic pills, which are available in local health stores.
<br /><br />• Skip decaf: Avoid decaffeinated coffee since it has been shown to raise LDL levels. This is because the beans used for decaf are far stronger than the normal beans.
<br /><br />• Munch grapes: Grapes and their products have a compound which lowers cholesterol significantly. So you can increase your intake of grapes, grape juice and wine to decrease your cholesterol level.
<br /><br />• Have grapefruit: Grapefruit contains pectin which reduces cholesterol significantly. Hence, people who consume grapefruits show a marked decline of cholesterol over 7 percent after two months of consumption.
<br /><br />• Eat beans: Lima beans, kidney beans, navy beans, soybeans and other legumes have been shown to lower cholesterol as they have a high amount of pectin. Research has shown that people who consume about 11/2 cup of cooked beans a day have decreased their cholesterol levels by 20 percent within three weeks.
<br /><br />• Splurge on carrots: Carrots have plenty of pectin, the most useful type of fibre for lowering cholesterol. Having about 2 to 3 carrots a day will reduce cholesterol levels by 10 to 20 percent.

Additionally, a dexterous hand at being able to experiment with light and shadows will bring out the depths and tones in your pictures.
<br /><br />There are three very important aspects of photographing women:
<br /><br />Setting the surrounding or the scene: How the photographs really come out depends a lot on the immediate surrounding. The subject’s expressions can also vary with the surrounding. If you are trying to take a photograph in the middle of a bustling street then your subject may also feel the crowd around her and this can easily affect her expressions. On the other hand, a photograph on a secluded waterfront might bring out the best expressions. Creativity plays an important role; the more creative you are regarding the settings, the better the photograph will be.
<br /><br />Lighting Conditions: Lighting conditions are important for getting the best out of a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3Rpbnl1cmwuY29tLzh2eWt3Njc_" target="_blank">photograph</a>. Too much or too less light can expose the photograph and destroy its effect. The best option is to have a soft bulb light, which works better than a flash. Always remember, to place the light source either on the subjects left side or the right side. This will bring out the details in the face. You can always experiment with the position of the light and even bounce it off the ceiling but never place it in the front, as it will lead to reflection in the photograph. You can also use a soft side light for creating shadows and use a filler flash to light up the face of the model. 
<br /><br />Getting it right: Getting the ‘perfect’ shot during female photography shoot, is a challenging task. Try to use a long lens and take the picture moving away from the subject. You can also use a tripod to get a steady shot. Most of the top-notch female photographers use a small aperture and a long shutter speed. Last but not the least; you need to take as many shots as possible with different expressions so that you can get the perfect shot. 
<br /><br />Women are enigmatic and mysterious. Female photography is an ode to this most beautiful creation of God!

<br /><br />Cholesterol is a fatty lipid, steroid and an alcohol found in the body tissues and blood plasma of vertebrates. It is the cardinal part of the outer membranes of human body cells and it circulates in the blood of humans. Cholesterol in the human body comes from two major sources – diet, and the liver, where it is produced internally. 
<br /><br />High cholesterol in the blood is considered to be unhealthy. The cholesterol levels in the bloodstream can influence the pathogenesis of certain conditions, such as the development of atherosclerotic plaque and coronary artery disease. It gets collected on the walls of arteries and interferes with the flow of blood. This buildup of cholesterol in the blood vessels may constrict the passages considerably and inhibit the flow of blood to and from the heart.
<br /><br />Recent researches have revealed that the abundance of protein complexes, called lipoproteins are responsible for the cholesterol build-up in the blood vessels. Elevated levels of bad cholesterol (low density lipoprotein or LDL), are responsible for heart disease. 
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">Cholesterol in your diet</a>:
<br /><br />A high cholesterol diet is considered an unwholesome diet. Diets which are rich in animal fats, meat, poultry, fish, oils, egg yolks and dairy products, are a rich source of cholesterol. Organ meats, such as liver, are extremely rich in cholesterol. A diet high in cholesterol is fatal for the heart.
<br /><br />Healthy diets are considered effective to lower cholesterol. A low cholesterol diet contains extremely low or no cholesterol at all. Diets of plant origin are the best low cholesterol diets.
<br /><br />Fat is the major source of energy for the body, but excessive fat in the diet is dangerous. The excess fat raises <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovLzAwYjVianJtcGoybjNrOGp5aWlhZzl6aWFoLmhvcC5jbGlja2JhbmsubmV0Lz90aWQ9NDAwMTIx" target="_blank">blood cholesterol levels</a>. It’s bad for the circulatory system and causes heart attack or stroke. The amount of fat and cholesterol in a diet should just be according to the daily calories required by the body. Thus a perfectly balanced diet is considered a healthy diet. 
<br /><br />A perfect low cholesterol diet has the following features:
<br /><br />•	It’s low in fat (especially saturated fat). 
<br />•	It contains low cholesterol.
<br />•	It contains low sodium contents. 
<br />•	It’s rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates.
<br />•	It’s usually a low calorie diet. 
<br /><br />Besides taking low cholesterol diets, sugar and alcohol consumption should also be reduced, as they contribute to high cholesterol levels. 
<br /><br />Avoid eating at fast food restaurants, because fast foods are usually high in fats and sodium. 
<br /><br />Regular exercise can also reduce cholesterol levels.
<br /><br />Recent studies have revealed that certain deep-sea fish -- mackerel, salmon, herring, albacore tuna, and lake trout -- contain an oil called Omega-3 fatty acid that may help to lower blood cholesterol.
