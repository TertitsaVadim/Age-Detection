<br />I didn’t know what I was doing at the time but now I realise how much of a loser I was to let u go. I shattered both of hearts into millions of pieces with out even knowing. Now your gone baby I realise how much I love you how much I need you in my life to make it whole. Trying to love another is just impossible u was the one for me but it’s to late now. How stupid I was in the first place to leave u to suffer with out realising thinking you wouldn’t care and u was better of with out me maybe I was wrong cause now look where you are no where, you are gone. I can’t do any thing but remember all the good times we had together and remember al the things u taught me and told me. In my head all I hear is your voice going over and over again saying I love you. You could never say it enough just if I believed you. Just if I realised all this before it was to late, now I have to suffer loving some one I can’t be with for the rest of my life. I want you to be hear by my side so I could tell you face to face how I really feel about you.

<br />Not thinking straight then suddenly, I brake a promises I made to a loved one.
<br />A razor blade sliding across my skin, with blood rushing out. Dropping the razor with realizing what I had done. But it was too late I couldn’t take it back laying back down on my pillow with a puddle of blood underneath my arm where the blood was still coming out. But why does this seem to happen every night? Is this a punishment for my self or just a pain relief? All I know is that when it happens I think of you and the pain you have caused me. And how much of a failure I am for letting you leave my life.

Being hurt confused depressed and not many making it through teen years then the complications’ of the real world. Why cant life be a happy place its not like we get a second chance so the first chance should be the best ever the happiest ever. Yes people make mistakes and people find out, so people shouldn’t judge people by their mistakes in life because we only live one life. Just forgive and forget.
<br />        I never want to bring another into this horrible world so they have to suffer like I had and have to and I bet more suffering to happen in the future. Its just not worth having to be down cause u see your own going through the same pain as you did all those years ago. I don’t see the point. I think we should put an end to all of this and go back to the wonderful 60’s where every one was happy. yeah maybe they didn’t have to best fashion but who cares, its feelings what mean more then what you look like.
