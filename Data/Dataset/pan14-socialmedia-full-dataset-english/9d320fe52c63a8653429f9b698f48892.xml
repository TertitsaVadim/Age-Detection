These terms are abbreviated as we see in the following example: 10.8V, 4000mAh
<br />what do these terms mean, and why should you care about the specifications of laptop computer batteries?<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Volts - or V - are an electrical measure of energy potential. You can think of it as the pressure being exerted by all the electrons at a laptop computer batteries negative terminal as they try to move to the positive terminal. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Amps - or A - is an abbreviation of Ampere, a 19th century French scientist who was a pioneer in electricity research. Amps measure the volume of electrons passing through a wire in a one second. One Amp equals 6.25 x 1018 electrons per second.
<br /><br />Amp hours - or Ah - measures capacity. That is what we want to know about laptop computer batteries - how long can it deliver a certain amount of charge before it runs out. As with all metric measurements, Amps can be divided into smaller (or larger) units by adding a prefix. In the case of laptop computer batteries, a milliAmp hour (mAh) is most commonly used. Note that 1000 mAh is the same a 1 Ah. (Just as 1000mm equals 1 meter.)
<br /><br />Note that Amp hours do not dictate the flow of electrons at any given moment. Laptop batteries with a 1 Amp hour rating could deliver Amp of current for 2 hours, or they could provide 2 Amps of current for hour. To understand how much current your computer pulls from its battery, see our article on &quot;Laptop Power Consumption and Battery Life&quot;.
<br /><br />Typically, laptop computer batteries will use 1 to 3 Amps per hour, depending on the model's processor speed, screen size, screen brightness adjustment, usage of the CD, DVD, or Floppy drives, and other factors.
<br /><br />Keep in mind that slight variations in voltage generally do not impact the performance of your laptop. We see this all the time with universal and external batteries. The original laptop battery might be specified at 10.8 Volts, but customers using a universal part can operate their laptop safely at either the 10 or 11 Volt setting.

When you use your notebook battery as described above, you are needlessly using your supply of recharges.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />One additional note: many people recall that older notebook batteries on early computers worked best when they were fully discharged before being recharged. While that remains true for Nickel Cadmium technology, today's Lithium Ion notebook batteries work best when they are recharged when they still have 10 to 20% capacity remaining. So if you are using your notebook battery on a long flight, try not to get in the habit of using the notebook battery until it has almost no charge. Your laptop battery literally won't be the same when you re-charge it the next time.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>Some Guidelines for Notebook Batteries: 
<br />•Remember that new laptop batteries generally arrive in a discharged state; you must charge them up for at least four hours before their first use. 
<br />•Keep your laptop battery cool, but do not put it in the refrigerator or freezer 
<br />•Don't use the notebook battery if you don't have to! Many people keep their laptop plugged in most of the time. They can preserve their notebook battery life by storing the battery outside the laptop in a cool place. 
<br />•Try to avoid running your laptop battery all the way to zero 
<br />•Don't charge your notebook battery before long periods of inactivity 
<br />•Much as we'd like to sell you more laptop batteries, don't buy spare notebook batteries for later use. The longer you hold them, the less useful life they provide.

		<document id="d739cf6c4c54987ec621072202757a32" url=""><![CDATA[Can Your Laptop Battery be Overcharged?<br/><br/>Most laptops today use lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries. Overcharging Li-ion batteries is not a problem and does not affect the battery life span. These batteries can be charged 300 to 500 times, and they have an internal circuit to stop the charging process at full charge. The control system prevents overcharging, which can cause the lithium ion battery to overheat and potentially burn. This is why the Li-ion batteries are more expensive. The only way for the Li-ion battery to overcharge is if the charging system malfunctions, and then the battery will heat up while in the charger. If you don't plan to use your laptop for long period of time, you can extend the life of your lithium ion laptop battery by storing it with a 50 percent charge. A fully discharged battery left for a long period of time will lose its charging capacity. Fully charged batteries discharge when they are left unused, and will lose effectiveness. This is why it is recommended to discharge a Li-ion battery until it is almost out before shutting down. Running a Li-ion battery down completely will diminish capacity. Keep the battery in a cool place and do not store your computer for a long period of time while it is fully charged.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Older laptops use Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) and Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. They require more maintenance than Lithium Ion batteries. They must be fully discharged and then fully recharged so that they don't lose battery life. These batteries can be overcharged only if they go through too many cycles of charging and discharging, which reduces their effectiveness and capacity. It is better to charge all batteries fully before use; then use on battery power until the optimum level for each battery type is reached, before recharging. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>

		<document id="146d7477b25ca6fdbd5a65dd7ac4b3cd" url=""><![CDATA[How Computer Batteries Work<br/><br/>Imagine a world where everything that used electricity had to be plugged in. Flashlights, hearing aids, cell phones and other portable devices would be tethered to electrical outlets, rendering them awkward and cumbersome. Cars couldn't be started with the simple turn of a key; a strenuous cranking would be required to get the pistons moving. Wires would be strung everywhere, creating a safety hazard and an unsightly mess. Thankfully, batteries provide us with a mobile source of power that makes many modern conveniences possible.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />While there are many different types of batteries, the basic concept by which they function remains the same. When a device is connected to a battery, a reaction occurs that produces electrical energy. This is known as an electrochemical reaction. Italian physicist Count Alessandro Volta first discovered this process in 1799 when he created a simple battery from metal plates and brine-soaked cardboard or paper. Since then, scientists have greatly improved upon Volta's original design to create batteries made from a variety of materials that come in a multitude of sizes. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Today, batteries are all around us. They power our wristwatches for months at a time. They keep our alarm clocks and telephones working, even if the electricity goes out. They run our smoke detectors, electric razors, power drills, mp3 players, thermostats -- and the list goes on. If you're reading this article on your laptop or smart phone, you may even be using batteries right now! However, because these portable power packs are so prevalent, it's very easy to take them for granted. This article will give you a greater appreciation for batteries by exploring their history, as well as the basic parts, reactions and processes that make them work. So cut that cord and click through our informative guide to charge up your knowledge of batteries.

		<document id="13d68330e18ab03f2fd1eeca56c02467" url=""><![CDATA[Laptop Battery Power Consumption and Life<br/><br/>Every laptop battery carries a certain &quot;reservoir,&quot; or capacity of charge per cycle. Much like your car's gas tank, you fill it up every so often and then use the gas bit by bit. In the case of a laptop battery, the tank usually holds 2,500 to 4000 milliAmp hours. (For an explanation of Amp hours, see our article on Volts and Amps.)<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br /><br />Just like your car, your laptop computer battery lasts longer depending on how you &quot;drive&quot; your laptop. Many laptop users are familiar with the Power Management settings icon in the Control Panel, which allows the user to control use of the laptop battery. This control forces your laptop to conserve its fuel by limiting the operation of the highest energy-consuming functions. Unfortunately, there is a trade-off between computer performance and energy conservation.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />The key &quot;consumers&quot; of the laptop battery are the processor, the screen, wireless networking cards; drives such as the hard drive, The more these functions are used, the faster your laptop battery will run out of juice. (Note that you &quot;use&quot; your screen more when its brightness is set to high; to conserve laptop battery power, dim the screen.) DVD movies are a major culprit when it comes to laptop computer battery drain because both the drive and the screen must be run at full power for as long as two hours.
<br /><br />With the &quot;pedal to the metal,&quot; your laptop computer battery uses as much as 2500 milliAmps per hour, meaning that a 3000 mAh laptop battery would last for just over an hour. You can reduce the laptop batteries use by up to 75% with intelligent use of your laptop.
<br /><br />This connection between laptop computer battery life and laptop usage patterns explains why we cannot answer the often-asked question: How long will my laptop run with your new laptop battery? Unfortunately, all we can say is: &quot;it depends&quot;. Just as with a car, your mileage will vary.

		<document id="c0c6f99bcae0e80e10fca9d3e263bc8c" url=""><![CDATA[Gaming computer<br/><br/>A gaming computer (also gaming PC and gaming rig) is a personal computer that is capable of playing computationally demanding video games. Gaming computers are very similar to conventional PCs, with the main difference being the addition of a performance-oriented video card. Gaming computers are often associated with enthusiast computing due to an overlap in interests. However, while a gaming PC is built to achieve performance for actual game play, enthusiast PCs are built to maximize performance, using games as a benchmark. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />The difference between the two carries a large discrepancy in the cost of the system. Whereas enthusiast PCs are high-end by definition, gaming PCs can be subdivided into low-end, mid-range, and high-end segments. Contrary to the popular misconception that PC gaming is inextricably tied to high-priced enthusiast computing, video card manufacturers earn the bulk of their revenue from their low-end and mid-range offerings. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Because of the large variety of parts that can go into a computer built to play video games, gaming computers are typically custom-made, rather than pre-assembled, either by gaming and hardware enthusiasts or by companies such as Alien ware, AVA direct, Gateway, Voodoo PC, V3 Gaming PC, Landslide Gaming PCs, Origin PC and Gaming PC that specialize in producing custom gaming machines. In order to generate interest, gaming computer manufacturers that sell complete systems often produce boutique models, allowing them to compete on aesthetic design in addition to the hardware inside.

		<document id="332657d74bdff5e519f3baacb91c2d3f" url=""><![CDATA[History of Laptops<br/><br/>As the personal computer became feasible in the early 1970s, the idea of a portable personal computer followed. A &quot;personal, portable information manipulator&quot; was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968, and described in his 1972 paper as the &quot;Dynabook&quot;.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />The IBM SCAMP project (Special Computer APL Machine Portable), was demonstrated in 1973. This prototype was based on the PALM processor (Put All Logic In Microcode).
<br />The IBM 5100, the first commercially available portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based on the SCAMP prototype.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />As 8-bit CPU machines became widely accepted, the number of portables increased rapidly. The Osborne 1, released in 1981, used the Zilog Z80 and weighed 23.6 pounds (10.7 kg). It had no battery, a 5 in (13 cm) CRT screen, and dual 5.25 in (13.3 cm) single-density floppy drives. In the same year the first laptop-sized portable computer, the Epson HX-20, was announced. The Epson had a LCD screen, a rechargeable battery, and a calculator-size printer in a 1.6 kg (3.5 l<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> chassis. Both Tandy/RadioShack and HP also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period.
<br /><br />The first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early 1980s. The Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981–82, but was not marketed internationally until 1984–85. The $8,150 ($18,540 today) GRiD Compass 1100, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the military among others. The Gavilan SC, released in 1983, was the first computer described as a &quot;laptop&quot; by its manufacturer. From 1983 onward, several new input techniques were developed and included in laptops, including the touchpad (Gavilan SC, 1983), the pointing stick (IBM ThinkPad 700, 1992) and handwriting recognition (Linus Write-Top, 1987). Some CPUs, such as the 1990 Intel i386SL, were designed to use minimum power to increase battery life of portable computers, and were supported by dynamic power management features such as Intel SpeedStep and AMD PowerNow!

		<document id="96a9a7a3c8078d12ae46fb693d73b941" url=""><![CDATA[Home theater PC<br/><br/>A Home Theater PC (HTPC) is a convergence device that combines some or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that supports photo, music playback, and sometimes video recording functionality. Although computers with some of these capabilities were available from the late 1980s, the &quot;Home Theater PC&quot; term first appeared in mainstream press in 1996. In recent years, other types of consumer electronics, including gaming systems and dedicated media devices have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term &quot;media center&quot; also refers to specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computers. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />An HTPC and other convergence devices integrate components of a home theater into a unit co-located with a home entertainment system. An HTPC system typically has a remote control and the software interface normally has a 10-foot user interface design so that it can be comfortably viewed at typical television viewing distances. An HTPC can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add video programming or music to the PC. Enthusiasts can also piece together a system out of discrete components as part of a software-based HTPC. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a> 
<br />Since 2007 digital media receiver software has been incorporated into consumer electronics through software or hardware changes including gaming systems, blu-ray players, televisions, and set top boxes. The increased availability of specialized devices, coupled with paid and free digital content, now offer alternatives to multipurpose (and more costly) personal computers.

		<document id="c010e8103ae18f4175486ca19931d20f" url=""><![CDATA[A Laptop Computer<br/><br/>A laptop computer or simply laptop, also called a notebook computer, is a small personal computer designed for portability. Usually all of the interface hardware needed to operate the laptop, such as USB ports (previously parallel and serial ports), graphics card, sound channel, etc., is built in to a single unit. Laptops contain high capacity batteries that can power the device for extensive periods of time, enhancing portability. Once the battery charge is depleted, it will have to be recharged through a power outlet. In the interest of saving power, weight and space, they usually share RAM with the video channel, slowing their performance compared to an equivalent desktop machine. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">lap ac adapters</a>  
<br /><br />One main drawback of the laptop is sometimes, due to the size and configuration of components, relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design. Internal upgrades are either not manufacturer recommended, can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge, or in some cases impossible, making the desktop PC more modular. Some internal upgrades, such as memory and hard disks upgrades are often easy, a display or keyboard upgrade is usually impossible. The laptop has the same access as the desktop to the wide variety of devices, such as external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards, which may be attached externally through USB ports and other less common ports such as external video.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />A subtype of notebooks, called subnotebooks, are computers with most of the features of a standard laptop computer but smaller. They are larger than hand-held computers, and usually run full versions of desktop/laptop operating systems.

If you plan to use your laptop to check email, browse the internet or listen to music, you don’t need anything too powerful. However, if you plan to travel with your computer, store many files or documents and access information, you want a device with a long battery life, adequate hard-disk space, a memory-card reader, and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>Below are the criteria we used to evaluate laptop computers.
<br />Design
<br />The main purpose of a laptop computer is portability. Each computer offers different dimensions, so it is vital that you look at the device before you buy it to ensure it is not too large. Laptops offer a vast selection of display features. You can find a screen size on one of these devices ranging from 11 inches up to 17 inches. You may find these computers in an assortment of colors from black and brown to bright green or orange. The top laptops are also ENERGY STAR qualified, meaning they have energy-efficient features.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br /><br />Performance
<br />The best laptops feature a fast processor. You don’t want to wait around all day for files to download or applications to open. You also need a video card and an operating system that performs well and is user friendly.

These PCs can often be more expensive than building one's own, with higher premiums attached to high-end brands with varying levels of customer service. Different companies offer varying degrees of customization, some almost as much as building it oneself. There are however, drawbacks to building one's own computer. Assembling a computer means being personally responsible for any problems that may arise, both during the assembly phase, and after it's in regular use. Instead of using a single technical support hotline to cover your entire system, often one will have to deal with individual component manufactures.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>Due to the wide inconsistencies in after-purchase support from component manufactures, trying to get support can be a daunting task for even the most patient of people. Customer support is a major reason why even extreme gaming enthusiasts may look to a system integrator for their custom PC builds. There are many positive aspects in choosing to build one's own system, such as no longer being tied to specific configurations. Pricing on individual components is often better, and thus can save quite a lot of money on a comparable pre-built system. Warranties are often included with the price of each individual piece of hardware when building your own PC, whereas a prebuilt PC's warranty may cost an additional fee or may be as little as 1 or 2 years for the entire system. Those who choose to build their own PC often seek help from an online community or forum in the absence of a consumer helpline.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>

First statement, core and battery are two concepts. A cell is by several bigger than your thumb, cylindrical, about 7, 8 cm high, voltage of 3.6 v of the small unit, professional way is called 18650, sanyo and samsung is the biggest producers. Core, like a small battery, laptop battery after series combination, is we see the battery. So the use time of laptop batteries has become the important factors embodied notebook performance. Most laptop computers use the time will not be too long, so how to make your laptop to the more province electricity became the key of using notebook. <a href="/" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>Consist of housing, circuit boards laptop batteries and composed, belongs to the core lithium ion batteries. Generally they say core is refers to the number of core cell, mAh refers to the capacity of the laptop batteries.The main circuit board by the protection circuit , and capacity instructions circuit two parts, the charging and discharging of notebook battery and safety management.Notebook battery of standby time mainly by the mAh value to decide. Usually, electricity, the more mAh value some, the greater the standby time is longer. Notebook battery life mainly by the cycle count to measure, quality qualified products generally for 500-600 times. So, effectively use the laptop batteries for 2 years, expired within batteries will aging, standby time sharply and influence the mobility of notebook computer. <a href="/" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>The notebook most used lithium battery, with 13 inch adapters for more than more than 6 core of large capacity battery, more than 13 inch laptop and the in order to guarantee the portability, many products chose frivolous 3 core or so the battery.

The word nettop is a portmanteau of Internet and desktop.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adaptars</a>Compared to ordinary desktop computers, nettops are not only smaller and cheaper, they also consume much less power. For example, CompuLab's fit-PC2 consumes no more than 8 watts of power whereas a typical desktop would easily consume more than 100 watts of power. Consequently, nettops are often fanless with an external power supply. Some do not have an optical disk drive and use a solid state disk, making them completely silent. The trade off is that the hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make nettops less appropriate for running complex or resource intensive applications. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>There are three platforms that are primarily intended for nettops and netbooks:
<br />•Intel's Centrino Atom platform. 
<br />•Nvidia's Ion platform.
<br />•VIA's Trinity Platform. 
<br />Some nettops have also adopted system-on-a-chip designs. Although many major parts such as chipsets, video cards and storage devices can also be found on desktops, the CPUs that are put inside nettops are the fundamental component that differentiates them from normal desktops.

In discount laptop batteries, the trick is to find an electrochemical reaction that provides the right mix of stability, safety, sustainability, physical size, weight, charge capacity, lifespan, environmental impact, and manufacturing cost.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />For the laptop computer industry, two technologies stand head and shoulders above the rest: Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) and Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH). First, we'll look at Li-Ion, which dominates the laptop battery marketplace at the moment. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />In Li-Ion batteries, electrons move from Lithium Oxide to Graphite. Each Lithium Ion cell carries 3.6V, and anywhere from 6 to 12 are packed inside discount laptop batteries. Because of the way the cells are wired inside the laptop battery, the voltage is an even multiple of 3.6 - usually 10.8 or 14.4.
<br /><br />Lithium discount laptop batteries offer higher energy density than any other metal, and the chemical reaction carries no &quot;memory effect&quot;, meaning that the laptop battery does not need to be fully discharged to maintain its peak level of recharge. In addition, Li-Ion discount laptop batteries experience lower levels of self-discharging compared to Ni-MH and other chemistries.

		<document id="1a5a2a9e1dc72a638fbb6ae5a5bf35d8" url=""><![CDATA[Li-Ion laptop batteries<br/><br/>On the downside, the Li-Ion electrochemical reaction needs to monitor more closely than with other chemistries. In particular, all Li-Ion laptop batteries must have a microprocessor inside their case to control the charge and discharge rate, and to monitor the temperature and capacity status. This adds to the cost of the laptop battery and can make troubleshooting a faulty laptop battery more complicated. Fortunately, battery manufacturers have developed inexpensive and highly effective methods to ensure the safety of cheap laptop batteries.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Prior to Li-Ion, Ni-MH laptop batteries were the standard used by all notebook manufacturers. In a Ni-MH battery, the electrical current moves from Nickel oxy-hydroxide to a metal alloy, and the cells carry 1.2 Volts each. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Ni-MH was a vast improvement over its predecessor technology, Nickel Cadmium (Ni-Cd), because it suffers no memory effect, has a larger capacity, and was non-toxic to the environment. (Cadmium is a heavy metal.) On the down side, NiCd loses about 10% of its capacity within 1 day of being charged, and it has a much shorter lifespan than either Ni-Cd or Li-Ion.
<br /><br />For the most part, a laptop user has little choice in the matter of which laptop battery chemistry to choose. Some models are designed to accept either chemistry, but the notebook manufacturer must design this capability into their model in order for the user to have a choice.

The power supply is visible from the back of many systems because it contains the power-cord receptacle and the cooling fan.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Power supplies, often referred to as &quot;switching power supplies&quot;, use switcher technology to convert the AC input to lower DC voltages. The typical voltages supplied are: 
<br />•3.3 volts 
<br />•5 volts 
<br />•12 volts  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />The 3.3- and 5-volts are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12-volt is used to run motors in disk drives and fans. The main specification of a power supply is in watts. A watt is the product of the voltage in volts and the current in amperes or amps. If you have been around PCs for many years, you probably remember that the original PCs had large red toggle switches that had a good bit of heft to them. When you turned the PC on or off, you knew you were doing it. These switches actually controlled the flow of 120 volt power to the power supply. 
<br /><br />Today you turn on the power with a little push button, and you turn off the machine with a menu option. These capabilities were added to standard power supplies several years ago. The operating system can send a signal to the power supply to tell it to turn off. The push button sends a 5-volt signal to the power supply to tell it when to turn on. The power supply also has a circuit that supplies 5 volts, called VSB for &quot;standby voltage&quot; even when it is officially &quot;off&quot;, so that the button will work.

MythTV provided a free and open source solution using Linux. The concept was to combine a digital tuner with digital video recording, program guides, and computer capabilities with a 10-foot user interface. XBMC was another free and open software project started with re-purposing the Xbox as a home theater PC but has since been ported to Windows and Macintosh operating systems in various forms including Boxee and Plex. By early 2006, commercial examples of this integration included the Mac mini which had the Apple Remote, 5.1 digital audio, and an updated Front Row interface that would play shared media. Because of these features and the Mini's small form factor, consumers began using the Mini as a Mac-based home theater PC.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br /> As digital cable and satellite became the norm, HTPC software became more dependent on external decoder boxes, and the subscription costs that came with them. For instance, Myth TV is capable of capturing unencrypted HDTV streams, such as those broadcast over the air or on cable using a QAM tuner. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />The advent of the fully digital HDTV displays helped to complete the value and ease of use of a HTPC system. Digital projectors, plasma and LCD displays often came pre-configured to accept computer video outputs including VGA, DVI and Component Video. Furthermore, both the computers and the displays could include video sealers to better conform the image to the screen format and resolutions. Likewise, computers also included HDMI ports that carry both audio and video signals to home video displays or AV Receivers.
<br /><br />The simplified integration of computer and home theater displays has allowed for fully digital content distribution over the internet. For instance, by 2007 Netflix &quot;watch instantly&quot; subscribers could view streaming content using their HTPCs with a browser or with plug-ins with applications like Boxee, Plex, and XBMC.

Hard drives come in PATA (parallel ATA interface, outdated) and SATA (serial ATA interface). SATA has three specifications. SATA I can transfer up to 1.5Gbs (gigabits per second); SATA II can transfer up to 3Gbs; SATA III can transfer up to 6Gbs. Higher transfer rates are more desirable. Hard drives are also evaluated as SSD (solid state drive) or spinning-platter type. SSDs have no moving parts and use much less energy than spinning hard drives. SSDs are evaluated by read and write speed. Spinning platter hard drives are evaluated by RPMs--5400 is standard, 7200 is nice and 10,000 RPM is cutting-edge. Hard drives are also evaluated by size. SSDs typically range from 16 to 160GB, while spinning platter hard drives range from 80GB to over 1TB (terabyte). Bigger is better.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Evaluate the optical drive. CD is the smallest capacity for read/write options (700M<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" />. DVD and dual-layer DVD hold more information (4.7 and 8.5GB, respectively). Bluray is currently the premium optical drive type with the ability to hold 25GB on a single-layer disc. Drives that have write capabilities are better than drives that can only read media discs. Evaluate optic drives by read and write speeds.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Evaluate ports. USB is becoming the most important connection interface on modern computers. USB 1 and 1.1 are obsolete specifications. USB 2.0 is forty times faster than USB 1.1 and USB 3.0 is more than ten times faster than USB 2.0. Advanced video ouputs include DVI or HDMI, with the common VGA output being obsolete. SPDIF is a digital audio output (requiring digital speakers).
<br /><br />Evaluate the video card. The older specification AGP cards are obsolete. PCI interface cards have evolved from PCI to PCI-X, versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. Later specifications are more desirable. A video card can further be evaluated for processor speed and available video memory, with premium cards having 1GB or more of memory.

It plays a central role in your PC working. It is capable of holding the system, operating applications and also the files that are open on your system. When you are working on your system and you open up your favorite gaming software or launch your favorite video into the PC, the instructions that are given by us are loaded into the system's RAM and CPU is responsible for fetching those instructions from the RAM and thereby executing the same. Even a windows based desktop would also be having certain amount of RAM for the functioning. Therefore it is understandable that if any computer has more RAM it would be able to handle more applications simultaneously, implying that it would be able to open up faster and at the same time would be able to effectively handle multidimensional applications at the same time. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />But the big question is as to how much memory is required by your system? And how much is ‘TOO' much for you to handle and otherwise what are the type of RAM that are ideal for your system? Should you be actually satisfied with a low performing but a cheap computer, or would you be happy with investing that extra money on your system upgrade to see it performing well. Actually it all boils down to the fact as to what is it that you are looking for your system to perform? After all the requirements differ from one system to another; for example the Windows XP system that is slated to run at SDRAM 256MB RAM actually performs well at the levels of 512 MB of RAM.  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>

The main components include the processor, hard drive, memory, optical drive and video card. Speed is usually indicated in hertz, while size is usually indicated in bytes. Connectors and ports are evaluated by specification.<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop ac adapters</a>
<br />Step 1
<br />Check the speed of the central processor. Laptops should be a minimum of 1GHZ (gigahertz), while desktops can be over 3GHz. The front side bus (FS<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> should be 800MHZ to 1600MHz. New Intel processors do not use FSBs. Intel and AMD now offer processors with more than one core--essentially two or more processors in one chip. Two or four cores is better for multitasking or heavy graphics use. Intel also offers hyperthreading, further splitting each core into essentially two cores. For smaller systems, energy consumption of the processor may be of concern. Faster processors generally use more power (over 100 watts). Laptop processors may use 50 watts or less to prolong battery life. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Step 2
<br />Check the RAM. RAM (random access memory) comes in several specifications, including DDR, DDR2 and DDR3. Higher speeds (800MHz and up) are more desirable. The RAM has to be compatible with the FSB on the motherboard and with the central processor. Larger RAM modules are also more desirable, with 3GB (gigabytes) maximum for 32-bit operating systems and up to 16GB or more for 64-bit operating systems.

<br />System software
<br />System software provides the basic functions for computer usage and helps run the computer hardware and system. It includes a combination of the following:
<br />•Device drivers 
<br />•Operating systems 
<br />•Servers 
<br />•Utilities 
<br />•Window systems 
<br />System software is responsible for managing a variety of independent hardware components, so that they can work together harmoniously. Its purpose is to unburden the application software programmer from the often complex details of the particular computer being used, including such accessories as communications devices, printers, device readers, displays and keyboards, and also to partition the computer's resources such as memory and processor time in a safe and stable manner. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wb3dlcnNzaG9wLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">laptop battery</a>
<br />Programming software

<br />•Compilers 
<br />•Debuggers 
<br />•Interpreters 
<br />•Linkers 
<br />•Text editors 
<br />An Integrated development environment (IDE) is a single application that attempts to manage all these functions.
