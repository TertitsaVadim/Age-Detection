This is the stuff nightmares are made of. <br /><br />Death is a clear theme, not only in terms of war imagery; the war imagery used in 'Heaven from Hell' is only expedient to the expression of the pain a dead soul, forced to roam the world of the living, encounters: the wars referred to in 'Heaven from Hell' are not the effort of conflicting armies, they are at the same time the Punic War and the Gulf War, yet even more precisely, they are the war of the human soul against its own destructiveness. <br /><br />Shakespere takes centre stage in 'Hevaen from Hell', of course with the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and his lover Ophelia. Hamlet's suicidal thoughts permeate this piece and and human life, in a reversal of fortune, becomes an imitation of the theatre. Hamlet does not die in 'Heaven from Hell' yet Ophelia does, and while the hero attends her funeral, he shouts out, &quot;- Shit! This poem needs an epitaph!&quot; The poem is conscious of its aesthetic and literary existence, Ophelia receives her epitaph, yet Hamlet is left a dead soul in the world of the living who &quot;cannot drop&quot; the dramatic &quot;curtain&quot; over his own suffering. <br /><br />'Heaven from Hell' is a colossal attempt to come to terms with the poet/speaker's own mortality, with the demise of Westen culture and its illegitimacy: the metamyth presented is one of inhernet tragedy. It is a journey through Hell with no slution and no end, in fact, previous editions of the poem had the subtitle 'A fragment', so reminiscent of Eliot's &quot;Fragments/ shored against my ruin&quot;, and it not only looks and sounds fragmentary in its language, but the journey itself, unlike Eliot's does not find its final destination: a monumental fragment indeed. <br /><br />'Hevaev from Hell' is the parody of a parody, which makes it difficult to interpret. At its very heart is a set of footnotes, which are clearly introduced not to explain the plethora of references in one brief passage of the poem, neglecting the innumerable literary quotations that make up the very fabric of the poem, but to show how the heart of poetry and civilisation is broken, anti-aesthetic and referential. These footnotes could have been added at the end, instead they follow 'Orphalese', the centrepiece of the poem, breaking its very flow and beat. 'Heaven from Hell' clearly refers to 'The Waste Land', yet it also clearly refers to 'Paradise Lost'. However, despite being the illegitimate child of these two masterpieces, it never once directly quotes its parents. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1zZWN1cml0eS1zeXN0ZW0uY29tLw__" target="_blank">home security wireless camera</a>

Instead of showing the top ten results for the exact words you enter, in the trial Google suggests three related results that you might want to check out. Where does it display these suggestions? It shunts (or replaces) results 6, 7 and 8 !!! <br /><br />In this article, I refer to these results as 'intruders'. <br /><br />To see some 'intruder' results in action, search for &quot;piggy bank&quot;. Results 6, 7 and 8 are actually 'intruder' results; they're the top three results for the more specific, less popular search, &quot;piggy bank lyrics&quot;. Google assumes that people searching for &quot;piggy bank&quot; will probably be interested in results of a search for &quot;piggy bank lyrics&quot;. <br /><br />On first impressions, it's tempting to think that this makes it harder to get into the top ten (because now it's really the top seven, and the last two results may be easily overlooked). But it may actually make it easier - especially for smaller businesses. Let me explain why... <br /><br />The advantage for smaller businesses <br /><br />It all comes down to who can rank in the top ten for the most popular searches - like &quot;computers&quot;, &quot;cars&quot;, &quot;doctor&quot;, &quot;pets&quot;, etc. For anyone in these industries, a top ten ranking for these keywords is the holy grail. Unfortunately, these sorts of searches are presently dominated by big corporations with hefty search budgets. Most smaller businesses don't even try to compete. Instead of focusing on these hotly contested keywords, small businesses tend to focus on much more specific keyword phrases - like &quot;computers boston&quot;, &quot;second hand cars ohio&quot;, &quot;female doctor new england&quot;, &quot;discount pets for children&quot;, etc. <br /><br />But Google's trial may change that. Remember, it's replacing results 6, 7 and 8 of a popular, broad search with results 1, 2 and 3 of a less popular, more specific search. If the trial becomes a standard feature, a search for &quot;computers&quot; might well include three 'intruder' results from a search such as &quot;computers boston&quot;. As discussed above, results 6, 7 and 8 are likely to belong to big companies, whereas results 1, 2 and 3 of the more specific search are more likely to belong to smaller businesses. Therefore, when the switch occurs, it's out with the big and in with the small! <br /><br />In principle the enhancement appears to work in favor of small businesses: <br /><br />1) Big business dominates popular / general search results <br /><br />2) Smaller businesses have a greater chance of dominating less popular / more specific search results <br /><br />3) General search results are replaced by specific search results <br /><br />4) Big businesses are shunted out of the top ten by smaller businesses <br /><br />Now I hear what you're saying: &quot;Why wouldn't the big companies simply start optimizing for the more specific searches?&quot; Granted, this is a possibility; but for most big companies, it would be a monumental task. Big companies tend to service a large geographic region, and they typically offer numerous products and services. Even a hefty search budget would be stretched to the limit if it was required to bankroll optimization for every single product, every single service, and every single location. And this is what would be required to dominate all of the more specific results, thereby gaining back their number 6, 7 or 8 position. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1zZWN1cml0eS1zeXN0ZW0uY29tLw__" target="_blank">cheap security system</a>

Google assumes that most users who search for &quot;piggy bank&quot; will also be interested in results from a search for &quot;piggy bank lyrics&quot;. This assumption is based on the fact that thousands of other people are searching specifically for &quot;piggy bank lyrics&quot; - in fact, it's one of the most popular searches containing the original term &quot;piggy bank&quot;. And that's why it gets the nod. <br /><br />In other words, the intruder results come from popular searches (less popular than the original, but still popular). This means you'd already have to rank highly in a very popular search before you'd become an intruder. So, in reality, the above &quot;computer&quot; example is a little simplistic; the intruder results for &quot;computer&quot; are more likely to be from a search for something like &quot;computers ibm&quot;. In reality, the top three results for &quot;computer peripherals boston&quot; are more likely to appear as intruders in a &quot;computer peripherals&quot; search. <br /><br />Conclusion <br /><br />The important thing to remember is that if this trial becomes a standard feature, it will be implemented on all searches. And the more specific the original search, the easier it would be to become an intruder in that search. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jaGVhcC1zZWN1cml0eS1zeXN0ZW0uY29tLw__" target="_blank">cheap security system</a>

Is he suggesting that we all are illegitimate in some way? <br /><br />'Heaven from Hell' is a contradictory journey through Hades, the Underworld, Dante's Inferno and the dereliction of the human soul, however, unlike in Dante's 'Commedia', the Pilgrim here does not come out &quot;a riveder le stelle&quot;, to see the stars again like in the Italian poet's masterpiece: there is no resolution to the plight of humanity in the coming of a &quot;Greater Man&quot; like in 'Paradise Lost', no &quot;Datta&quot; no &quot;Dayadhvam&quot; and no &quot;Damyata&quot; like in Eliot's 'The Waste Land', therefore no relgious and philosophical solution to the soul's battering and anguish. <br /><br />This series of poems is contradictory from the beginning, it starts with a 'Letter to Charon' almost like a letter to Father Christmas, where the the deepest desires of the soul are set out, and the acknowledgement that Western Culture form Chaucer on has dried up: Whan in a sultry noon Of April We sweep the dust off The kerb oustide Uncle Hugh Selwyn's Empty brick house... - How to follow you Dear Charon, Down to the other side? <br /><br />Here two references, to Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' and to Ezra Pound 's Uncle Selwyn ecompass six centuries of Western civilisation and &quot;sweep&quot; them like dust on a journey where the infernal ferrier, synonymous with death, becomes &quot;Dear&quot;. <br /><br />The linguistic contradictions of the text are highlighted at the beginning of 'Orphalese', where the speaker shouts &quot;STOP speaking in glowing terms!&quot; yet goes on with almsot unintelligible language: it is as if the poem was conscious of its syntactic inconsistency, crying out against its own linguistic inability, yet is incapable of finding a solution to the incommunicable essence of life. <br /><br />Death is a clear theme, not only in terms of war imagery; the war imagery used in 'Heaven from Hell' is only expedient to the expression of the pain a dead soul, forced to roam the world of the living, encounters: the wars referred to in 'Heaven from Hell' are not the effort of conflicting armies, they are at the same time the Punic War and the Gulf War, yet even more precisely, they are the war of the human soul against its own destructiveness. <br /><br />Shakespere takes centre stage in 'Hevaen from Hell', of course with the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark and his lover Ophelia. Hamlet's suicidal thoughts permeate this piece and and human life, in a reversal of fortune, becomes an imitation of the theatre. Hamlet does not die in 'Heaven from Hell' yet Ophelia does, and while the hero attends her funeral, he shouts out, &quot;- Shit! This poem needs an epitaph!&quot; The poem is conscious of its aesthetic and literary existence, Ophelia receives her epitaph, yet Hamlet is left a dead soul in the world of the living who &quot;cannot drop&quot; the dramatic &quot;curtain&quot; over his own suffering. <br /><br />'Heaven from Hell' is a colossal attempt to come to terms with the poet/speaker's own mortality, with the demise of Westen culture and its illegitimacy: the metamyth presented is one of inhernet tragedy. It is a journey through Hell with no slution and no end, in fact, previous editions of the poem had the subtitle 'A fragment', so reminiscent of Eliot's &quot;Fragments/ shored against my ruin&quot;, and it not only looks and sounds fragmentary in its language, but the journey itself, unlike Eliot's does not find its final destination: a monumental fragment indeed. <br /><br />References <br /><br />Alighieri, D., 'Divina Commedia',1321. <br /><br />Bulla, A., 'Ybo?and Other Lies', 2005, Poetry Monthly Press. <br /><br />Bulla, A., 'Crosswords' in 'Autumn Leaves', Volume 13, Number 19, 2009. <br /><br />Chaucer, G.

At its very heart is a set of footnotes, which are clearly introduced not to explain the plethora of references in one brief passage of the poem, neglecting the innumerable literary quotations that make up the very fabric of the poem, but to show how the heart of poetry and civilisation is broken, anti-aesthetic and referential. These footnotes could have been added at the end, instead they follow 'Orphalese', the centrepiece of the poem, breaking its very flow and beat. 'Heaven from Hell' clearly refers to 'The Waste Land', yet it also clearly refers to 'Paradise Lost'. However, despite being the illegitimate child of these two masterpieces, it never once directly quotes its parents. The title is an indirect allusion to Milton's epic, its structure and footnotes tell us that its genetic mould is inherited from the Old Possum's 1922 poem, yet the poem itself does not dare to name its own cultural parents.

Dr M. Rossi analyses the power of imagery in his war poems, almost suggesting he is akin to Wilfred Owens, others have celebrated the delicacy of his erotic poetry or the lightness of feeling in his 'Flickers' and only T. Harrisson seems to have analysed 'Heaven from Hell' in some detail in his publication in 'Great Works'. <br /><br />Most references to 'Heaven from Hell' in fact are limited to pointing out its complexity, its parodic nature and its use of different languages, including Ancient Greek, Latin, Ancient Egyptian and French. It is now time to look at this collection in some detail, to try to understand its structure, myth and poetic impact. <br /><br />'Hevaev from Hell' is the parody of a parody, which makes it difficult to interpret. At its very heart is a set of footnotes, which are clearly introduced not to explain the plethora of references in one brief passage of the poem, neglecting the innumerable literary quotations that make up the very fabric of the poem, but to show how the heart of poetry and civilisation is broken, anti-aesthetic and referential. These footnotes could have been added at the end, instead they follow 'Orphalese', the centrepiece of the poem, breaking its very flow and beat. 'Heaven from Hell' clearly refers to 'The Waste Land', yet it also clearly refers to 'Paradise Lost'. However, despite being the illegitimate child of these two masterpieces, it never once directly quotes its parents. The title is an indirect allusion to Milton's epic, its structure and footnotes tell us that its genetic mould is inherited from the Old Possum's 1922 poem, yet the poem itself does not dare to name its own cultural parents. Is Bulla suggesting that Western culture has been disinherited? Is he suggesting that we all are illegitimate in some way? <br /><br />'Heaven from Hell' is a contradictory journey through Hades, the Underworld, Dante's Inferno and the dereliction of the human soul, however, unlike in Dante's 'Commedia', the Pilgrim here does not come out &quot;a riveder le stelle&quot;, to see the stars again like in the Italian poet's masterpiece: there is no resolution to the plight of humanity in the coming of a &quot;Greater Man&quot; like in 'Paradise Lost', no &quot;Datta&quot; no &quot;Dayadhvam&quot; and no &quot;Damyata&quot; like in Eliot's 'The Waste Land', therefore no relgious and philosophical solution to the soul's battering and anguish. <br /><br />This series of poems is contradictory from the beginning, it starts with a 'Letter to Charon' almost like a letter to Father Christmas, where the the deepest desires of the soul are set out, and the acknowledgement that Western Culture form Chaucer on has dried up: Whan in a sultry noon Of April We sweep the dust off The kerb oustide Uncle Hugh Selwyn's Empty brick house... - How to follow you Dear Charon, Down to the other side? <br /><br />Here two references, to Chaucer's 'Canterbury Tales' and to Ezra Pound 's Uncle Selwyn ecompass six centuries of Western civilisation and &quot;sweep&quot; them like dust on a journey where the infernal ferrier, synonymous with death, becomes &quot;Dear&quot;. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wbGF5c3RhdGlvbi0zLWJ1bmRsZXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">free kids video games</a>

It is a journey through Hell with no slution and no end, in fact, previous editions of the poem had the subtitle 'A fragment', so reminiscent of Eliot's &quot;Fragments/ shored against my ruin&quot;, and it not only looks and sounds fragmentary in its language, but the journey itself, unlike Eliot's does not find its final destination: a monumental fragment indeed. <br /><br />'Hevaev from Hell' is the parody of a parody, which makes it difficult to interpret.
