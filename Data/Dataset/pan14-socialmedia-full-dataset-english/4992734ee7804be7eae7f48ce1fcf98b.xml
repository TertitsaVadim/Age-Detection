Who could resist the temptation of looking graceful in a long formal dress with elegantly decorated skirt? While physical height makes a full-length formal dress an untouchable dream, there are many ways to have the right formal dresses make you an attractive girl regardless of your real stature.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_13379636_50643011.jpg" />
<br />Even if you are not tall enough to fit a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9sb25nLWZvcm1hbC1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">full-length formal dress</a>, you can just choose to wear a short formal dress that fits you. By revealing your lower legs or at least the ankles, a formal dress of proper length can shift others’ attention from your height to your overall figure that is no less pretty than tall girls. In order to make sure the dress will indeed give out such effects, you should first of all choose from the formal dresses that reach below to the knee or to the ankle at the most.  That is to say, do not let the formal dress fully cover the lower part of your body, otherwise, you will look even shorter worse-proportioned because the real figure shape is hidden and curves are weakened by boring cloth of the long skirt. In order to make your figure look better in the formal dress of the right length, a pair of well-chosen shoes without straps or other ankle-covering ornaments will also help highlight the charming parts of a petite girl.
<br /><br />In addition to length, the design of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9uZXctc3R5bGUteWVhci0xMi1mb3JtYWwtZHJlc3Nlcw__" target="_blank">12 year formal dress</a> is also critical to making others feel confused with your actual height. Many girls lacking confidence in their own shape just choose formal dresses loose enough to hide imperfect parts as well as the attractive parts. In fact there are much better ways to turn others’ eyes away from your imperfect parts of shape. High-waist design will give you a visually longer waist that adds to the visual height of your figure, and tight upper part with loose lower part or vice versa also helps exaggerate the better-looking part of your shape and lengthen the overall visual height. It should be noted that it is not necessary to just stick with one design that works for you once, since designs following similar principles will all be good choices for your formal dress.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_12098715_50643013.jpg" />
<br />Similarly to the design, the color of your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">formal dress</a> should neither just be in plain white or blue. Although contrasting colors in upper and lower parts must be avoided so as to save your visual height from looking “contracted” between the top and the bottom, mixed color patterns can still be used for more vivid appearance. The secret lies in the size of the patterns. While large-size patterns help tall girls gain eye-catching peculiarity, small or tiny colored patterns just make petite girls look sweeter and more appealing in their well-fitting formal dresses, because the contrast between the small patterns and the wearers’ overall figure is another trick to look taller than they virtually are.

It could be that the stain is irremovable, or that she has no time to get it cleaned up, or that the fabric of the dress requires special treatment which is not available to her. No matter what the reason is, she just has to put it on to attend the formal, because it is not worth it to give up the formal for just a stain on her dress. Surely, she will not just let the stain become what may cause her to be laughed at by others, and there are actually several simple but effective options for her to avoid embarrassment.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audressforformal.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fcache%2F1%2Fimage%2F441x%2F17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1%2Fa%2Fu%2Faudress-737002309.jpg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.audressforformal.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/441x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/a/u/audress-737002309.jpg</a>
<br />No doubt all methods to make the stain invisible are about covering it up, and what a girl can choose is what to be used as the cover. A brooch matching the design of her formal dress could be the best choice as it is available in various sizes and styles to not only hide the stain but also add glamour to her figure. A simple alternative to brooch is bowknot, which matches especially pretty well with cock-tail formal dresses. The wearer can also present others with her humanistic aspect by covering the stain with a support ribbon from a charity or non-profit organization. If she is certain that it is absolutely impossible to remove the stain, she can also choose to stich sequins or embroider flower patterns onto the stained part of the dress.
<br /><br />Choices mentioned above are good to stains on upper part of a <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">formal dress</a>, but what if the stain is in lower part, like the belly part or the skirt part? There are difficulties in dealing with such an annoying stain, but it is not completely impossible. Scarf or large shawl can be worn in a deliberate way so that a stain at anywhere from bust to upper belly can be covered beneath. When the stain is near the waistline, the wearer can make minor adjustment to her waistband to hide it. Wide ribbon belt of bright color in tune with the long formal dress will definitely beautify the formal dress while protecting wearer from revealing the imperfect part of hers dress.
<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.audressforformal.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fcache%2F1%2Fimage%2F441x%2F17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1%2Fa%2Fd%2Fad292.jpg"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.audressforformal.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/441x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/a/d/ad292.jpg</a>
<br />As to a stain that happens to appear on the skirt of a formal dress, smarter ideas are needed to deal with it. A stain near the bottom of skirt can be covered with a patch of the same color and fabric with the formal dress, since others could hardly find out what is different with that part that is swinging all the time when the wearer is moving. To make the patch more invisible, the thread used to stich it onto the skirt should also be in the same color.
<br /><br />Now what remains is how to cover a stain on the part of skirt that everyone can see clearly. It may look weird with a pin flower or a patch at that part, so a slightly bigger alteration is necessary. It should be worth a try to add some furrows to the skirt so that the stain would be folded into invisible part of a furrow; or vine-shaped string-like decorative stuff could be pinned to wind from waist or even shoulders down to the bottom of skirt passing over the stained part. And if professional help is available, adding a tulle outskirt could also be a good choice to make the stain out of the vision of other attenders at the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9uZXctc3R5bGUteWVhci0xMi1mb3JtYWwtZHJlc3Nlcw__" target="_blank">year 12 formal</a>.

Unlike casual clothes, a formal dress is designed for nice look more than for convenience. All what designers thought about was how to make the formal dresses as gorgeous as possible, while it is always out of their mind how to make sure the dress will stay on the wearer’s body as it stays on a mannequin no matter what kind of action she is making.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_8067252_49158000.jpg" />
<br />You probably used to wonder how those star ladies managed to always stay safe from embarrassment in those gorgeous formal dresses that seem to be ready for slipping from where they were anytime. Could it be that they made it by moving with extreme caution? Well, no matter how careful you are with your movements, you could be one hundred percent sure that unexpected embarrassing things would not happen. The absolute safety could only come from pre-event preparation, such as fashion tapes.
<br /><br />Fashion tape is the unseen secret of every lady in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">formal dress</a>. If you simply try to figure out how other ladies managed to hold every part of their formal dresses where it should be in dance and movement by simply looking from the outside, you will never learn the real skill. Some people may be able to think up the idea of making the formal dress stick to body firmly with tapes, but they still need to do some research about what kind of tapes should be used for that purpose. Fashion tapes are not ordinary tapes and they are designed specifically for people to hold dresses. They are made from materials that do not harm human skin and the stickiness is just enough to hold cloth to skin but is not so much that it will hurt your skin or damage dress to rip off the tapes. In addition, fashion tapes also have various shapes so that they could fit different parts of a formal dress to fulfill the purpose of hold dress parts without revealing themselves.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_9814277_49004148.jpg" />
<br />Fashion tape works much like double-sided adhesive tape. Before you use it, you have to make sure the skin of the body part where the tape will be used is clean and dry, so that the tape’s stickiness will not be reduced. Then you put on the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9uZXctc3R5bGUteWVhci0xMi1mb3JtYWwtZHJlc3Nlcw__" target="_blank">year 12 formal dress</a> and arrange every parts properly to make it just what you want to look like. Make some big sweeping gestures to figure out which parts tend to slip down. Peel one side of a tape and stick it to one of the slipping parts. Make sure the tape sticks well to the dress before you peel the other side and press it onto the corresponding body part. You may need to make some adjustments so that where cover is needed is covered well and no extra revealing is caused.
<br /><br />Fashion tapes can not only be used to avoid embarrassment at the event where you expect to be perfectly graceful, but it can also be used when the size of the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9sb25nLWZvcm1hbC1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">long formal dress</a> is a bit larger for you. Sometimes the actual size of your body just does not fall exactly in any size of the ready-to-wear formal dress, so you have to compromise by picking one piece that is of the size close to yours. To wear such a formal dress, fashion tapes will be very useful for you to make minor adjustment so that every part of the dress will just fit as if the dress was specially made for you.

Here I have chosen a few amazing green color formal for women. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_1892963_50761076.jpg" />
<br />Strapless <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9jaGlmZm9uLWZvcm1hbC1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">chiffon formal dresses</a> could be a trendy and they are pleasing on some fairy and mellow materials. There is no official history of formal dresses, so the meaning given by different people may differ from other. 
<br /><br />Light and bright colors are definitely perfect for young girls, like peach-pink, coral and aqua-blue. They can totally bring out the sweetness and youth of young girls. Lace may be the dreamy dress for some girls. Of course, you can ask for another accessories to give some astonishing look, such as the cute handbags and cute necklace. Besides buying the formal dresses, never forget to decide on the hair you do. 
<br /><br />If you want to obtain this, you need know that it is important you know exactly your own perfect measurement, with the parts with the waist, hips and bust. It is really important finding the most flattering. But <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9ncmVlbi1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">green formal dresses</a> can give quite a cool look.

<br />And, if you desire to be daring and bold, you can try brighter colors for your formal dresses, for example, fuchsia or purple one. They are both trendy this summer. You’d better stay away from the formal dresses which would make your most beautiful features highlighted. It’s right to choose cocktail dresses, and perfect with good support plus a nice neckline. 
<br /><br />The trend for green formal dresses is quite popular in many countries, like the USA, Britain, Australia, and Canada and so on. Also, it’s not wrong for you to select the one shoulder with the low style. 
<br /><br />There is another consideration, that is the price. There are two possible choices for you, conventional purchasing and online purchases. If you are looking for some cheap formal dresses, make sure the one you choose is in stock. You would not like to run the chance of having to put on not the proper outfit. 
<br /><br />It is not very easy to know what formal dresses would make you look gorgeous, because there are rather too many styles including long or short strapless patterns available. However,by looking through magazines and stores, department ones or online ones, you could easily decide on what styles you are interested in. You could find bold patterns among stripes and floral print, with green color and pinafores, and you should never miss prairie look new wave, and empire waist baby-doll dresses.

With regards to the event, the skirt can be full or maybe more form fitting. At more formal events, women should wear full skirts, especially occasionally with honored guests such as heads of state. The sleeves of your ball gown usually are short, as well as the dress will often have a flattering neckline that may also be used to showcase elegant jewelry. Less formal evening gowns include cocktail dresses, which are shorter plus more form fitting, and dancing dresses for example <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9sb25nLWZvcm1hbC1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">long formal dresses</a>.
<br /><br />Ball gowns have a tendency to use luxury materials including silk, velvet, and taffeta, plus they may be richly embroidered or decorated with beads, sequins, jewels, as well as other ornaments. Wealthy women also would rather purchase tailored evening gowns, which are built to flatter their figures. In all cases, evening gowns are designed to be worn with high quality jewelry.
<br /><br />Needless to say, no one may wish to waste her cash on selecting an inappropriate dress therefore it is better to find out about your body type prior to buying your ball gown. First of all you must know about your system type. Know of the trouble spots inside you. You need to know that which a part of the body has body fat and what part ought to be focused and enhanced more. If you have heard bout the body type then you must choose the designs based on that. Color creates a strong and effective effect on the body. Dark colors like deep blue, purple, emerald green allow you to look slim and taller so if you feel short and stout apply for such colors. In the same way, light colors like beige, gold and grey make you look shorter. So, tall women can wear such colors to balance their height.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_4960151_48928765.jpg" />
<br />Summer collection ball gown silhouetted corset fitting dress is adorned with elaborate embellishments. Cute white bows increase the elegance of bridesmiad gowns in twin colors and bridesmaid dresses with detachable spaghetti straps will be in the newest fashion. Material is also a great source to enhance your figure. If you have got heavy body then you must select soft and light fabric like silks and chiffon. Net creates elegance and classy look.
<br /><br />After using your dress there are two recommended means of storing your ball gown. One is to fold it carefully in tissue paper and store it in the box with some cedar balls and/or a couple of fabric softener sheets. Otherwise you can fold it more than a hanger in the waist (back side on the hanger) and put it in a very garment bag.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_6520250_48928772.jpg" />
<br />Remember, this is a long, heavy dress. Hanging it by the shoulders or straps could cause stretching with the straps or even the fabric in the shoulders. You can also hang it from the straps and ribbons then drape the rest of the dress over another hanger-at concerning the knees. This can also prevent stretching. Personally, I take no chances. I fold my all dresses.More Information you can check <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Audressforformal</a>.

<br />Women wear a variety of dresses. See formal gowns, evening gowns, and wedding dresses. Business attire for women had a developmental history of its own and generally looks different than formal dress for social occasions. Although a ball gown is most appropriate, the strict requirements have relaxed somewhat, and a floor-length evening dress is often acceptable. Cocktail or tea-length dresses are really not suitable. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9sb25nLWZvcm1hbC1kcmVzc2Vz" target="_blank">Long formal dresses</a> is the best choice.

Outside of this one requirement, women may choose to wear any color they prefer and make use of a wide range of styles and materials for the attire. The options may include something more daring, such as a full-length dress with spaghetti straps and back or side slits that reveal a bit of leg. Depending on the exact nature of the event, something more conservative may be required, such as a simple full-length skirt accentuated by a silk blouse and simple jewelry that calls attention to the overall elegance of the lady. More understanding of short prom dresses also comes in magazines like Seventeen. Online stores abound with their collection offerings of destination wedding gown that even allow a web-based design feature to go with the online purchase.

There are those who claim the scalloped trip necklines of the Renaissance age in Italy were the first true sweetheart necklines. Others credit 18th century French designers with creating the attractive contours of the design. A third school of thought places the first sweetheart neckline as appearing in the court of Isabella in 15th century Spain. Whatever the origins, the design has made a powerful impact on ladies' formal wear for quite a long time.

<br /><br />A corset is a type of undergarment that serves to support the bust and define the waistline. It is most often worn by women, but sometimes by men as well. Corsets may be worn to support the spine for medical reasons or to create a certain shape for aesthetic purposes. The corset was commonly worn by women in the Western world until the use of bras became more widespread in the 1920s and 1930s.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_8067252_49158000.jpg" />
<br />Corsets vary widely in their design as well as their purpose. Most are made of fabric, leather, or another flexible material and enforced with hard strips called boning. In the Victorian period, boning was usually whalebone, although steel was also used. Today, many corsets use plastic boning for a more lightweight feel. A corset typically laces up in the back in order to adjust the fit, although some models lace in the front. Some back-laced models also feature buttons or hooks on the front.
<br /><br />While the practice of wearing a corset, particularly during the Victorian era, often gets a bad rap, it is not harmful or uncomfortable if done correctly. Some wearers did and do take the corset to an extreme in a practice known as tightlacing, in which the waist may be reduced to around 15 inches (38 cm), and some have had ribs removed in order to create a smaller waist. However, such extremes are not widespread, and corsets do not typically create health problems or inhibit the wearer's physical activity if worn properly. When wearing a traditional corset, it is important to have it custom fitted in order to avoid health risks.

Smaller budget can even make purchase more exciting, because we will start to look for good things of lower prices than we previously expected. Get fed up with old evening dresses in the cabinet? Just buy a new one online. Do not worry — you can make it within budget. Presuming that most of us acknowledge the convenience of purchasing online, here are a few tips on how to get a satisfying new evening dress from an online dress store within a much smaller budget than before. 
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_12878794_49181855.jpg" />
<br /><br />The first thing to do is obviously to find out the right store. Many people only go to brand name stores, but if we search for &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">formal dresses</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hdWRyZXNzZm9yZm9ybWFsLmNvbS9ldmVuaW5nLWRyZXNzZXM_" target="_blank">cheap evening dresses</a>&quot; in Google, we can find that there are tens of thousands of online stores selling all kinds of evening dresses at much lower prices than brand name stores. The tip is to choose those can be found on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, as good stores are always willing to communicate with their customers through every possible social media network. Online support system and free customer service line are also important things, because that will be the major means customers can reach the stores. If you are not sure about anything, try first to get through the service number to make sure the service is always available when you are in need. If you have no idea on what to ask for the first call, you may just try to figure out how fast they can deliver the dresses. If the store has warehouse located in your country, 24-48 hours are good; and if not, one week should be reasonable. In fact, in order to compete with those brand name stores, these non-brand-name stores are always quick in responding and deliver every order as fast as they so that customers will trust them for more purchases.
<br /><br />Since a good store is chosen, the next thing is to choose from the various exhibiting dress images. Images are always illusive, but prices are reliable. Why these non-brand-name stores claim that they sell the cheapest evening dresses? The answer is they offer dresses of different price ranges. The most expensive products are possibly in the &quot;over $500&quot; group, and the cheapest ones may be placed in the &quot;under $100&quot; range. As a result, customers can always find something they like very much yet within their budget. Even the “high-class” evening dresses are still much cheaper than similar ones being sold in brand name stores. Well, not every dress designer can get high pay and considerable fame and have their designs being sold in big stores at decent prices.
<br /><img src="http://www.pan.net/en/p/oo/182451649_3394009_49181859.jpg" />
<br />Attention: do not get over-excited for the low prices and overlook details. You should never hesitate to bother the online service persons for everything you care about – from size to product material, from whether the dress matches your shoes to what kind of extra accessories you can get, and even whether discount is available for your next purchase or referring friends. It can be expected that all of your reasonable demands will be met as long as the store believes that they get a returning customer.
