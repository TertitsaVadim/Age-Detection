<br />Well...Without him, im nothing, life wouldnt be worth living if i didnt have him with me.
<br />He's amazing and although i get a little jealous of his 'Crush', Ill get over it.
<br />Because i love him so much, amd he makes my day.
<br />he makes me laugh like a little kid and he ha made me what I am today.
<br />I need him so much. Just knowing i get to talk to him every day makes me work that little faster to get home to talk with him. Whatever he says, it makes me smile... Like how he calls me a super dork 
<br />and how he laughed when i told him im scared of butterflies ¬____¬
<br />And i love how he gives me butterflies everytime he says 'i love you'.
<br />He is that feeling you get when you hold hands for the first time...and share that special moment.
<br />Logan IS my life, He IS my baby and i cant stand being without him.
<br />Im sorry for every time i ever hurt him, or made him cry.
<br />Logan, your perfect, and i love you
<br /><br />----this was written by Jake.....SuperDorkFerSure..... isnt it SO SWEET?????!!!!?!?!??!

<br />Blood drips away
<br />My body aches
<br />As night vanquishes day
<br /><br />Night black as coal
<br />I can not see
<br />I hear you laugh
<br />You’re here to kill me
<br /><br />“I have done nothing wrong!”
<br />Your hands are cold against my skin
<br />“No, you’re innocent. That’s the best.
<br />Of course you’ve done nothing wrong; no sin.”
<br /><br />My chained wrists bleed
<br />He licks the blood away
<br />“Why am I here? Please!”
<br />“I’ll make you stay.”
<br /><br />I shudder and cry out in pain
<br />As he only holds my waist
<br />He can hear my heartbeat
<br />Thud thud, it’s in a race
<br /><br />Something pierces my skin
<br />It’s a new feeling
<br />I tried to call out for help
<br />But I only moan, reeling
<br /><br />He lets me go
<br />My body weak
<br />I try to grasp his hand
<br />No words to speak
<br /><br />His hand runs though my hair
<br />“Now your mine, my love
<br />No need to cry out for help
<br />No need for help above.”
<br /><br />Years pass
<br />Blood is shed
<br />My eyes are burnt fire
<br />As I had fed
<br /><br />A life unknown
<br />A love unbound
<br />A new sight
<br />Complete is found
<br /><br />I found the one
<br />To turn his world around
<br />I take his everything
<br />My love I’ve found
<br /><br />“I’ll take good care of you
<br />No need to worry
<br />I’ll help you
<br />Don't feel sorry
<br /><br />But No need to cry
<br />No need to pout
<br />Like mine, your life will become
<br />A dreamless blackout.”

<br />Closer with every word
<br />With words lingering
<br />With everything they heard
<br /><br />Their love was flawless
<br />Love that was true
<br />A smile and a tear
<br />With every ‘I love you’
<br /><br />One day in a crowd
<br />Everyone went crazy
<br />A war had begun
<br />In a fog; very hazy
<br /><br />Their hands held tight
<br />To one another
<br />For if they become separate
<br />They will be lost forever
<br /><br />His side and hers are opposite
<br />They pull the two away
<br />Their hands let go
<br />No longer together to stay
<br /><br />Her family hates him
<br />As his do her family
<br />Tears fall from each others eyes
<br />No longer to be together in harmony
<br /><br />He goes to his room
<br />And clings to her only memory
<br />A picture of her smiling
<br />For dear life, he was clinging
<br /><br />A glock he possesses
<br />Pointed to his temple, he cries
<br />“My love, never forget me.”
<br />Click, boom, he dies
<br /><br />His family rushes to the room
<br />Where he lay upon his bed
<br />Still holding to her picture
<br />While there’s a hole in his head
<br /><br />The news ran wild
<br />Finally reaching her
<br />Tears held no longer
<br />Feelings no longer astir
<br /><br />To her room
<br />She wallows
<br />In her last memory
<br />That will always follow
<br /><br />Her last memory
<br />Of him holding his girl
<br />Whispering in her hear
<br />“You are my whole world.”
<br /><br />She cries helplessly
<br />Clinging for dear life
<br />“Never forget me.” She whispers
<br />Grabbing for her knife
<br /><br />Holding it above her head
<br />The knife plunges her heart
<br />She hits the ground
<br />Pain escaping at the start
<br /><br />Her family screams and shudders
<br />At the messy sight
<br />Blood is everywhere; death
<br />Moonlight comes from the window; secret night
<br /><br />The two families drove
<br />The lovers to their death
<br />Separating them because of war
<br />Drawing their last memorial breath
<br /><br />Together they lay under the willow
<br />Encrypted on the stones, ‘Never Forget Me.’
<br />In the end, together they are
<br />Holding hands by the pearly sea.

<br />And wake my dreams
<br />Let the lighting strike
<br />Away all my screams
<br /><br />Let my tears run down
<br />My face
<br />Please hold my body close
<br />Comforting embrace
<br /><br />Don't let go
<br />Don't let the rain wash me away
<br />Please hold me
<br />I’m here to stay
<br /><br />I’m scared
<br />The thunder rolls
<br />Lighting flashes
<br />Fear uncoils
<br /><br />Tell me it’s alright
<br />Tell me you’re here
<br />Wipe away my tears
<br />Help me with my fear
<br /><br />Say you’ll be there
<br />Forever in my dreams
<br />Raining on my heart
<br />Washing away my screams
<br /><br />Keep the fire within
<br />Down; not to burn
<br />Keep the lightning away
<br />A lesson to learn
<br /><br />Hold my thunder
<br />Keep it at ease
<br />Keep me from trembling
<br />Kiss me, Please?
<br /><br />You’re my everything
<br />Rain, lighting, and thunder
<br />I love you, baby
<br />You hold my strength, my hunger
<br /><br />As time goes on
<br />My Storm passes by
<br />I will eternally love you
<br />I promise, until the day I die.

<br />Hell he aspires
<br />Because he lives
<br />Lives in the fire
<br /><br />Fine in the core
<br />Fire in our eyes
<br />As the blood drips 
<br />Slowly it dries
<br /><br />Warmth of burning
<br />Turning to and angle
<br />You will see
<br />The Fire Angel
<br /><br />He cries at night
<br />For love he can not hold
<br />Against his will
<br />His soul was sold
<br /><br />He walks among us
<br />You will never know 
<br />As he speaks a trance
<br />Friend or foe?
<br /><br />Lover as he
<br />But his love is cold
<br />But only for I
<br />His love I hold
<br /><br />As he lays in my bed
<br />Not a flame will occur
<br />For in love, he is mortal
<br />I smile as he stirs
<br /><br />My hands run over
<br />His alabaster skin
<br />The fire within him shakes
<br />For the Fire Angel is my unashamed sin
<br /><br />His love is sweet 
<br />Full of perfectness
<br />He says he’s full of
<br />Complete nothingness
<br /><br />As he holds me tight
<br />He cries in his sleep
<br />He wants to be mortal
<br />His love is deep
<br /><br />“I love you, my dear
<br />Please say it back?
<br />The only thing is
<br />A life I lack.”
<br /><br />He speaks with love
<br />That’s deep within
<br />He hides in my arms
<br />Form the harm of men
<br /><br />His naked body
<br />Lies very still
<br />He sweats in pain
<br />Pain I can feel
<br /><br />They come with knives
<br />Chainsaws and guns
<br />The Fire Angel awakes
<br />Never to run
<br /><br />They come to kill 
<br />For the lives he’s taken
<br />He kills to survive himself
<br />His life, someone else was holdin’ 
<br /><br />Here they come
<br />Knocking down my door
<br />The Fire Angel stiffens
<br />I scream and hide on the floor
<br /><br />The Fir angel screams
<br />The fight was lost
<br />The men laugh at the death
<br />The room fell with a cold frost
<br /><br />My Fire Angel love
<br />His soul is within me
<br />Look into my red eyes
<br />His life you will see
<br /><br />I kill them all
<br />With a prick of the finger
<br />My Fire Angles aura
<br />Is being to linger
<br /><br />With all my might
<br />I try to bring him back
<br />For now we both are immortal
<br />A love we shall never lack

<br />listen to it
<br />listen and hear
<br />wind of love
<br />nothing to fear
<br /><br />carrying the troubles
<br />that life beholds
<br />when everything cripples
<br />and crashes in the folds
<br /><br />wind upon my face
<br />very gentle
<br />swaying back and forth
<br />over a tree tops temple
<br /><br />look and see
<br />the lies
<br />that are laid upon
<br />all the desperate cries
<br /><br />cries of wisdom and help
<br />tears of pain
<br />blowing up inside
<br />crazy; insane
<br /><br />a balloon
<br />carried upon the sky
<br />wind drifting it away
<br />way way up high
<br /><br />catch it between
<br />your dainty fingers
<br />the wind will
<br />never quench your hunger
<br /><br />it carries away
<br />all the changes of season
<br />winter, spring, summer, fall
<br />all for good reason
<br /><br />winter brings cold
<br />bitter winds
<br />icy roads and heart
<br />you break if you bend
<br /><br />spring gives new life
<br />trees and grass all green
<br />colors of a rainbow
<br />all will be seen
<br /><br />summer is hot
<br />dry and crisp
<br />hurting more
<br />with every hit
<br /><br />fall brings forht
<br />the imagination
<br />with all the colors
<br />no hesitation
<br /><br />wind takes the leave
<br />blows the snow
<br />brings everything
<br />of all you know
<br /><br />death like
<br />very still
<br />listen and hear
<br />the wind upon your window sill
