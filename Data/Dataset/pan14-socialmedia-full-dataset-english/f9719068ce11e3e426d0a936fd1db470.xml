<br /><br />“But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.  People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—having a form of godliness but denying its power.  Have nothing to do with them.”
<br />         2nd Timothy 3:1-4
<br /><br />Does this sound like the generation we live in today?  Almost all of us can identify with people who fit any or all of these categories.  The Bible prophecy is being fulfilled as we speak and all indications are that these are the last days.  What do we do to get ready for the return of Jesus?  Are we prepared for his return, and do we know how God is going to judge us?  There are only two choices that we can make, either to be ready to live with God in heaven, or to follow Satan into his lake of everlasting fire called Hell.  Getting ready for the return of Jesus can be like making and confirming our reservations to go on the last trip we will ever make.  This trip will take us to the place where we will spend all eternity.  The place we are going to is either going to be the grandest, most beautiful, joyful and magnificent place we can imagine, or it is going to be a place where we will suffer in Satan’s lake of fire for all eternity.  Each one of us now has this option and can confirm and make our reservation to Heaven or Hell, as there is no other option available, and no one can make this reservation for us.   I would encourage each of you today to please confirm your reservation now by accepting Jesus as your Savior.  Ask him to come into your heart, and forgive you of your sins, and promise that you will serve him for the rest of your life.  This simple commitment will confirm your reservation into God’s Kingdom.

<br /><br />“Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing me in the desert, where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.”
<br />        Hebrews 3:8-9
<br /><br />These are the words that God gives us to warn us to not harden our hearts and obey his teachings.  But I am afraid that our society as a whole is again hardening their hearts to the Word of God and his commandments.  We are turning away from God and becoming a world where there is sexual immorality, perversion, greed, anger, and almost any other form of sin pervading our society.  We are gradually taking God out of our lives, as he is becoming less and less of our daily lives.  I can remember as I grew up that we prayed in school, and any government meeting was begun with prayer.  Our families prayed before meals and we worshipped together at church on Sunday.  Today, we are not allowed to pray in school, or in our government.  There is becoming more and more families that do not pray together, and many do not even go to church to worship.  God warns us to not test him in these acts of disobedience, as throughout history he has turned his back on his people when they began turning from him.  In the scripture above he let his chosen people wander for forty years in the desert because they hardened their hearts toward him.  Our society is forgetting God, and I believe he is again going to punish us for this disobedience.  God’s chosen people have been the most powerful people in existence when they have obeyed and followed God’s commands, but when they disobeyed, God has allowed them to be defeated, conquered and humiliated by their enemies. I would encourage each of you to open your hearts to God and change your lives, before God takes his revenge on you.

<br /><br />“Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.  Instead it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.”
<br />       1st Peter 3:3-4
<br /><br />So often throughout our society our success in life is judged by our outward appearance.  Recent surveys show that someone who is attractive has a much better chance of getting the best jobs, receive better raises and has a much better chance to advance in their careers.  Our society routinely promotes outward appearances through beauty pageants, fashions and television and movie stars as the ultimate pinnacle of success.  However, it is not the outward appearances that matters most to God, as it is the inner beauty of each of us that is important to Him.  I recently saw a young girl who was deformed and crippled from birth with a terrible disease.  Her limbs and face were distorted, but God had given her a talent for music, and she had been asked to play the piano for one of the largest symphonies in the nation.  Her music was the best I have ever heard. Her beauty did not come from her outward appearance, but rather came from her inner self, and God had given her a gift that very few people have.  It is important to never judge others based on what we see with our eyes, but to judge them on their hearts, and even then we are not the final judge as what we think does not matter.  God is the ultimate judge for all of us, as it is when we stand before God on judgment day, we will not be judged on our beauty, as God will look at our hearts, at our good deeds, at the way we lived our lives and obeyed His commands.  All of these things will be considered, but the most important thing of all is that we have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior.

<br /><br />“Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.  But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.”
<br />       1st Peter 4:12-13
<br /><br />It is sometimes difficult to understand why things happen to us.  Why do we have the trials and troubles that we suffer through, when we are trying our best to be a Christian?  Many times it seems like we are constantly deep in the valleys and the mountains seem too steep to climb, and there is no way that we can see how we will ever overcome our problems.  I have a dear Christian friend who this scripture fits so well, as during the past year he endured a terrible year financially, as one problem after another happened in his business.   He had given so much of himself during this time both financially and of his time, to help distribute food to the needy in our area, while his own personal finances had suffered.  I recently had a conversation with him and asked him why he had continued to give the way he did, when he was suffering so badly himself.  He stated that the time that he spent distributing the food to the needy was what was getting him through his own troubles.  He said that he looked forward to the days that the food was distributed, and that this was his best day of the week.  His faith and trust in God has never wavered during the year, and he faithfully kept giving of his time and money.  The people in our church have seen his unwavering dedication to God during this difficult time, and it is touching many of the people around him.  He is a tremendous witness for Christ wherever he goes, and through his trials he continues to keep his faith and trust.  I would encourage each of you to continue trusting in God even during your trials because your reward in heaven will be worth it.

<br /><br />“Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you.  I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.”
<br />        Isaiah 46:4
<br /><br />Last week I saw the news where severe flooding in Texas had claimed the lives of several people.  The newscast showed several people clinging to the tops of trees to try to escape the raging waters.  In life there are times when we are going along without a care in the world and nothing to weigh us down.  Then, without warning we are hit by a catastrophe such as this flood and our world is turned upside down.  We look around and are terrified by what we see, as our human eyes do not see any way out of our trouble.  I am sure that these people clinging to the tree tops felt exactly this way, and felt that their worlds had collapsed around them.  Their homes, their material possessions and everything they owned had been swept away by the raging floodwaters.  In the scripture above God tells us that there is hope in the worst of times as He will sustain us and rescue us.  Maybe you are facing adversity in a physical, emotional, or financial area of your life.  Don’t panic! Pray, even though it looks like there is no way out, you must not lose heart because God is still there, and knows your trouble, and tells us that He will not let us bear more than we can handle.  Isaiah 43:2 “I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.  When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.”  I would encourage each of you to turn to God when you face your troubles, as He will be there to listen and come to your rescue.  There is no one that can conquer the raging floods in your life the way God can.  Even through our trials God can give us His overwhelming peace and assurances that everything is fine.

<br /><br />“This day is sacred to our Lord.  Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”
<br />        Nehemiah 8:10
<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how easy our joy can disappear?  We can wake up in the morning with joy in our hearts and a smile on our face, but the first disappointment or problem we face, completely destroys that joy, and takes away that smile.  It is so easy to allow Satan to destroy our joy and our positive attitude, and replace it with discouragement and negativity.  I believe that each day is sacred and precious to God, and He wants us to cherish it as much as possible.  God wants us to be at peace and have joy in our lives, as we are going to be a better witness for Him, and be more focused on His will, when we are happy.  When we begin to give in to discouragement, to have doubts, to concentrate on the negative things around us, we are on the path to losing our joy and happiness.  The answer to getting back our joy and happiness, is to begin to refocus our minds and life back on God, as chances are when your joy and happiness began leaving you, was the time you were drifting away from God.  I would suggest that when you sense that your joy is waning, to begin immediately praying to God.  Thank Him for all the blessings that He has bestowed on you, for providing you with your needs, and saving your soul.  Think about King David, as he prayed to God constantly, when his joy began to leave him, as much of the Book of Psalm was about him, either thanking God for blessing him, or praying for deliverance from his enemies.   I would encourage you that when that black cloud threatens to take over, to seek God, and remember that you serve a good and gracious God, one who loves you unconditionally, and wants you to be joyful, so that He can fulfill the plan and purpose that He has for your life.

<br /><br />“I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”
<br />          Matthew 5:18
<br /><br />The above scripture describes how Jesus felt about the law, and the importance it meant to him.  I have heard many people say that the Law of the Old Testament was not meant for Jesus’ time, or was meant for the society we live in.  This is not true, as throughout the New Testament, both Jesus and the Disciples talk repeatedly, about the Law and the importance it means.  The Law that is depicted in the Old Testament is still the Law that God expects us to obey today.  When I think back to the time of my childhood, and see the changes in family values that have occurred during this time, I realize what perilous times we are living in.  The lifestyles of today’s families bear little resemblance to what they were, as I was growing up.  Families have compromised their values little by little, until they have succumbed to the temptations of Satan, and have thrown God out of their families.  The divorce rates are skyrocketing, and families are being torn apart by drug and alcohol abuse, sexual permissiveness, relationship and financial pressures.  The home is no longer a place for children to feel safe and secure, and a place where Godly principles are taught.  Children are left to find their own values, usually from their peers, who have not been taught the word of God, and what is right from wrong.  When God gave us the Law, it was meant to provide guidance and wisdom for all people to use, as it gives us the format to pattern our families and our lives after.  I would encourage each of you to study God’s word, and apply it to your life and your family.  It will make a difference in your life.

<br /><br />“But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret.  Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”
<br />         Matthew 6:3-4
<br /><br />During this past ten years I have been amazed at the lack of commitment that our church community has shown to provide for the needy in our community.  I have visited the majority of the churches in our area speaking to their congregations about the need in our area and the number of people who are going hungry.  The majority of these churches have not responded to this need, and have not participated in any way.  Many of the churches that have responded have done so with the idea of getting publicity for their churches, and unless there has been a way to get their name in the public eye they have not contributed.  The scripture above tells us how Jesus views our giving to the needy, as it needs to be done in private and not with the thought of bringing attention to ourselves.  I know that my wife and I have provided help to the needy throughout the years, always keeping our giving between the person we are helping and ourselves, as God tells us to do.  There was a wealthy gentleman in our area several years ago who would give large sums of money to worthwhile causes, but always insisted on the building being named after him or his name displayed in a public place.  His sole purpose was to let others know that he gave and to get public recognition for his gift.  I believe that giving in this manner did nothing to bring him any reward in the sight of God, as he was doing it not with the idea of helping others, but to gain glory for himself in the eyes of others.  God wants each of us to give freely, as He has provided our needs and wants us to then give freely of our excess.

<br /><br />“Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.  She said to herself, ‘if I only touch his cloak, I will be healed’.  Jesus turned and saw her.  ‘Take heart, daughter’, he said, ‘your faith has healed you.”
<br />        Matthew 9:20-21
<br /><br />Jesus tells us in His scriptures that if we have as little faith as a mustard seed we can make a mountain move.  This woman in the scripture above proved Her faith just by touching the hem of Jesus’ garment and was healed.  Jesus also healed two blind men. Matthew 9:28-29 “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” “Yes, Lord” they replied.  Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith will it be done to you”; and their sight was restored.” There are so many people suffering with medical issues, financial issues, relationship issues and family issues today that could be healed, if they just had enough faith, as in the two examples above.  As Christians we go to church each Sunday, and read our Bibles each day, and know what God tells us about the power of our faith.  God tells us that our faith can heal and restore, so why don’t we have enough faith to cure ourselves of our sickness?  I have personally witnessed several people during the past two years that have been healed, and had the faith necessary to have God touch them, and heal their bodies.  To be able to witness a healing by faith is such an important occurrence, in that it lets us know that the power of God’s word is still alive in our nation today.  God is still with us, and His power is still as strong and alive as it was in the days of the Apostles.  I would encourage each of you that have a medical need, to seek God, spend time with Him and get to know Him in such a way as to have the faith needed to ask for your own healing, as in the examples above.

<br /><br />“Show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths; guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.”
<br />       Psalm 25:4-5
<br /><br />Recently I was given directions to get to a board meeting in a nearby town.  I had written down, what I thought were detailed directions to the restaurant.  It was in an area that I thought I was familiar enough with that I would not have any problems.  However I had missed a key part of the directions as I found myself going completely through the town without seeing the restaurant.  I retraced my steps and again found that it did not lead me to where I wanted to go.  Finally, in desperation I called and found the right direction and got to the meeting on time.  The problem had been that the person giving me the direction was doing so by looking at coming into town from the west, but I was looking at coming into town from the east.  So when he said to turn right I should have been turning left.  Both of us had completely misunderstood the other.  Our daily lives can also be confusing as well, but God gives us directions through our daily reading of the Bible, praying and then listening to what it really says can keep us going in the right direction.  When we turn to God for our directions he has the answers and will lead us to our correct destination.  There are many decisions that each of us have to make in our daily lives such as financial decisions, relationship decisions, health decisions and family decisions.  Most of these decisions are ones that many times we need help with to make the best decision possible.  God can help and assist us and give us the right advice and direction to follow, if we will only call upon Him.  I would encourage each of you to call upon God as he will show you His ways and teach you His paths and guide you in His truth.

<br /><br />“The Lord is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made.”
<br />Psalm 145:13
<br /><br />Sometimes we don’t understand just how faithful God is to provide for us in the way He does. He tells us that He will provide all our needs, but so often we want much more than our needs to be met. I am reminded of the Book of Job where chapter after chapter finds Job saying, “God, I don’t understand why these things are happening.” God’s response is, “you don’t need to know why; you just need to know Me.” This is the way that most people are today, as we seldom understand the wisdom of God, and question why we are not all blessed with riches and everything we ask for. We question why we are given our crosses to bear, such as our health issues, our financial issues, and the all so often relationship issues with friends and even our families. Why do we have to struggle with everything, and why doesn’t things come easy for us? With all of these questions facing us, and very few answers, it is easy to get frustrated and simply quit trying to understand. But God tells us that He is faithful, and will provide for us and will fulfill all His promises. When the Israelites left Egypt they did not understand where they were going to get food in the desert, but God provided manna from heaven. They did not know how they would cross the Red Sea, but God parted the waters for them to pass through. Whatever our needs are God is faithful and will provide them. We may not receive the things over and above our needs, but God knows what is best for us, and will be faithful in taking care of us. He will never let us carry burdens that are too heavy for us to carry. I would encourage each of you, that when you feel overwhelmed with the struggles of life, to turn your burdens over to God and let him faithfully carry them

<br /><br />“They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head.  They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him.  They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.  Then they led him away to crucify him.”
<br />         Matthew 27:28-31
<br /><br />We can never imagine the agony and pain that Jesus suffered that day in Jerusalem before His crucifixion on the hill of Golgotha.  We could never visualize just how disgusting this must have been to the followers of Jesus, as they saw the spit running down Jesus’ face, the blood gushing out of His side, the excruciating agony of the spikes being driven into His hands and His feet, and then finally seeing Him raised onto the cross and watching Him die.  We all need to really be able to visualize this disgusting scene, and have it etched in our thoughts and minds every minute of every day, because it for us that Jesus endured this agony and suffered this pain.  It was for us that He allowed his tormenters to hang Him on the cross.  It was for us that He died that day on Calvary.  It was not a pretty sight, but it is in that disgusting sight, that we need to keep in our minds, that should enable us to find the strength to turn away the sin that we are contemplating.  It is this sight that we need to have engrained in our minds, when we are tempted to do something that we know we should not do.  We need to remember this sight, when evil thoughts begin to pervade our minds and threaten to lead us astray.  Every time that we sin we need to remember this disgusting sight, and it should remind us that Jesus died for us.  I would hope that you would never forget the sacrifice that Jesus made for you that day, and before you sin think about this sight of Jesus on the cross.

<br /><br />“Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.”
<br />        Romans 8:1-2
<br /><br />I am sure that most of us have heard of Murphy’s Law which states that “if anything can go wrong, it will.” Or you may have also heard of the law which states that “if everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.”  There are other laws such as the law of gravity that truly are laws in that they always hold true.  Both the Old Testament and the New Testament speaks about the subject of Law quite extensively. In previous devotionals I have discussed the Law that God gave Moses, that Jesus and the Apostles still followed in their day.  There are two other laws mentioned in the scripture above.  One of these laws “of sin and death” tells us that whoever sins, must die.  This is a frightening law because we all know that we are guilty of sin, and that the consequences of our sin is death.  However there is another law mentioned in the same scripture, and that is the law of the Spirit of Life through Jesus Christ.  This law is probably the most important law of all, as this law is the only thing that can keep the law of sin and death from having its dreaded effect in our lives.  This law tells us that if we live a life in Jesus Christ that this law will save us from our sins.  When Jesus came to earth and was crucified on the cross of Calvary, he died to save us from our sins.  When we accept Jesus as our Savior and ask Him to come into our hearts, and admit that we are a sinner, and that we know He died for our sins and will obey His commands in the future, we are now covered under this New Law of the Spirit of Life.  Everything starts anew and afresh for us, as we are covered by this New Law that brings us blessings from God for those who live in Him.

<br /><br />“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.  When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.”
<br />        Matthew 13:44
<br /><br />This parable that Jesus told teaches us that the kingdom of heaven is of such great value that one should be willing to give up all he has in order to gain it.  Jesus did not imply that one can purchase the kingdom with money or good deeds.  The parable also tells us that the man joyfully made a sacrifice and sold all he had in order to gain the kingdom of heaven.  This man doesn’t just sell everything he has; he does so with joy.  He doesn’t regret it.  He doesn’t complain about the sacrifice he has to make.  In fact, he probably doesn’t even consider it to be a sacrifice.  He gives a lot for the field, but he gets so much more in return.  This parable reminds me of a story about two wealthy Christians, a lawyer and a merchant who were vacationing in Korea.  They saw a field where a boy was pulling a crude plow, and an old man was holding the plow and guiding it.  They asked, “I suppose they are very poor”.  The guide replied, “Yes, when the church was being built, they were eager to give something, but had no money, so they sold their only ox and gave the money to the church.”  The businessman thought for a moment and said, “That must have been a real sacrifice.”  The guide replied, “They do not think that way, as they thought it was fortunate that they had an ox to sell.”  The same principles stated above holds true in our walk with Christ.  Sacrifices will be necessary, but only a deep love for Christ will make them a joy.  The real test of our commitment is not so much whether we are willing to make sacrifices for our Lord and Savior, but whether we are able to make those sacrifices with joy.

<br /><br />“Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?
<br />        Ecclesiastes 8:7
<br /><br />What does the future hold for us?  This is a question that we all ask ourselves throughout our lives.  We begin making plans and dreaming from the time we are youngsters and continue through our old age, trying to figure out what lies ahead of us.  Predicting the future is a difficult thing to do.  And yet we often wonder, what does the future hold for me?  What does God have in mind for my life?  Who will I marry?  What will happen to me when I grow old?  How can I make it through the pain or sorrow I’m experiencing right now? Will things every get better?  When we don’t know what the future holds we often think the worse will happen which causes fear, doubt and anxiety to creep into our minds and rob us of our peace. Predicting the future is so uncertain that the majority of time we get it wrong, as things do not turn out the way we want them to. Some of the most notable predictions that went awry was: “The radio has no future and x-rays are clearly a hoax,”-Royal Society President Lord Kelvin, 1897.  “You ought to go back to driving a truck.” Concert manager firing Elvis Presley in 1954.  “The atom bomb will never go off-and I speak as an expert in explosives.” U.S. Admiral William Leahy in 1945.  As it is obvious no one knows what the future holds for us, except God, and any plans that we make are so uncertain that they can change in an instant.  However God has known the plan He has for each of us even before we were formed in our mother’s womb, as He knows all about us and what He has destined for our life.  The only thing that we can be certain of is that when we turn our life over to God, we are able to predict with certainty that we can spend all eternity with Him in Heaven.

<br /><br />“The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him.”
<br />       Proverbs 18:17
<br /><br />This is a proverb of King Solomon which provides so much wisdom, which we should use every day before we jump to conclusions about anyone or anything.  Most people are quick to come to a conclusion about any issue or matter before hearing both sides of the story.  For example, we’re quick to believe in gossip about a co-worker or a neighbor.  We’re quick to believe everything we hear about our sports heroes, or a politician that is being ridiculed in the press.  We’re quick to condemn people who are accused of crimes that are sensationalized by the media.  When we are quick to jump to conclusions, we usually don’t have the other side of the story, and there usually is another side of the story that could change our opinion.  Many times when we jump to conclusions we can hurt others if they are our family, close friends or neighbors. How can we protect ourselves and keep from hurting others?  There are a number of things we can do, such as to not believe just one side of a story that is told about someone.  We need to hear both sides of the story, and then we can understand the situation better.  We can also protect ourselves from false doctrine by testing what we hear as the Bible suggests.  1st Thessalonians “Test everything.”  It is important that we know the truth, and not over react to what we hear, as we can damage and hurt someone by not knowing the full story.  We need to ask God to give us discernment about what is true and wisdom about what is right.  Too often, we as Christians believe in the wrong thing, and we are too quick to take a stand, without knowing both sides of the story.  Ask God to help you know what is true and not be deceived by untruth, as this can damage and hurt others.

<br /><br />“Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.”
<br />         1st Thessalonians 5:11
<br /><br />Encouragement is such an important trait to master, and each of us should strive to be an encourager to others.  Our children’s attitude and behavior can be shaped, because of a father’s encouragement and motivation.  A sick friend can find encouragement, from a visit by their neighbors and family, and recover more quickly.  An athlete will be more confident and perform better, if they are motivated by an audience of encouragers.  The Bible teaches us that some people have been given the gift of encouragement.  These people are blessed, as they are able to change attitudes, and bring the best out of the people they come into contact with.  An encourager is able to uplift the spirits, and even change the attitude of people they encounter.  An encourager is someone that we all like to meet, as they make us feel better, after our encounter with them.  I have found through 45 years of management experience, that encouragement is a much better motivator than discipline, in getting the most productivity out of your employees.  A carrot dangling in front of a horses face, will motivate him to pull a wagon, more than a whip across his backsides.   Throughout the New Testament, the Apostles were writing letters to the Churches they had established, and almost all of them had statements where they were encouraging the churches and the leaders, to keep up the work they were doing.  I believe that God wants each of us to be an encourager, and to build each other up.  One of the duties of the body of the church is to be an encourager to other members, and through fellowship, encourage and build each other up. Make a point today, to find someone that you can encourage and build up, and God will bless you for it.

<br /><br />“But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”
<br />         2nd Corinthians 12:9
<br /><br />Have you ever thought about how God gives us strength to get through each day, and what life would be like without him?  There are many days that we all feel that we do not have the strength or energy to get up and face the day, but somehow God gives us the energy, and we are able to breeze through the day.  Then there are days that we think we cannot handle one more bit of bad news, but when we receive it, somehow he empowers us to handle it.  Sometimes there are days when we wonder if the money will be there, when the bills come in, but somehow he provides a way, and the bills are paid.  There are other days when temptations seem too strong for us to resist, but somehow he provides a way of escape, and strength to resist.  There are many examples that I could use where God gives us just enough strength and energy to get through, whatever trouble and trials that comes our way.  We all have difficult times in our life, but when we face these struggles, God is always there to help us get through them.  He promises us that he will never forsake us or leave us, and will never load us down with troubles that are more than we can bear.  Yes, God is always there by our side, even though we do not think about him, or call on him as often as we should, he never leaves our side.  God can give us strength to get through our difficult times, and can give us wisdom and guidance, to handle any situation that comes our way.    I would encourage each of you, to remember that God is always there for you. When you are faced with any problem or difficulty, call upon God.  He will be there with you, helping you deal with your situations, giving you strength, and the energy necessary to overcome any difficulty.

<br /><br />“Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.”
<br />         Ephesians 3:20-21
<br /><br />God is able to do much more than we can ever ask for and imagine in our life, as he tells us that anything is possible when we have enough faith and trust in him.  If we truly believe that anything is possible, why do we not have enough faith and believe that anything we ask for will be granted?  If we truly believe in this, why don’t we expect to be cured of our cancer and healed of our other diseases?  Why do we become so fretful, angry and frustrated when things don’t happen the way we want them to, or in our time frame?  Why do we hang on to our problems, such as broken marriages, troubled children and family issues, instead of asking God to mend these for us?  Why doesn’t our finances improve to the point, that we are content and feel safe and secure?  God tells us that everything is possible, but we just don’t have the faith and trust in God that we need to have to make all these things happen.  If only we could have the faith of a tiny mustard seed we could even make mountains move, let alone solve our own small problems.  The answer to all our problems, our difficulties in life and our daily trials lie within reach of all of us, and that is to increase our faith and trust in God, to the point that he will answer all our requests.  When we reach this point however, we will find that the things we were concerned about before are not the concerns that we now have, as so many of our current concerns are things that are of the world, and do not matter anymore.  God is able to do immeasurably more than you could ever ask for or imagine, so why don’t you begin living and believing it today.

<br /><br />“Then Peter said, ‘Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you.  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.”
<br />         Acts 3:6
<br /><br />The scripture above tells about a man who had been lame from birth, that was carried every day to the temple gate to beg.  Everyone who passed by him, to enter the temple, knew who he was, and the condition he was in.  But this was not an ordinary day, as Peter and John were passing by, and the man asked Peter for money.  Peter did not have any money to give, but he gave him all he had to give, which was the faith of a Christian who believed in Jesus Christ.  The amazing thing about this story, is that you and I have exactly what Peter had, both for our life and also to give to others.  We do not have to have money or wealth to give away, but we can share and give our faith in Jesus Christ to others.  Jesus tells us that by faith, we can also do miracles, as if we have faith as small as a mustard seed we can receive whatever we ask for.  Most of the time when we think about giving, we think about writing a check or giving cash to help someone who is in need, but we need to remember that a gift of faith in Jesus Christ is a much greater gift to give to anyone.  If we are able to give someone an eternal life, by getting them to accept Jesus as their savior, this is the greatest gift of all.  We have the opportunity to have the same relationship that Peter had with God, and our faith can be as strong as we want it to be.  The results of our giving can be as life-changing as the results of Peter’s.  The next time when you are faced with a genuine need from someone asking you to give, think about the gift that Peter gave, and offer them the gift of an everlasting life with Christ Jesus.  Money isn’t everything, as an eternal life is a gift worth many times more than silver or gold, and is more precious than any other gift you could give.

<br /><br />“If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”
<br />         2nd Chronicles 7:14
<br /><br />When God spoke to King Solomon, about what He would do when his people humbled themselves and prayed, He gave them a great promise.  He said, “I will heal your land.”  If ever there was a time in America that our great nation is at a cultural and spiritual crossroad, it is today.  The battle for the soul of our nation, and its entire population is raging.  The materialism, sexual perversion, drug and alcohol addiction, abortions, divorce rates and family values, has set our nation on a road that is leading to an unparalleled crisis, like we have never seen before.  It appears that all of this moral failure of the family, and their compromised values, has caused God to look with disfavor on our great nation.  Satan is currently winning the battle for the soul of our land.  The Bible holds the only answer to this dilemma, as shown in the scripture above, and that is that the Church and its body of believers, must begin to seek God with a renewed vigor, and turn from our wicked ways.  The so called Christian majority of our great nation make up the bulk of the population, and I am convinced that if we don’t begin to stand up in faith, and pray to God, and change our behaviors that there is little hope for America’s once bright future.  It is time that all believers commit themselves to stand behind the Old and New Testament scriptures, and come to God in earnest prayer, with clean hands and pure hearts, and ask Him to intervene on behalf of our nation.  If we start now to humble ourselves, and ask him for forgiveness, God will hear our prayers, and will again heal our land.

<br /><br />“Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.”
<br />         Ephesians 5:20
<br /><br />Do you sing and make music in your heart daily to the Lord?  This is such an inspiring scripture that all of us should aspire to do each day.  How often do we really give God thanks for all that He has done in our lives?  I mean really taking the time to look up into the face of Jesus, and with grateful hearts of praise, offer sincere thanks to Him.  I think we can all honestly say not often enough.  Most people only go to God when they are having troubles in their lives, and need help to solve their problems.  This is good, but we need to go to God each morning even when things seem rosy for us, and thank Him for blessing us.  We live in a nation that so far God has blessed, as most of us have material possessions that far outweigh what our ancestors had.  God has blessed us with many things, and when we wake up in the morning we should thank God for all our blessings.  He should be first on our thoughts and our minds each day, and our lives should be focused on doing His will during the hours ahead.  The scripture above says to give thanks for all things, even the small things that we often take for granted, as God has provided them to us.  I believe that a thankful heart is something that will get God’s attention, more than anything we could do each day, but it needs to be a heart that is filled with, faith, gratitude, and sincerity and really come from within us, and show God that we really are thankful.    We need to learn to offer thanks to God with a grateful heart, regardless of what we are going through.  I would encourage each of you to begin your day with a “Prayer of Thanksgiving” to God.

<br /><br />“Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith, test yourselves.”
<br />          2nd Corinthians 13:5
<br /><br />Every day almost all of us will have problems and difficulties that Satan will send our way that will test our faith.  Satan wants us to constantly be in a state of confusion, not knowing which way to turn, as we are vulnerable to temptations during this time.  Knowing that we will be attacked in this manner, it is important to keep reminding ourselves that God is the only one that matters, and that he is in control.  We must constantly test ourselves, and reflect back to see that we are not losing our focus, and taking our eyes off God.  It is easy to be distracted by the ways of the world, and compromise our values and succumb to the things that others do.  Just because our friends go to see a movie or listen to music that is not justifiable in God’s sight, does not mean that we need to follow along.  This is what has happened to our generation, as we have compromised our family values, just a little at a time, until now something that our ancestors and God would not have permitted, is now acceptable as routine.  There is no compromise in God’s eyes, as if something is just a little bad, it is completely bad.  Just a few bad words in a movie or a song, contaminates the entire production and we should not compromise our values, because the next movie and song may have a few more bad words, which will shortly lead to us compromising our values even more.  I would encourage each of you to examine and test yourselves, and determine if you are slowly compromising your values.  Are you following the ways of the world and succumbing to the temptations from others around you.  Ask yourself if God would be pleased with what you are allowing to come into your life and your homes.  Test yourself to see if you are in the faith.

<br /><br />“Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm.  Let nothing move you.  Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.”
<br />         1st Corinthians 15:58
<br /><br />Because of Christ’s resurrection, we know that serving Him is not useless activity, as our labor is not in vain.  Our effort is invested in the Lord’s winning cause, and we will be rewarded at His second coming.  During the past several years I have observed that most people are prone to set back, and not give 100% of themselves to doing work for God.  It is difficult to find people to distribute food to the needy, to help counsel with people who are going through tough times in their lives, or to generally just help people who are in need of other assistance.  Most of these people are willing to discuss the problems and offer solutions, but when it comes to actually doing the work, most want to set back and wait for someone else to do the work.  Just as the saying goes, “there usually are too many chiefs and not enough Indians”.   This is not giving yourself fully to the Lord and doing His work.  God gives us clear and concise commands about helping our neighbors who are in need, and when we let our other commitments get in the way, we are committing a sin in the eyes of God.  I believe we can commit just as great a sin by not doing something, as we can by doing something that we know is wrong.  When we see someone going hungry, or needing clothing or shelter, and do not respond to their needs, when we have the resources to help, we have sinned in God’s eyes.  Please take a moment and look at your own lives to see if you are giving yourself fully to the work of the Lord.  Jesus tells you to love others as you love yourself. Take time to test yourself to see if you are following His commands.  When you give fully to do God’s work, your labor will not be in vain.
