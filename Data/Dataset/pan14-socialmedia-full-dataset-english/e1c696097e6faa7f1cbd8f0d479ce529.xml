They may be costly but anyone who gets to wear a Prada does not only wear the brand but also prestige and glamour. Aside from bags, which are the most popular product of the brand, <strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC9wcmFkYT9fX19zdG9yZT1kZWZhdWx0" target="_blank">Prada sunglasses</a></em></strong> are also making a name of their own. We see lots of celebrities wearing Prada sunglasses – which is what makes this eyepiece wanted.
<br /><br />However, buying <strong>designer sunglasses</strong> these days have become more challenging with the emergence of online scammers as well as imitations. Imitators do a good job making copycats of the item that if you’re a first-time buyer, you’d hardly tell which one is real and which one is actually fake.
<br /><br /><strong>To help you spot fake Prada sunglasses, here are some tips for you to keep in mind.
<br /><br />Get into the details.</strong> First, genuine <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS8_" target="_blank"><strong><em>Prada sunglasses</em></strong></a> display the sunglass information on either of the inner temples. This information includes the model number, color, and the dimension. Some sunglasses display information but when you take a close look, you realize that these do not seem to match the sunglass model. Before you buy, make sure that every detail matches the sunglass model.
<br /><br /><strong>Get to the box.</strong> Authentic Prada sunglasses come with a box. The box is dark grey in color which looks like a shoe box. You will find the Prada logo printed on the middle while bar codes may be located at the bottom of the box. If your box seem to have gotten all these wrong, be wary as you could have gotten a fake one.
<br /><br /><strong>The casing. </strong>Inside the box, you’ll find the sunglass case. The case is made from leather but the inner material is suede. On top of the case, you should see the Prada logo, embossed, not printed. The case should also flip open, not zippers not buttons.
<br /><br /><strong>Examine the Prada cloth.</strong> Your complete kit should also come with a black microfiber cloth with a Prada logo in the middle. Its edges are now sewn neatly but rather jagged.
<br /><br /><strong>The certificate.</strong> Just like buying luxury bags, your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC9tYXVpLWppbT9fX19zdG9yZT1kZWZhdWx0" target="_blank"><strong><em>Prada sunglasses</em></strong></a> should also come with a plastic authenticity card. The white card is contained in a small envelope.
<br /><br />Buying <strong>Prada sunglasses</strong> can be quite tricky, especially if it’s your first time. But understanding such details will help you land a genuine pair that’s worth keeping, wearing, and spending for.

Gone are the days when they'll go as far as hopping from one store or mall to another. Even luxury items such as bags, gadgets, and cars can now be purchased through the Internet. Another hot item which is commonly searched for on online shops and auction shops is <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC9tZW4uaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><strong><em>designer sunglasses</em></strong></a>. However, if you wish to buy sunglasses online, there are a few safety precautions that you have to keep in mind. Doing so will help you ensure that you don't fall into the hands of crooks who are just talking you into spending your money on nothing.
<br /><br /><strong>Be sure that you observe the following safety precautions when you buy sunglasses online:
<br /><br />Spotting the spammer.</strong> The only downside of online selling is that it is used by thieves to get as much money as they can from customers. It is important that you keep yourself well-versed with the red flags. For instance, if you find a Chanel sunglass sold at $50, think again. Chanel as well as other designer sunglasses range between $150- $500, depending on the model. More recent collection retail even higher. Before you get yourself in big trouble, make sure that you've conducted a quick background check on the seller. Check out comments from previous customers and call the contact number stated on the website.
<br /><br /><strong>Secured payment options. </strong>Fraud is rampant on the online marketplace. If you buy <strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC93b21lbi5odG1s" target="_blank">sunglasses online</a></em></strong>, your most convenient payment option would be paying through credit card, debit card or Paypal. Before you enter your financial details, make sure that you untick the box that retains information on your next visit. This can out you in serious financial trouble especially if you're using a public computer. Buyers are also advised to be cautious with regular deductions. For instance, if you're getting a product on installment, make sure that the charges will end on the last month of installment, as stated in the contract.
<br /><br /><strong>Detecting the fake.</strong> Another factor to watch for when you buy sunglasses online is the rampancy of fake items. On the photos, an item can look exactly like a real Chanel but when you receive your shipment, only then will you realize that you bought a fake. 
<br /><br />Keep these safety tips in mind when you buy <strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS8_" target="_blank">sunglasses online</a></em></strong> and save yourself from spending money on nothing.

The beach would probably come in first. Then, bikinis, flip flops, reggae, and beer. For women who want to look at their best in every season, summer is the time of the year to head out to the beach and wear their bikinis and accessories. One of the most important accessories that every beach bum should have is women sunglasses.
<br /><br /><strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC93b21lbi5odG1s" target="_blank">women sunglasses</a></em></strong> may be commonly seen as a mere accessory, especially when modeled, by some of our favorite celebrities. But we should not forget the fact that we wear a sunglass not just for style; but most importantly, for sun protection. When we stay long hours in the outdoors, we could be sacrificing our good eyesight. The harmful rays coming from the sun can cause a wide range of diseases such as poor vision, cataracts, and if the problem gets worse, even blindness. Because of this, it’s always important that we wear women sunglasses especially during summer. Use your sunnies both as a functional and a style accessory. To help you come out as the season’s most in-demand beach bum, ramp off the beach shores by pairing your women sunglasses with the following.
<br /><br /><strong>A cute bikini.</strong> Summer is the perfect time of the year to flaunt our bikini bodies. So stop hiding and show them what you’ve got. Certain bikini cuts and style complement certain body types so if you want to look at your best, make sure that you pick a style that would best suit your body type. Of course, match your bikini with a nice pair of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS9zaG9wL2luZGV4LnBocC9wcmFkYT9fX19zdG9yZT1kZWZhdWx0" target="_blank">women sunglasses</a>. It doesn’t matter what style you pick, the most important thing to keep in mind is that you’re sunglass comes with an incontestable protection.
<br /><br /><strong>A sundress.</strong> If you’re not too keen about wearing a bikini, you can wear a sundress to the beach. It can also serve as a cover-up which you can take off later on if you decide to take a plunge in the water. Again, the sunglass that you wear will have to depend on your personal style. If you feel like channeling a rock star at the beach, then go for a pair of Ray-Ban aviators. Ray-Ban offers women sunglasses in different shades. The Wayfarer would also make a good choice. However, if you’re feeling a little girly, go ahead and channel Viktoria Beckham and put on those oversized women sunglasses to wow everyone.
<br /><br />It does not matter what fashion pieces you match with your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW5nbGFzc2Vzd2FyZWhvdXNlLmNvbS5hdS8_" target="_blank"><strong><em>women sunglasses</em></strong></a>. The most important thing to consider is the protection that your sunglass can offer. Don’t just settle for a stylish piece, always check the specifications first and see if it can really protect your eyes even after long hours of staying under the sun.
