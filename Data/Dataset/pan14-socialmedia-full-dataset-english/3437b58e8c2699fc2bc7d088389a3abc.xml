This comes after a lot of scepticism in the past from authorities that stated female boxing is unwarranted and failed to reach 'standards of medical safety and universality'. When thinking about equality for women in sport - and in life - you would think that this is common practice and inequality is basically non-existent. However, 2012 is the first year in which female boxing will be incorporated into the Olympic Games, proving that inequality is more present than one would think.<br /><br />Just as it seems the female boxing world has had a breakthrough - being included in the Olympic Games - the AIBA (Amateur International Boxing Association) seems to take a step backward when they proposed that women - if they are to compete in the games - are to ditch MMA clothing for miniskirts. This provoked outrage from female competitors and fans alike, with a female boxer stating that she didn't 'even wear a miniskirt 'on a night out' and 'definitely wouldn't be wearing one in the ring'.<br /><br />This proposition by the AIBA is reminiscent of FIFA President's Sepp Blatter's idea back in 2004 that female soccer players should wear tighter shorts to enhance the sport's popularity. This is another case of gender inequality that female boxers face with the sport's authority finding that women should be treated differently than male boxers. Even though most women and men would agree that when training they both wear similar MMA training gear.<br /><br />Wearing a mini skirt in the ring will not enhance female boxer's technique any more than it would if a man was wearing one. The AIBA said it was so that people could differentiate between men and women - a statement which could be interpreted in a negative way from female fighters. If they wanted to get the best out of and enhance their fighting technique female boxers should be allowed to wear professional MMA gear which is tailored and designed specifically to do this, rather than essentially sexualising the sport with miniskirts.<br /><br />To summarise, the world of female boxing has been around for a long time and has endured a lot of scrutiny, even though it has just now been included in the Olympics as an acceptable sport it hasn't done so without facing further problems to overcome. When thinking about how long female boxing has been around in relation to people's ideological stance on the sport it is clear to see that views about boxing are still very bias and not as evolved as one would think - even though we are in the 21st century.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWdib29rLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8yMjU3MjI3" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy80NjE2NTItS2lkcy1LYXJhdGUtY2xhc3Nlcy1Ib3VzdG9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL3NwYWNlY3AucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1jb250YWN0cw__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>

Soon, you'll adjust to the volume and primarily you'll get stronger by maximising neuromuscular efficiency.<br /><br />Don't fall in to the trap of thinking that, if you're not sore, the workout wasn't effective. Keep a log of your training, and if you either lifted more weight, did movements faster or did more reps than your previous session, then you've improved your performance.<br /><br />Myth #4:<br /><br />&quot; I don't have enough time to lift weights&quot;<br /><br />Fact:<br /><br />If you follow a good quality, specific MMA strength and conditioning training program like mentioned above, then two or three 50 minute minute sessions per week will mean you'll make significant and consistent progression. This will allow you more than enough time to train your MMA skills.<br /><br />Bodybuilders have to spend much more time training, as their workouts are designed to focus on specific muscle groups. As mentioned above, a bodybuilder's physique is useless for MMA, so you won't have to worry about that.<br /><br />Myth #5:<br /><br />&quot;I'll gas if I lift weights&quot;<br /><br />Fact:<br /><br />This is a strange one, that keeps cropping up on forums. The fact is, you'll gas if you don't train all 3 energy systems, all of which get used throughout a typical MMA fight:<br /><br />ATP-CP system - (high energy, instantly, without oxygen for about 10 seconds. In basic terms, this is the energy system you'll use when you're in the clinch and attempt a throw). <br />Anaerobic (providing energy w/o oxygen for about 2 mins. If you're boxing for the first 2 mins of a round, say, then you'll use this) <br />Aerobic (long term energy at a low level, using oxygen. Breathing throughout the round, when you're grappling, doing stand up and clinching to clear the lactate from your muscles will use this).<br /><br />An awesome circuit to incorporate all of these would be something like (sprinting between exercises):<br /><br />* Medicine ball tosses over the head, 2 reps, as high as you can, explosively,<br /><br />* Inverted row (6 reps)<br /><br />* Clap push ups (6 reps)<br /><br />* Medicine ball side tosses, explosively as you can, 2 reps, sprinting between reps<br /><br />* Kettle bell swings, from between legs to head height (6 reps)<br /><br />* Squat jumps (6 reps)<br /><br />* Medicine ball front slam, with burpee between (6 reps).<br /><br />Do this 3 times, and you will feel it!<br /><br />Myth #6:<br /><br />&quot;I need to do strength and conditioning 6 times a week to make progress.&quot;<br /><br />Fact:<br /><br />If you're training strength and conditioning 6 times a week, then the program that you're following is totally inefficient. You're either training too slow, taking too much rest or working muscle groups instead of movements.<br /><br />Training your muscles to failure often will mean that your mma skills sessions will suffer. Your muscles and/or nervous system will be shot, meaning your technique will be sloppy, your progress will be slower and you're likely to be caught with more shots in sparring.<br /><br />Don't forget that whilst you're thai boxing, grappling and sparring, you're working on your conditioning. It may not be a pure conditioning workout, but it still contributes to your overall progress.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXN0ZWQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvbWljaGVsZm9ycmVzNjE0L2Jsb2dzLzQxNTc3My8_" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9NTU2ODc0Ng__" target="_blank">Click here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL21pY2hlbGZvcnJlczYxNC81ODU0NjY5L2tpZHNfbWFydGlhbF9hcnRzX2NsYXNzZXNfaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>

Many common people are interested in mixed martial arts workouts as it promises to keep you in shape and give extra strength.<br /><br />Begin with warm up exercises. They should be light ones like sprints, skipping, pushups etc. Then gradually try to improve your cardio. Running is considered an excellent exercise for this purpose. If you are not a regular runner, then start slow at first. Do not force yourself for more than two to five miles a day. Increase your speed slowly but steadily. Don't overwork on the first day and then sit on bed for the next whole week. Then use some body weight exercises and free weights.<br /><br />Buy a heavy bag for yourself to practice your kicks and punches. Also work your knees and elbows on them. If a friend of yours is also interested in mixed martial arts workouts, or if you have someone as capable as you are, then try boxing with him. Focus on your defense more at first. Required materials like gloves must be worn.<br /><br />Usually gyms have all the required equipment, but if proper equipment are unavailable, you can still carry out your work out by using household items. Like for the dips, use a pair of chairs. You don't have to spend large sums of money to keep yourself fit. You might probably have few of these already in your homes like the skipping rope and heavy bags. Buy an ab wheel or just do crunches, the wheel however is good for your upper body and shoulders as well. Resistance bands could also be bought. They work on upper and as well as lower body. Another fruitful investment could be in buying an exercise ball. These equipment are not only inexpensive but are easily available almost everywhere.<br /><br />Apart from these exercises, take care of what you are eating. Strictly avoid junks and alcohols. Go for proteins and it is better if you eat meat and fish as a protein source. Have sufficient water and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. These workouts would not fully benefit you unless your diet is proper. You can take wholegrain foods, pulses and dairy products. If you want to stay fit, then get all the proper nutrients your body might need. I always recommend MMA supplements to my new fighters. It helps them recover as fast as possible and get the best possible workouts in the shortest time. There is a new supplement class on the market that was designed specifically for MMA fighters called a neural-adaptogen. If you can find a product like this, buy it!<br /><br />Never forgot to keep training hard, eating right, and getting in the best supplements. By doing this we may even one day see you in the octagon.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy80NjE2NzUtS2lkcy1tYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMtY2xhc3Nlcy1Ib3VzdG9uLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0cmVuZ3RoLm9yZy9wZW9wbGUvMjA4NDQwMy9qb3VybmFs" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50ZXN0ZWQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvbWljaGVsZm9ycmVzNjE0L2Jsb2dzLzQxNTg0Ni8_" target="_blank">Find out more</a>

You may want to know a few things before you get started with your MMA classes. You will want to do a little research on the subject before you just go to the first MMA gym to start MMA classes. Many people may just want a unique style of training. Most MMA gyms have many different instructors, from many different disciplines, to help you in your training.<br /><br />When you first start your search for MMA classes you will want to ask yourself and your potential trainer some questions to know exactly what you will be learning and how they will be training you. You need to know exactly what it is that you want to learn, hand to hand combat, self defense, or training for competition. A trained martial arts instructor will be able to help guide you in this process.<br /><br />If you are wanting to train for competition, then the MMA classes that you are seeking will probably be different than the training of someone who is just looking for self defense lessons. If you have had formal training in the past and are looking for MMA training then you may want to find the right instructors for the form of martial arts you are to be practicing. While MMA means Mixed Martial Arts, you may want formal training in a discipline that is different form the one that you have already been formally trained in, such a Brazilian jiu jitsu and maybe you have had form muay thai training in the past, for example.<br /><br />The MMA as an art is been adopted by many police and military agency to formally train their personnel for the streets or for combat. That is what makes MMA classes a great form of self defense. An MMA instructor will teach you not only the how to survive the fight but as well how to win. The MMA approach is used by law enforcement agencies around the world because it works well to teach personnel the best submission techniques and self defense.<br /><br />The military has been using the MMA martial arts disciplines as their basis for military combat training for years. This is largely due to the fact that MMA teaches many disciplines. You will learn a full approach to the art of self defense when you go for MMA classes.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbGl2ZW5vdGRlYWQuY29tL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNy9UaGlzLXNpdGUtcHJvZmlsZS0yNzc4NDEwLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTMwNDMwX2tpZHNfa2FyYXRlX2NsYXNzZXNfaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2hhZWJ6b2tlbGh1ZHNoZW9uLnBvZG9tYXRpYy5jb20vZW50cnkvMjAxMi0wOS0wOFQwOF8wMF80OC0wN18wMA__" target="_blank">This site</a>

Since your body is primarily made up of 70% water, decreasing this percentage in a healthy and safe way, using sweatsuits is an ideal and time effective way of losing a few pounds.<br /><br />When MMA training, strengthening is a goal which is most visible and effective, putting more force behind your attacks in a match is something which can only enhance your chances of a win. Keeping around your weight class is another thing which must be kept in mind when MMA training for you to even qualify to compete in a match. A week or two before a weigh in is an ideal time to employ your MMA gear, like a sweatsuit to reap all the benefits. Here we share the top three benefits of MMA clothing for MMA training.<br /><br />1) Weight Loss with MMA clothing<br /><br />Obviously as discussed earlier, MMA gear like sweat suits are primarily used to shed water weight. The material that sweat suits are made from restricts the evaporation of sweat which increases your body temperature and in turn, increases your sweating rate. This increased perspiration allows you to shed your water weight but also increases your metabolism.<br /><br />2) Sweat suits are deal for colder temperatures <br /><br />If implementing cardio into your MMA training, this will often include running and fast walking. If you're somewhere sunny and warm this will be no problem at all. However, if you find yourself in a country where hot and sunny is a rarity, MMA clothing for training can provide a consistent temperature at which to work out, perhaps resulting in you feeling more confident and more inclined to face the bitter cold.<br /><br />3) MMA clothing for training cleanses the body<br /><br />As sweat suits increase your sweating rate they also rid the body of impurities via sweating. Replenishing your body's water content after utilising a sweat suit provides a detoxifying effect on the body, cleansing the body of impurities gained from smoking, alcohol intake and exposure to chemicals etc.<br /><br />These are the three main benefits which can be gained when utilising MMA clothing, like a sweat suit safely. They are great for short term weight loss, making them an essential piece of MMA gear. Nonetheless they do not need to be exclusive to MMA training and could be used as a simple detoxifying agent for the body.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9NTU2ODcxOQ__" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdXBlcm5vdmEuY29tL0hhZWJ6b2tlbEh1ZHNoZW9uL2Jsb2cvNjg4NTIz" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rYW5ldmEuY29tL2Jsb2cvNTYxNjQyLmJsb2c_" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>

Having a lack of flexibility can result in a lot of strain on the joints and muscles, which can not only hinder performance and increase that chances of getting an injury.<br /><br />The Benefits Of Increased Flexibility<br /><br />Improving your flexibility will allow you to create a greater range of movement in the shoulders, hips and trunk. This will increase your speed, agility and endurance. Good flexibility will help a fighter preserve energy as the muscles have less work to do when achieving a range of movement. This will enable the fighter to kick higher, escape submissions and perform moves with better technique.<br /><br />Flexibility Training Program<br /><br />When you devise a flexibility training program you should always remember that everyone is different. This means that the range of movement in one person could vary considerably to the next. Some people are more naturally flexible than others. This means that a training regime should be specifically focused around the practitioners capabilities.<br /><br />Guidelines For Stretching<br /><br />There are certain rules that martial artists must always follow when stretching to increase flexibility. This will ensure that the practitioner remains safe and gets the maximum benefits from the techniques.<br /><br />Always make sure that the muscles are warmed up prior to performing a stretch. <br />The muscles should always remain relaxed when performing the techniques by maintaining a normal breathing pattern. <br />Always start with major muscles groups before moving to smaller ones. <br />The muscles should be stretched beyond their normal range and then held for between ten seconds and two minutes <br />Once held the for the required duration of time more pressure should be applied to the muscles. <br /><br />By following these guidelines, you shouldn't have any problems. If you ever suspect that you have an injury, or if you are having pains whilst performing exercise then you should seek medical attention immediately.<br /><br />Learning The Techniques<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of different techniques that are used to increase your flexibility. If you don't know what you're doing then you should always seek help from a professional. There are a number of ways to get professional advice. Many people choose to ask instructors at their MMA gyms, whilst others prefer to take yoga classes. The internet is also home to a lot of resources dedicated to the subject. Downloading and following specially designed programs will certainly help you out.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNy81ODU0NzU5L2NsaWNrX2hlcmU_" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kZWluZWtvbGxlZ2VuLmRlL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9NTU2ODgwNw__" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sYWdib29rLmNvbS9ibG9ncy8yMjU3Mjgw" target="_blank">Click here</a>

For all those who are really serious and very passionate about mixed martial art then you should enroll yourself in a fitness and training centre in your area. To be able to do that one needs to be capable to find the right place for learning this. There are certain things that you need to keep in mind:<br /><br />Online search<br /><br />Search engines like Google and Yahoo! provides a lot of information of the training centers in and around your area helping you narrow down the scope of search. Type the area in which you live along with the mixed martial arts name for getting to know the available options.<br /><br />You could also try to go on some forum and find the specific areas that people might be going to. Posting a question to these social networking will help you narrow down your search.<br /><br />Research on the type of mixed martial arts events that are going on and then list down those centers that take part in it.<br /><br />Research each option<br /><br />Search about the background of the instructor. Find out whether he is qualified enough to be able to train you. Find out the agenda of the class and the extra things that he provides. Cost of the classes is an important factor too. Try to enroll in a program which has a special team which fights. This highlights that they are in to events and are vigorous in it. Go to the contact us section and ask them all enquires that you have.<br /><br />Read reviews or articles<br /><br />Find the out the reviews that are available about the school that you intend on joining. There will be many that are good and then there will be some that are bad. Confirm both of them. Find out whether the reviews that have been posted are relevant and true. Find out whether the quality is the same as that which has been posted. Since you are going to be shelling out cash for it do try to find out everything that there is about it to find out.<br /><br />Personally visit the gym<br /><br />Go to the gyms that are in question and see the place for yourself. Talk to the in charge and find out the typical routine that is followed there. There should be specialized classes for each subject of importance like striking, wrestling and grappling.<br /><br />Economy of the class<br /><br />Talk to the instructor about the pricing of the class. Is it really the best price that has been offered to you or is it just an attempt to get you to sign up for the class. You should assess from the attitude of the instructor.<br /><br />Look at all this and ask for a free class to be able to check the quality of the class if you are satisfied then go further with it.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsQXJ0cy5jb20_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbi8_" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>

		<document id="e1d7a5f9eea91bbcf0a6fe66a23f51a7" url=""><![CDATA[Kids Martial Arts Houston<br/><br/>Most people think of water sports like surfing when they think of a rash guard. However, the ones that are used for the purpose of MMA (mixed martial arts) are somewhat different.<br /><br />One thing they have in common with those used for water sports is that they both provide the fundamental protection that is often needed when participating in such a physical sport. However, one key difference is in the way they handle body heat. The water sport variety is made to help keep you warm while you're in the water. Since you most likely won't be doing any MMA training or competing in the water, staying warm isn't a problem. On the contrary, most MMA fighters try to stay as cool as possible. Wearing a rash guard meant to trap heat would obviously not be a wise choice in this situation. That's why MMA rash guards are designed to help keep you cool, in contrast to their water sport counterparts.<br /><br />Another benefit of wearing this protective type of shirt when competing is that it is very difficult for an opponent or training partner to grab onto it like they could a t-shirt or other types of loose clothing. Minimizing the amount of loose-hanging clothing on your body is an important part of optimizing your MMA performance.<br /><br />Choosing a Sleeve Length<br /><br />One question you may be faced with when shopping for an MMA rash guard is whether you should purchase one with short sleeves, or the long sleeved variety. This really boils down to a matter of personal preference. Short-sleeved rash guards are ideal for staying as cool as possible, while the long-sleeved type offers more overall protection, so it's a bit of a trade-off. Most brands offer both varieties.<br /><br />Where to Buy Them<br /><br />In order to filter out all the rash guards for sale that are not specifically crafted for MMA use, you should only shop from quality MMA gear retailers that specialize in these types of products. When searching online, be sure to include the keyword &quot;MMA&quot; in your search queries to ensure you get the appropriate results. Some of the most popular manufacturers include Hayabusa, Cageside MMA, and Bad Boy MMA.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsQXJ0cy5jb20_" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYW1iYW1tYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20vbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLWtpZHMtaG91c3Rvbg__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>

Here we share the top three benefits of MMA clothing for MMA training.<br /><br />1) Weight Loss with MMA clothing<br /><br />Obviously as discussed earlier, MMA gear like sweat suits are primarily used to shed water weight. The material that sweat suits are made from restricts the evaporation of sweat which increases your body temperature and in turn, increases your sweating rate. This increased perspiration allows you to shed your water weight but also increases your metabolism.<br /><br />2) Sweat suits are deal for colder temperatures <br /><br />If implementing cardio into your MMA training, this will often include running and fast walking. If you're somewhere sunny and warm this will be no problem at all. However, if you find yourself in a country where hot and sunny is a rarity, MMA clothing for training can provide a consistent temperature at which to work out, perhaps resulting in you feeling more confident and more inclined to face the bitter cold.<br /><br />3) MMA clothing for training cleanses the body<br /><br />As sweat suits increase your sweating rate they also rid the body of impurities via sweating. Replenishing your body's water content after utilising a sweat suit provides a detoxifying effect on the body, cleansing the body of impurities gained from smoking, alcohol intake and exposure to chemicals etc.<br /><br />These are the three main benefits which can be gained when utilising MMA clothing, like a sweat suit safely. They are great for short term weight loss, making them an essential piece of MMA gear. Nonetheless they do not need to be exclusive to MMA training and could be used as a simple detoxifying agent for the body.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNy5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTUwNTY1NQ__" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VrQ2FybnVtYWhvcmFuS3lsYS5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wOS8xMC8xMzc3MDM1MS1jbGljay1oZXJl" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzQwNzQ4MCZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjI1MDAwJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDt1c2VyX2lkPTc2MjUwMDAmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPW1ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNw__" target="_blank">Click here</a>

Many of these techniques have been adapted for western boxing punches. Parries to change the direction of the strike can be an effective defensive technique, for example if your opponent uses a jab a downwards tap will send the jab off target. When sparring you will need the correct sparring gloves, each set of gloves are measured in ounces you can find sparring glove at most MMA clothing retailers.<br /><br />Elbow (Ti Sok) <br /><br />Elbow Slash, Horizontal Elbow, Uppercut Elbow, Forward Elbow Thrust, Reverse Horizontal Elbow, Spinning Elbow, Elbow Chop, Double Elbow Chop, Mid-Air Elbow Strike are the main techniques used, an important part of mastering this technique is mastering the guard. For Example you would start in the standard stance with your fists at eye level, if using your right elbow, your right hand would come across your face and rest under the left side of your chin, you left hand would come up to cover your forehead. This is important when using andelbow as it only has a small striking range you cannot leave yourself vulnerable when you step into the move.<br /><br />Kicking (Te) <br /><br />Straight Kick, Roundhouse Kick, Diagonal Kick, Half Shin Half Knee Kick, Spinning Heel Kick, Down Roundhouse Kick, Axe Heel Kick, Jump Kick, Step-Up kick are the techniques used. For those who have not done a martial art before it is useful to know that when you strike you do not make contact with your foot, your shin should make contact. The reason for not using the top of your foot to make contact is because your foot contains many small bones, making contact with you shin reduces the risk of injury and using your shin has a stronger level of impact. A popular defensive move against kicks is the shin block. Remember jogging bottoms will not be appropriate even when training as they restrict movement and will not enable to carry out the moves to the best potential, shorts are ideal for training in, you can buy these at any MMA clothing retailer.<br /><br />Knee (Ti Khao) <br /><br />Straight Knee Strike, Diagonal Knee Strike, Curving Knee Strike, Horizontal Knee Strike, Knee Slap, Knee Bomb, Flying Knee, Step-Up Knee Strike are some of the techniques used. Again as with all the moves it is important to keep your guard up and keep your balance. With some of these moves you can also see the boxer holding the opponent head in a clench and bringing the knee upward.<br /><br />Foot Thrust (Thip) <br /><br />Straight Foot Thrust, Sideways Foot Thrust, Reverse Foot Thrust, Slapping Foot thrust, Jumping Foot Thrust are the techniques used. These are defensive techniques that are used to control distance or block attacks. Foot Thrusts are a quick but powerful move that will throw the opponent off balance.<br /><br />There are a lot more techniques especially defensive techniques to learn, yet with all the moves that you learn keeping your guard up and your balance is important. The six categories of defensive techniques are, blocking, redirection, avoidance, evasion, disruption, anticipation.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvdGh5dmxnZ3dkYWNld2N0cWN0ZmUvY29udGVudC90aGlzLXNpdGUtNjM0Mzk1Mg__" target="_blank">Houston kickboxing</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VrQ2FybnVtYWhvcmFuS3lsYS5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wOS8xMC8xMzc3MDM1MS1jbGljay1oZXJl" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4MDIwNzcvaG91c3Rvbi1tYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMv" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>

We love action games, action movies and they get better when we talk of action sports. Competitors fighting right out there; live, and if it is an unarmed combat of skills, attack and defense then it has to be a runaway mass favorite. That is what happened with wrestling as we know it now. Mixed Martial Arts is certainly the sport of the future and it would not take a wild guess or a detailed knowledge of the sport to conclude so.<br /><br />Mix<br /><br />When MMA was not as popular as today, it involved a fighter specialized in a certain specific form of the art combating against one who is specialized in another form of martial arts. Although it made for a grilling fight to finish, normal audience who did not know much about either forms of the art found MMA to be a little classy and sophisticated. For a sport to have a solid future it needs to be accepted by a large section of common people.<br /><br />As Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) evolved over the last decade, we eventually landed up with modern MMA and that was not specialized martial arts with its integral forms but a combo of martial arts, boxing, wrestling, kickboxing, judo and other combat arts. This blend brought in a new breed of fighters who could attack and defend with equal vigor and had their arms and legs talk with the same intensity and brutality.<br /><br />This hybrid form that has gained major popularity just over the last few years is bound to grow. Sports experts all around the world have taken notice of how much MMA have grown and developed in this century. Everyone knows where it is headed from here. Today, young guns are training in multiple disciplines (cross training) so they can come up as strong contenders on the modern MMA platform.<br /><br />MMA competitions are being aired to a larger audience, the number of MMA gyms are soaring and so is the number of people walking into the stadium to watch a fight live. It may not be wrong to assume that MMA could well surpass the popularity of boxing. Well, that change may not happen this year or the next, but apparently, it is all set to get there. It is only a matter of time. We continue to see better trained athletes and that is also why MMA is the sport of the future.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmNvbXBhbnkuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWljaGVsZm9ycmVzNjE0JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9MTg2MTE4NQ__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4MDIxNTIvdGhpcy1zaXRlLw__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VrQ2FybnVtYWhvcmFuS3lsYS5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wOS8xMC8xMzc3MDQ0MS1raWRzLWthcmF0ZS1jbGFzc2VzLWhvdXN0b24_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>

This comes after a lot of scepticism in the past from authorities that stated female boxing is unwarranted and failed to reach 'standards of medical safety and universality'. When thinking about equality for women in sport - and in life - you would think that this is common practice and inequality is basically non-existent. However, 2012 is the first year in which female boxing will be incorporated into the Olympic Games, proving that inequality is more present than one would think.<br /><br />Just as it seems the female boxing world has had a breakthrough - being included in the Olympic Games - the AIBA (Amateur International Boxing Association) seems to take a step backward when they proposed that women - if they are to compete in the games - are to ditch MMA clothing for miniskirts. This provoked outrage from female competitors and fans alike, with a female boxer stating that she didn't 'even wear a miniskirt 'on a night out' and 'definitely wouldn't be wearing one in the ring'.<br /><br />This proposition by the AIBA is reminiscent of FIFA President's Sepp Blatter's idea back in 2004 that female soccer players should wear tighter shorts to enhance the sport's popularity. This is another case of gender inequality that female boxers face with the sport's authority finding that women should be treated differently than male boxers. Even though most women and men would agree that when training they both wear similar MMA training gear.<br /><br />Wearing a mini skirt in the ring will not enhance female boxer's technique any more than it would if a man was wearing one. The AIBA said it was so that people could differentiate between men and women - a statement which could be interpreted in a negative way from female fighters. If they wanted to get the best out of and enhance their fighting technique female boxers should be allowed to wear professional MMA gear which is tailored and designed specifically to do this, rather than essentially sexualising the sport with miniskirts.<br /><br />To summarise, the world of female boxing has been around for a long time and has endured a lot of scrutiny, even though it has just now been included in the Olympics as an acceptable sport it hasn't done so without facing further problems to overcome. When thinking about how long female boxing has been around in relation to people's ideological stance on the sport it is clear to see that views about boxing are still very bias and not as evolved as one would think - even though we are in the 21st century.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNy5wb3N0ZXJvdXMuY29tL2hvdXN0b24ta2lja2JveGluZw__" target="_blank">Kids Martial Arts Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21pY2hlbGZvcnJlczYxNC5qaWdzeS5jb20vZW50cmllcy9nZW5lcmFsL0ZpbmQtb3V0LW1vcmUtMg__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNy5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTUwNTUyMQ__" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>

Whenever an MMA fighter enters the ring, it is quite crucial that they have a high level of stamina. Not only does the outcome of any MMA fight depend on a fighter's stamina, but having a higher stamina can make a huge difference for any fighter during an MMA match. Hence, MMA fighters who want to last longer and do not want to end up getting easily exhausted must undergo strict MMA conditioning.<br /><br />Many beginners are often under the misconception that fighting with a number of opponents will help them improve their skills and make them a good MMA fighter. Beginners are either simply not aware how necessary conditioning is for them or just ignore the fact that they need to condition their body. Getting in the ring will certainly help amateur MMA fighters to learn a new technique and improve their skills, however, they soon wear themselves out and eventually get knocked out or submitted. For any MMA fighter, whether a beginner or a pro, building endurance and strength is essential.<br /><br />Cardiovascular conditioning and muscle conditioning are two programs that are highly needed in mixed martial arts, and a MMA fighter should focus on undergoing both these types of MMA conditioning.<br /><br />Cardiovascular MMA Conditioning<br /><br />When it comes to MMA training, cardiovascular conditioning and muscle endurance training are two very different types of conditioning. The typical forms of cardiovascular exercises that can be performed by mixed martial artists include biking, running, etc, while caveman fitness drills can be performed to improve muscle endurance. For example, pushing a sled or hitting a tire with a sledgehammer would prove well for increasing muscle endurance. MMA fighters can even do cone drills or box jumps, which are known as plyometric exercises.<br /><br />Strength MMA Conditioning<br /><br />When it comes to strength conditioning, low weight high rep training is the most ideal option. Using the many major muscles groups is necessary for mixed martial artists and they should undergo Olympic-style weight training. MMA fighters should perform, not only bench presses, dead lifts, and squats, but also low weight, high rep circuit exercieses. Exercises like pull-ups and pushups are excellent. MMA training programs should use kettlebells and sandbags. Even if MMA fighters end up exhausting a single part of their body, it can turn out to be quite devastating for them. Therefore, performing full-body exercises is the best thing they can do. A combination of the cardiovascular and muscle endurance strength conditioning exercises can substantially increase the endurance and strength of a mixed martial artist.<br /><br />Joining a professional gym is a good choice for those who want to enroll into an MMA conditioning program. In a setting like this, the fighters are able to receive guidance from a professional trainer, while their performance and progress is constantly being monitored. MMA conditioning can certainly consume a lot of time, however, to become a good MMA fighter it is necessary.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0hhZWJ6b2tlbEh1ZHNoZW9uLm5ld3N2aW5lLmNvbS9fbmV3cy8yMDEyLzA5LzEwLzEzNzcwNjg1LWhvdXN0b24ta2lja2JveGluZw__" target="_blank">Houston martial arts</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmNvbXBhbnkuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9MTg3MTg4MQ__" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21ham9ybWVycml0dDcxLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83Njc4MDIzMTkvaG91c3Rvbi1tYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMv" target="_blank">Kids Karate Houston</a>

Maybe you just want to learn the art of mixed martial arts. You may want to know a few things before you get started with your MMA classes. You will want to do a little research on the subject before you just go to the first MMA gym to start MMA classes. Many people may just want a unique style of training. Most MMA gyms have many different instructors, from many different disciplines, to help you in your training.<br /><br />When you first start your search for MMA classes you will want to ask yourself and your potential trainer some questions to know exactly what you will be learning and how they will be training you. You need to know exactly what it is that you want to learn, hand to hand combat, self defense, or training for competition. A trained martial arts instructor will be able to help guide you in this process.<br /><br />If you are wanting to train for competition, then the MMA classes that you are seeking will probably be different than the training of someone who is just looking for self defense lessons. If you have had formal training in the past and are looking for MMA training then you may want to find the right instructors for the form of martial arts you are to be practicing. While MMA means Mixed Martial Arts, you may want formal training in a discipline that is different form the one that you have already been formally trained in, such a Brazilian jiu jitsu and maybe you have had form muay thai training in the past, for example.<br /><br />The MMA as an art is been adopted by many police and military agency to formally train their personnel for the streets or for combat. That is what makes MMA classes a great form of self defense. An MMA instructor will teach you not only the how to survive the fight but as well how to win. The MMA approach is used by law enforcement agencies around the world because it works well to teach personnel the best submission techniques and self defense.<br /><br />The military has been using the MMA martial arts disciplines as their basis for military combat training for years. This is largely due to the fact that MMA teaches many disciplines. You will learn a full approach to the art of self defense when you go for MMA classes.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzQwMTc2OSZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03NjI1MDAwJmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9bWFqb3JtZXJyaXR0NzE3JmFtcDt1c2VyX2lkPTc2MjUwMDAmYW1wO3VzZXJuYW1lPW1ham9ybWVycml0dDcxNw__" target="_blank">Kids martial arts classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21pY2hlbGZvcnJlczYxNC5qaWdzeS5jb20vZW50cmllcy9nZW5lcmFsL0hvdXN0b24tbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLTI_" target="_blank">Houston MMA</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmNvbXBhbnkuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWljaGVsZm9ycmVzNjE0JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9MTg2MTU3Mg__" target="_blank">Click here</a>

Mouth guards now come customisable in different colours and designs, some even with teeth printed on the front to scare your opponent.<br /><br />2) Gloves<br /><br />This may seem like an obvious piece of MMA gear in the world of boxing however there are many different makes, colours etc. making it that bit easier to tailor them to suit your personality.<br /><br />3) Punching Bag<br /><br />This is a great piece of MMA training gear to incorporate into your training, whether you're a professional fighter or not.

Many common people are interested in mixed martial arts workouts as it promises to keep you in shape and give extra strength.<br /><br />Begin with warm up exercises. They should be light ones like sprints, skipping, pushups etc. Then gradually try to improve your cardio. Running is considered an excellent exercise for this purpose. If you are not a regular runner, then start slow at first. Do not force yourself for more than two to five miles a day. Increase your speed slowly but steadily. Don't overwork on the first day and then sit on bed for the next whole week. Then use some body weight exercises and free weights.<br /><br />Buy a heavy bag for yourself to practice your kicks and punches. Also work your knees and elbows on them. If a friend of yours is also interested in mixed martial arts workouts, or if you have someone as capable as you are, then try boxing with him. Focus on your defense more at first. Required materials like gloves must be worn.<br /><br />Usually gyms have all the required equipment, but if proper equipment are unavailable, you can still carry out your work out by using household items. Like for the dips, use a pair of chairs. You don't have to spend large sums of money to keep yourself fit. You might probably have few of these already in your homes like the skipping rope and heavy bags. Buy an ab wheel or just do crunches, the wheel however is good for your upper body and shoulders as well. Resistance bands could also be bought. They work on upper and as well as lower body. Another fruitful investment could be in buying an exercise ball. These equipment are not only inexpensive but are easily available almost everywhere.<br /><br />Apart from these exercises, take care of what you are eating. Strictly avoid junks and alcohols. Go for proteins and it is better if you eat meat and fish as a protein source. Have sufficient water and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. These workouts would not fully benefit you unless your diet is proper. You can take wholegrain foods, pulses and dairy products. If you want to stay fit, then get all the proper nutrients your body might need. I always recommend MMA supplements to my new fighters. It helps them recover as fast as possible and get the best possible workouts in the shortest time. There is a new supplement class on the market that was designed specifically for MMA fighters called a neural-adaptogen. If you can find a product like this, buy it!<br /><br />Never forgot to keep training hard, eating right, and getting in the best supplements. By doing this we may even one day see you in the octagon.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2dyb3Vwcy5kaWlnby5jb20vZ3JvdXAvanR4aXVubWdrYXFoeWtoYXlqZXAvY29udGVudC9ob3VzdG9uLWtpY2tib3hpbmctNjM0NDI0Ng__" target="_blank">Kids Karate classes Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VrQ2FybnVtYWhvcmFuS3lsYS5uZXdzdmluZS5jb20vX25ld3MvMjAxMi8wOS8xMC8xMzc3MDk2NS1ob3VzdG9uLW1tYQ__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21pY2hlbGZvcnJlczYxNC5kbXVzaWMubmV0L2pvdXJuYWwvMTUwNTU1OA__" target="_blank">This site</a>

However, when fighters go through winning phases, most don't think about mind coaching; many believe that mind coaching is only for those who have problems of nerves, insecurity, lack of confidence or any other psychological issue which may be preventing them from winning. Once an athlete has worked with a mind coach once, he or she quickly understands the benefits and the importance of doing so.<br /><br />Working with a mind coach is a small part of the training camp of an athlete, it has an influence just like every other part of the MMA training has but it is not going to guarantee wins; Chuck Liddell lost one of his most important fights even though he prepared mentally by working with Anthony Robbins (probably the best mind coach ever existed). In MMA nothing can guarantee victory but many things can guarantee defeat. Not working on your mind-fitness is one of those just like not working on your boxing, wrestling or any other discipline.<br /><br />Mind coaching is especially important for the post fight phase; in case of victory, it is important to help the athlete refocus on a new task ahead, remain humble, grow (physically and mentally) and &quot;reset&quot; the buttons. In case of defeat mind coaching can help athletes in a very big way. Not to console them or make them feel better about the fight gone not as planned, but rather the opposite.<br /><br />This is the time when a good mind coach should help the athlete learn as much as possible from the loss and become a better fighter. This is often overlooked by coaches and sometimes, obviously unintentionally, coaches and team-mates cause more damage by making up or putting up with various excuses; &quot;the matt was slippery&quot;, &quot;the ref was bad&quot;, &quot;the opponent threw illegal shots&quot;, &quot;was out for too long&quot;, &quot;the gloves where poor quality&quot; and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />The problem here is that when a fighter makes excuses for the loss, which is a defense mechanism to protect one's self esteem, deep inside he or she knows full well that these are excuses; they know it and try to overwrite this awareness although this is impossible to accomplish. When a team-mate or coach agrees with the athletes on the excuses, deep inside the athlete knows that the agreement is only an act of compassion which in turn makes the athlete feel even worse about the defeat. This is often unidentified by the conscious awareness and it gets interpreted as frustration, disappointment, sadness and sometimes even depression or simply a feeling of not being good enough.<br /><br />If the athlete (as well as the coaches and team-mates) can avoid making any excuse (even when the matt was indeed slippery and the ref was really bad), then the only task in hand would be to improve and do better. If you don't apply this you will lose twice every time you lose!<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21pY2hlbGZvcnJlczYxNC5qaWdzeS5jb20vZW50cmllcy9nZW5lcmFsL0NsaWNrLWhlcmU_" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/merrittmajor/blog/blogid=11878155" target="_blank">This site</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmNvbXBhbnkuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP3VzZXI9bWljaGVsZm9ycmVzNjE0JmFtcDtibG9nZW50cnlfaWQ9MTg2MTY3OA__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>
