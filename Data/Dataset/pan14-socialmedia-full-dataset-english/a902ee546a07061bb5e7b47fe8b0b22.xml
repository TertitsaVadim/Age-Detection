First, I was so busy with work. Second, I have a cousin and her friend staying with me temporarily. My time has been taken to make them more comfortable and at home. Interestingly, having them around made me appreciate my privacy and my loneliness. Third, I've been running around - my brother has a daughter now, my cousin got pregnant, and my sister now in Uni. Whatever time left I have on my hand I focused on them. Fourth, I've been writing again. I'm writing episodes 25-40 of Duranni (it's shown on Astro). Frankly, I've not seen the episodes yet although my sister said that it's kinda good. Lastly, finally I bring myself to exercise....yep..... 2 yoga classes per week. My body is now more flexible than 1 month ago..hahaha...
<br /><br />Anyways, last 18th July was my birthday. I declared it as my public holiday. So after 9.30 am I did not logon to my computer. I spent one whole day with my cousin. We watched movie and had a nice dinner at Fasta Pasta (my favourite restaurant). It was almost a perfect day.  
<br /><br />What is my resolution? Be thankful....eat well,  read more, exercise, be close to Allah, love my family more, laugh with my friends more often, and may be..... open my heart for love. If I'm not going to live until my next year's birthday, I'd like to know that I've lived well and loved people around me unconditionally. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Every Hari Raya, our Muslim friends will use a greeting so simple in its execution, many forget its significance. The greeting 'maaf zahir batin' which translatesloosely to 'I seek forgiveness (from you) physically and spiritually' for Hari Raya means a time to reconcile and renew relationships with others.
<br /><br />Forgiveness is something we should all practise. Not just for Hari Raya but every day. We should celbrate it and embrace it as an essential part of our lives.
<br /><br />There is nothing so bad that cannot be forgiven. Hurt will never heal until you forgive.
<br /><br />If you are at war with others, you cannot be at peace with yourself. You can let go and forgive. It takes no physical strength to let go, only courage.
<br /><br />Forgiveness is the single most important process that can bring peace to our souls and harmony to our lives. Forgiveness is not something we have to strain ourselves to do. Forgiveness helps you move forward. No one benefits from the forgiveness more than one who forgives.
<br /><br />Give yourselves the gift of forgiveness today. Maaf zahir batin to all.
<br /><br />&quot;The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi

I'll take it  that there will be a lot of blessing that Allah is sending down upon us together with it. May each and everyone of us will have our wishes come true.
<br /><br />What do you guys think about Hero TV series? I like Hiro the best...very enthusiastic with his power. Gang-gang andalus babes had downloaded the entire season and had watched it in Hero Marathon using projector...! Anyone want any spoiler?
<br /><br />Tomorrow is Friday..yeay!!! What shall I do for this weekend? Gang-gang sumer busy packing to move to new house. Maybe I should re-paint my house. Note to self...need to go to Jotun the Curve to get the paint. Also need to buy the thing to remove the wallpapers. 
<br /><br />For those who wanted to put up wall-papers... It's easy to put them up..but it's harder to put them down. After almost 4 years having them..I'm quite tired of it and wanted to have the Zen look in my house. 
<br /><br />That's it for today. To all...live well ..laugh a lot..! ZASSSSSSSSSSSSSS.

		<document id="289af1fd34a54d235194ff4c0dbdb9ed" url=""><![CDATA[TGIF<br/><br/>Friday is here...  last day of the working day for the week, the king of the week, as referred by muslims. It has been a bitter sweet and to a certain extent, a struggling week for me. This week is the first time I'm living by myself after my cousin moved out to join his hubby whom she newly wed last Sunday. 
<br /><br />I thought I'll enjoy the space as I can have all the apartment to myself now. Plus, this is the first time I'm not answerable to anyone on what time I'll come home everyday, I don't have to crack my head on what to eat for dinner which need to suit both mine and her requirements, I don't have to bother that someone will nag me that my laundry is not folded after 2 days it's dried. I don't have to cringe that the house was not kept according to my standard. I also can escape all the fights that my things are misplaced by her. 
<br /><br />But the emptiness she left overweighed the freedom of being alone and independent. While decorating her rooms for the nikah, I playfully teased her that at last, I can get rid of her from my life. In fact I sang her the song &quot;At last&quot; which I put in some words to make it relevant to us. We laughed at it but on the day I came home the reality hit.  
<br /><br />So there's a truth in what the wisemen say. You won't appreciate things until it's lost. While I can get used to not having the nagging from her.. but I missed all the little things like fighting over TV channel (as she is an ESPN, StarSports viewer while I'm more a Starworld &amp; AXN fan..and usually I have to lost my favourite programme to her Soccer/tennis game), the talks or bitching sessions, and the ability to look into each other and laugh as we know what is going on each other's head (usually happen when we are looking at certain people on the street who act weird...)
<br /><br />Although the house is now kept according to my requirement, and I can tell where are my things now...but I think having certain things  misplaced once in a while is not a bad thing after all.........
<br /><br />To Kak Faz, Selamat pengantin baru. Miss you like hell .. and forever love you. You're the best sis that anyone could ask for!
<br /><br />To all...live well..laugh a lot!

<br /><br />This is more difficult that what I expected. The good news is I've completed stripping of the wall paper from one of the bedrooms. The bad news is..that is the smallest room. Anyways, a journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step ..(trying to be optimistic... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/mellow.gif" alt=":)" /> )
<br /><br />Need to rest..as I start work at 6pm today. Till then.... live well everyone..adios...

It's good to catch up with old acquaintance. I like this friend a lot and I admire her courage, passion and persistence in re-uniting old friends.
<br /><br />Actually I got to know her very close when I was in form 5. After SPM we still keep in touch during the break while waiting the result. Once the result out, I continued my studies in Malaysia while she went abroad. Eventhough we tried to keep in touch, but we were defeated by time and distance.
<br /><br />On my 2nd-3rd year working, I got an e-mail in my hotmail who asked me whether I'm the person that she went to school with. She just managed to locate me by searching in hotmail address book (we used to be able to do that before....)
<br /><br />Since then we make a point to see each other may be at least once a year ( <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" />  better than not seeing each other at all) and always get connected via YM. 
<br /><br />Other than me..she has been contacting some other school friends and had been initiating reunions etc. Seriously, if not because of her, I don't think I will spend time to get reconnected with old friends. La... you're a good friend... Love always

While my body clock had went berzerk with the new working hours( fyi..mon/tue i work 9pm to 6 am, wed/thu i'm on 3pm-11.3pm shift and working normal biz hours on fri), i kinda enjoy the freedom of having the time for myself during day time. Just imagine on Monday morning...while people slugging and dragging themselves to office, I can either still on my bed, do some reading, run errands, or even had a lazy morning at mamak stall. Such a bliss! And ladies...to have a mall only to yourself is like HEAVEN!
<br /><br />I had a friend whose mission is to become a matchmaker for me (good luck to him!). He mentioned to me yesterday that to find somebody who is available to date me according to my time...it's quite a challenge for him..may be pak guard boleh la kot. Apa la Zam...? I kena tukar vendor la... Dah la tak creative...asyik tak meet quota je. Alih2 kita pulak yang ditanya dah jumpa Mr Right ke belum. I thought I dah outsource kat you!!!
<br /><br />OK lah..enough for today. To all...wish me luck. Hopefully, the cut-over for the 2nd wave of operations will be successful this Monday. Insya Allah...
<br /><br />Lastly..as usual... live well, love much...laugh a lot.

<br /><br />Firstly , there were 2 open houses. The food..yummy!!!
<br /><br />Second, my cousin sister drove all the way from Seremban to visit me. We missed each other so much. Marriage did her good. She looked happy and calm. I wish all the happiness in the world for her..I really do. When she left, she took all my cats with her...all of them - Kinchan, Joey, Snowy, and Phoebe. I hope the cats will love the new home..with the bigger space and nice lawn etc. Mummy will visit you guys...
<br /><br />Lastly, the andalus babes moved to a new pad!!!! I'm going to take opportunity to wish all my andalus babes who had moved to a new HQ!! I hope all the sores and aches will go away as soon as possible. 
<br /><br />Some private message to the babes:
<br />&quot;Pindah-pindah jugak..tapi jangan lupa the roaster tu. Nanti walhasil balik asal....if you know what I mean.
<br /><br />Eh Noe..ko kecoh yek orang ada banyak masa sekarang? What to do... lumrah la tu. Sekejap kita kat atas sekejap kita kat bawah..sekarang ni giliran aku yang ada masa...MUAAAHAHAHAH...jangan jeles.
<br /><br />Anways, I'm looking forward to the housewarming party. Setakat nak suruh aku bawak buah ke..kuih ke...kalau nak suruh beli lauk cam tu pun..OK je. &quot;
<br /><br />To the rest, I'm still at room 2 in stripping down the wall-paper. It got slowed down due to my back-ache after I fell down. This is what I will be doing this week. Hopefully the house will be all nice and cool by this weekend.
<br /><br />Thanks for those who writing in to me. To Huda who is studying in Ireland... study hard. Will keep you updated on what happened in Malaysia so that you don't miss us <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/w00t.gif" alt=":)" />

I was working from home today and around 1.30 pm when the tremor happened I was running my errands at TTDI. Hence, I don't feel anything. My friends called me and informed that there was power failure in BU and a friend in Cyberjaya mentioned that they can feel the tremble. 
<br /><br />Let's pray for those affected in Sumatera and may Allah's blessing will be with them.

<br /><br />Is it me or it's really warm nowadays? Human...when it's raining, you wish that the sun comes out..and when it's warm..you wish that it's raining... Sigh... Human is a species that is so difficult to please.
<br /><br />4 minutes to 11.30. Can't wait to go home and wash my hair. Hopefully it'll reduce the pain...
<br /><br />For American Idol fans.... who do you think will be the winner this year? My bet is on the ladies this year!

Punctuality, respect for individuals, honesty, ownership and responsibility are basic things which I feel should be part of way of life. 
<br /><br />I don't get it when people just come to work or meeting late without feeling any guilt. I don't understand when people make mistake and finger point. I don't know why people cannot be truthful.. What went wrong? Poor upbringing? Lack of education ..or simply stupid?
<br /><br />When I look at this stupidos (what I called for those ppl with no ethics).. I always look at them with amazement. I wonder how their brain works. Lack of neurons? Lack of vitamin? Lack of blessing from God? 
<br /><br />Hmmmmmmmmm ..one of life wonders.

<br /><br />Phoebs and Joey loved the new place and enjoying being the king and queen of the house. Kinchan had gone out a night before and have not came back and I managed to catch Snowy only after she came back home around Maghrib..and she smelt like fish (I hope she did not go and steal fish from the neighbours).
<br /><br />I had a good talk with my cousin sis last Saturday. Unfortunately I had to head back to KL that night. I reached KL around 9.30pm, ate dinner with Andalus babes and we started the Heroes marathon until 5 am. I finished watching the series until Chapter 18...the episodes that was aired in the US last week. You want to know what happened in Chapter 18..... Peter Petrelli met Sylar!!! What happened to him...? Watch yourself!!! Ha ha ha ha <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> .
<br /><br />This week we are going to do Ugly Betty's marathon or maybe Prison Break. Now you tell me I don't have a life? You guys are so wrong!
<br /><br />That's it from me today. I'm tired as I've been up since 7 this morning. To all, live well and love much....

She asked me, &quot;Quick..what burger will make you happy?&quot; I said, &quot;Duh... all burger make me happy, if they are delicious&quot;. She replied, &quot;C'mon humour me.... what burger will make US happy?&quot;. So I said, &quot; I don't know... Mc Donalds...?&quot;. And my mom happily said that, &quot;Silly you.... it won't make you that happy..!&quot;. About now I lost my patience, &quot;Cepat la Ma... what is the answer..?&quot;, which she replied...&quot; The burger that will make us happy is BERGEMBIRA&quot;... Wassup with that?????!!! 
<br /><br />So I know that she has good news for me. So I asked her about my little sister's SPM result.And my mom told me she scored 8 As and 3Bs. Good for her. And she scored A1s for Maths, Add Maths and Accounts!!! Geee.... how nerd can she be? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> Sorry Kak Chik ..lawak je ...

And our usual activity will be karaoke at BSC and followed by supper at Bangsar. This is a routine that we do once in 2-3 months. 
<br /><br />We sing our heart out during the karaoke session (and mind you..the taste of music is so so so different from one another, one old timer, one techno - like Aqua, one indonesian song lover, and one contemporary) and pour our frustration on the work, life, family, marriage, etc during supper. Usually the married ones have to get visa from their hubby for the session as we usually finish around 2-3am.
<br /><br />I can't wait for tonight. While this week is not such a bad one, I just need to let my hair down with people that I'm really really comfortable with. 
<br /><br />Wishing all of you a nice and wonderful weekends.

		<document id="5c07acddf985c8c129ef791b7ee6790e" url=""><![CDATA[The gift of tears<br/><br/>Early this morning I accidentally switched to channel TV3. This psychologist was talking about crying as a therapy.  It shocked me when she said that a person who cries a lot is balanced. He he he <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> . Actually, I have considered myself as an emotionally unstable person since I can cry even on small things. 
<br /><br />I cry watching all sad movies and even not so sad movies. I cried everytime I saw how Meredith Grey sufferred in Grey's Anatomy. At one point, my cousin used to put her finger on my cheek everytime there's sad scene on TV/cinema, to check whether my tears spilled over. And I'm so ashamed to reveal that I sobbed fiercefully watching Lion King.. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> until the person who sits next to me looked as if I'm a psychopath.
<br /><br />Then, I cried when I lost my dear ones. I cried when I lost my grandma. At age 9, when I sat myself next to her in the center of the living room where she was placed unconsiously, I called her name and cried. And you know what.. I made the entire kampung cried with my act <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/blushing.gif" alt=":)" /> . I also cried when I lost Chandler, my dearest cat. I sobbed so hard that I thought I'll lost my breath. I read my last prayers for him (and Yassin too) before carrying him to my aunt's house in Seremban. I put him on my lap while my cousin drove us back and I cried all the way to Seremban. Until now, 1 year after his death, I still mourn over the loss and missed him hiding in my blanket while I was asleep.
<br /><br />Then again, the therapist could have been right. According to a hadith, the prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) proclaimed: &quot;This (tears) is an expression of the tenderness and compassion, which the Lord hath put into the hearts of His servants. The Lord doth not have compassion on and commiserate with His servants, except such as are tender and full of feeling.&quot; 
<br /><br />So if balanced it is...... I'll accept it with humbleness....

<br />I've paid a price, and i'll keep paying
<br /><br />I'm not ready to make nice,
<br />I'm not ready to back down,
<br />I'm still mad as hell

<br />Why can't you just get over it,
<br />It turned my whole world around
<br />and i kind of like it
<br /><br />I made by bed, and I sleep like a baby,
<br />With no regrets and I don't mind saying,
<br />It's a sad sad story
<br />That a mother will teach her daughter
<br />that she ought to hate a perfect stranger.
<br />And how in the world
<br />Can the words that I said
<br />Send somebody so over the edge
<br />That they'd write me a letter
<br />Saying that I better shut up and sing
<br />Or my life will be over
<br /><br />I'm not ready to make nice,
<br />I'm not ready to back down,
<br />I'm still mad as hell

Time needed for a breather, to have chance to analyse things objectively without having a need to go into fights and heart aches; an opportunity to remedy pain.. a chance to think about the future - to still fight for the marriage or to let it go.
<br /><br />For those who are still dating..they take a break. This path sometime lead to reconciliation but to some it leads to further distance of two hearts.
<br /><br />But what happened if true friendship is tested? When the respect is diminishing and the trust is draining? When 99% of the time, good intentions are misintepreted? When your sincerity is always questioned? When accusation becomes the language rather than compliment? Can the 2 friends stand stedfastly to the friendship that they have been successfully hold on for years?
<br /><br />My dear friend and I decided that we need to take a break from each other for 2 months. This break is much needed before our relationship getting worsen and beyond save. 
<br /><br />Remember when we are young and we used to get FRANCE in our autograph? Well if this friendship is truely meant to last.. I do hope what I got from my autograph will come into reality - Friendship Remains And Never Can End....... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/angel.gif" alt=":)" />

<br /><br />Watched American Idol tonite and one of my favourites had been voted off. 
<br /><br />Also, my dearest friend has lost her cat. He is the father of my late Chandler. My heart goes to the mummy of Meowgi. I truly understand what you're going through and do hang on there. Just remember he is in a better place right now.

<br /><br />This song is dedicated to anyone who need to have a boost in their life. Keep smiling... a reminder to my self. Love you all...

<br /><br />Smile though your heart is aching;
<br />Smile even though it's breaking.
<br />When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by.
<br />If you smile through your fear and sorrow,
<br />Smile and maybe tomorrow,
<br />You'll see the sun come shining through for you.
<br /><br />Light up your face with gladness,
<br />Hide every trace of sadness.
<br />Although a tear may be ever so near,
<br />That's the time you must keep on trying,
<br />Smile, what's the use of crying?
<br />You'll find that life is still worthwhile,
<br />If you just smile.
<br /><br />That's the time you must keep on trying,
<br />Smile, what's the use of crying?
<br />You'll find that life is still worthwhile
<br />If you just smile

The blog is full of content and have very good materials. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyahumaira.wordpress.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://yahumaira.wordpress.com</a>
<br /><br />Below is the excerpt from the book titled &quot;Don't be Sad&quot; or in Arabic &quot;La Tahzan&quot; that was published in this blog. Praise to Allah for the peace that He bestowed upon us.
<br /><br />This wonderful words made want me to get the book. May what you read here could touch you as much as it touches me. Take care everyone...
<br /><br />**********************************
<br />To bow is to be like the willow, and to not return force is to be like the oak tree. The believer is like the green plant; the wind blows it to the left and to the right. The wise person is like water, for water does not crash into a rock, trying to pass through it. Instead, it comes to it from the left and from the right, from above and from below. The believer is like a camel whose reins are on its nose. If it were made to kneel on a rock, it would do so. Search for happiness inside of you and not around you or outside you. This life does not deserve our grief. O’ Allah, make me pleased with Your decree, so that I may know that whatever has befallen me was not meant to miss me and what has passed me by, was not meant to be in my lot. As long as you have faith in Allah, do not be sad. Faith in Allah, the Al-Mighty, is to happiness and peace while disbelief is to confusion and misery. The element that influences nature is the active intellect (Ibn Seena). By Allah I felt not your landing on me! Then how will I feel you when you fly away. The ideal person is he who takes pleasure in serving others, who is ashamed when others do things for him, since showing compassion is a sign of superiority, while receiving is a sign of failure (Aristotle).
