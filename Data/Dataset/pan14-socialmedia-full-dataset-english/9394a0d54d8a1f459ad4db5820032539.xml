Everybody is running after money—whether you are rich, in business or job, belong to any religion, caste or creed! The main goal is to get money as much as possible. It becomes essential for a person to earn that much of money to make his living respectful in society. How much can I get? Which are the methods or streams where I can earn more? What will happen to me financially after some years or in old age? Which areas of place will be suitable for me to become a successful person? Like this there are many questions which a person want answer. If someone predicts or foretells then the life would become much easier. One can put the effort in the right direction to be successful.  Here Astrology guides you the best. Astrology deciphers the position and potential of planets in a chart and the branch that deals with finances is known as astroeconomics – a branch of predictive astrology that deals with the financial matters- globally or personally. By the globally means predicting about the financial condition by country and the market trend that deals in stock and shares etc. and the matters that governs the money market in a country and in the broader sense world throughout. Personally, astrology guides in two methods- by the chart drawn for the person, company, business, country or any financial venture and the other is by the current position of planets known as transit- by which prediction can be made for hundred of years ahead. Positive and negative points and how to deal with them. 
<br /><br />When we discuss about the financial astrology of a person it helps the person in various ways by observing the planetary placements and their relations – that predicts the financial position of a person and how much is he able to rise in his life. It clearly foretells whether one is suitable for business or for job. From where a person is able to get more profits, where to invest and which area of work will be suitable and numerous other related queries related to finance.
<br /><br />The most important use is found for the teenagers or school going students when they want to select an educational or career stream for themselves. That is really a phase when the mind is confused- sometimes one get influenced by the trend going on and pick up the wrong stream where he cannot justify with his inner abilities to rise. But when the decision is once made can not be rectified – if it is taken a long time to amend it. 
<br /><br />The first house deals with the overall ‘Self’ of a person. It represents the whole personality of a person, his motivation and strength. 
<br />The second house deals with the funds or assets. 
<br />Third house deals with the effort, communications, short travel and also elementary school experiences.
<br />Fourth deals with the land, property concerns or real estates. 
<br />The fifth house shows the gains incurred due to the karmas done in the previous lives. It also holds gambling, financial speculation, stock and shares etc. 
<br />Sixth deals with debts and loss, environment and experiences at work. 
<br />Seventh holds for business partnerships, power issues and long travels. 
<br />Eighth house deals in money got without putting any effort like from insurance policies, inheritance, gifts, legacy. 
<br />Ninth is the house of luck and long journeys.
<br />Tenth is the house of karma governs career and social standing.
<br />Eleventh deals with the source of income of money and group efforts.
<br />Twelfth is for expenditure, loss, abroad or confinement.
<br /><br />As financial condition is life is affected not only by one factor in life likewise we can see that in a chart not one house of the chart governs finances. All are inter related to each other by one manner or the other. The most important use is found for the teenagers or school going students when they want to select an educational or career stream for themselves. That is really a phase when the mind is confused- sometimes one get influenced by the trend going on and pick up the wrong stream where he cannot justify with his inner abilities to rise. But when the decision is once made can not be rectified – if it is taken a long time to amend it. Mercury rules commerce whereas Jupiter gives business. Venus along with Moon makes one good in computer stream and strong Mars provides authority and when with Venus makes one a good surgeon. 
<br /><br />Sun with Mercury in the house of education gives inclination towards science or healing like medicines. Saturn with influence of Mars pushes towards engineering. Influence of malefic planets provides mechanical or technical stream. When the fifth house or ninth house [governs higher education] is connected with the tenth house then the person opts for the profession in which he has received the higher education or training. The tenth house of chart predicts the graph of the career. The overall planets and the Nakshatras ruling them. And the combinations in the chart reveal whether one is able to hold the business efficiently or not. Even if you are good in skills but that is not enough. One should possess the business streak- the sharp farsightedness – to hold and govern the business. The overall layout of the chart, the inter related position of the planets foretells the strength of chart whether is suitable for business or for job. The success and different phases in business are clearly predicted for years. Similar position can be held for job in chart. 
<br /><br />Sometimes a person do well at a certain place – as the potential of planets becomes stronger under some celestial influences where one can exhibit his talents and opportunities become wider than before. Therefore, it is then better judged by analyzing the birth chart that which place is suitable for profession or job. This field of astrology is better known as relocational astrology. It is now widely used to obtain better gains in life.
<br /><br />As you sow, so shall you reap – is justified in this section of astrology that deals with the aim that one should put in effort in the right direction where he is able to pour and receive the best from his environment. So that maximum results are achieved to become successful in life.

I remember a poem &quot;Vocation&quot; by Rabindranath Tagore where it is beautifully described about the mind of the child, about his thoughts for opting a profession when he grows up. Good guidelines regarding career proves to be a great blessing when one is going to chose an educational stream and equally when one is going to opt for professional stream. Where you can do the best and use your potential maximum. After entering into a career then many ups and downs are also felt and many times a total change in career direction is also observed due to any failure or great loss. If one is already prepared for all this then it become well convenient to handle the things. If you already know that in which stream your planets may yield much better then it is better to opt for training in that stream only so that you will be well equipped in your career stream. Astrology is found to be the best tool to guide you at the moment when you are in a fix. 
<br /><br />Career is judged primarily by the tenth house of the birth chart. The tenth house is a very important house of the birth chart. Since it gives identity and importance to a person in the society. Uttara Kalamrita narrates some more significations of the tenth house – Commerce, honour from the ruler, wrestling, work, service, agriculture, fame, hidden treasure, sacrifices, mantras and yantras, extensive religious merits, prosperity, right path, good living, authority, influence and a mind that gives orders to be obeyed. 
<br /><br />The significators of the tenth house are Sun, Mercury, Jupiter and Saturn.
<br />It is not only the tenth house by which a career is judged because it is a collective effort of every area of our life which leads to opting for a career like education. Good academic ability leads to a smooth career. Education is seen through the fourth house. It shows education gained in school. The fifth house shows knowledge gained after completion of education of school; whether it is in any institution or in an office or in any workplace. If the first, fourth, fifth houses are in good condition then it uplifts the tenth house. Good results are expected in their dashas.
<br /><br />Third house shows the mental inclination of a person. It also shows courage, profits and great undertakings. It shows enthusiasm in a person. Nothing is expected of a person with a weak third house. This means that the person lacks strength and enthusiasm in his life. If the third house is vacant then its sign is interpreted for ability of a person.
<br /><br />Ninth house is luck or fortune of a person. It also shows the employer of  a person. Relations between ninth and tenth houses show good fortune in career. Sixth house is ninth from the tenth house hence it is the luck of career.  Seventh house shows business partnerships and foreign travels whereas eleventh house denotes gains. The twelfth house shows relation with foreign countries, hospitals or jails. So it is seen that career of a person is not only judged through tenth house only; the whole chart is considered for it. It is the total observation of the chart which lead to interpretation of career. Each sign, planet and nakshatra  has its own significance in shaping up the career.
<br /><br />Career cannot be judged only by one planet only. It is blend of more than one planet -- the planet placed in the tenth house and the lord of the sign of the tenth house. The planet related to Sun ascendant and Moon ascendant should also be judged as well. The planet which is the strongest of all will influence the field of career more. Planets are divided into two categories:
<br />1. Technical planets 
<br />2. Non-technical planets
<br />1. Technical planets are those which make one inclined towards a technical stream. It is governed by Malefic planets Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu come under technical category.
<br />2. Non-technical planets are those which make a person work in the field other than mechanics or machines.  All benefic planets refers to non-technical category. Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus come under this category.  
<br /><br />Some career streams are a mixture of both technical and non-technical. In that case a good blend of both type of planets are seen. So, again it is emphasized here that never jump to conclusion based on one planet only. 
<br />Some simple steps for quick reference are given here to understand it much better.          Specific combinations are given for common career streams. 
<br />Architect: Ascendant favorable for architects are Leo, Scorpio, Cancer, Virgo and Libra. Planets indicating this career are Saturn, Mars and Mercury. 
<br />Athletes: Virgo and Sagittarius signs are favorable for athletes. Mars, Jupiter and Mercury signify this career. First, third and fifth houses are supporting for this combination. 
<br /><br />Arms and ammunition: Aries and Mars are seen prominent in the birth charts.
<br />Aviation: All airy signs, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, are favourable. Mercury, Sun and Jupiter are significant. Venus is also favourable.
<br /><br />Communication Department: This includes post and telegraph, courier services, wireless, radio, cellular phones, telephone operators, telephone booths etc. Gemini and Sagittarius both are favourable for this occupation. Mercury and Jupiter are significant and the relation of third house with the tenth is mostly observed.
<br />Doctors: Jupiter and Mars are seen prominent. Moon is mostly afficted in surgeons. Sixth house and twelfth house are seen active. Medical Practitioner may have second lord in the seventh house.
<br /><br />Dentists have Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn and Mars prominent in their charts. 
<br />Doctors: Jupiter and Mars are seen prominent. Moon is mostly afficted in surgeons. Sixth house and twelfth house are seen active. Medical Practitioner may have second lord in the seventh house.
<br /><br />Dentists have Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn and Mars prominent in their charts. 
<br />Photographers: Sun and Jupiter are seen to be prominent in photographers.
<br />Property Dealer: Mars, Venus and the fourth house are seen to be prominent.
<br />Policemen: Saturn, Mars and twelfth house is seen to be active. 
<br />Politicians: Sun, Mercury and Jupiter are strong in politicians. Tenth house is strong.
<br /><br />Teacher: Gemini, Virgo or Sagittarius signs are active. Sun, Moon and Jupiter are favourable. Ninth house and fifth house are seen active.
<br /><br />Further, astrology is also able to guide whether one is able to shine in job or business. Sometimes is observed that after gaining a good experience in job one does well in his own work. And sometimes a person is not fit for job but do excellent in business.  Saturn governs work- afflicted or weak Saturn makes you work under someone whereas strong Saturn gives you to rule over someone. Jupiter provides business ability. The role of Nakshatras in which planets are present are also very important to judge. Nakshatras of authoritative planets makes you good at business and gives you ability to hold the practicality of business. Only business sense is not enough - one should be competent to hold the inside and outside management both. Similarly, at job, if the planets are in non authoritative nakshatra are more- they will help to do the job easily- going on the rules set by your employer and find it easier to do. 
<br /><br />Other than that astrology also guide that which place is suitable for you for career purpose. 
<br /><br />Whatever the combinations hold in the chart for smooth sailing your good luck should be strong. But your karma - what you are doing right now is very much important. It is well known that the twelfth house of any house in the chart shows its loss. The house of destiny falls in the twelfth from the house of Karma- thus if your karmas are good and in the right direction - you will meet success. Just to know which direction and which type of karma - get help of astrological guidance and meet success.

Emperor Dasaratha performed Aswamedha sacrifice to procure children. Sage Valmiki indicates in Canto XVIII of Bala Kanda, that Sri Rama was born after about a year had passed from the date of the completion of Aswamedha sacrifice.
<br /><br />The Lord was born on the ninth lunar day of the bright fortnight of Chaitra, when the star Punarvasu was in the ascendant. The five planets (Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn) were in their respective exaltation positions. The Sun in the 10th degree of Aries, the Moon in the 3rd degree of Taurus, Mars in the 28th degree of Capricorn, Jupiter in the 5th degree of Cancer, Venus in the 27th degree of Pisces and Saturn in the 20th degree of Libra are the exalted positions. Jupiter and Moon are in conjunction in Cancer.
<br /><br />The three padams (quarters) of Punarvasu is located in Gemini, and the fourth padam is located in Cancer. As Jupiter is ex alted in Cancer and is in conjunction with Moon, it must be the fourth padam of Punarvasu at the time of birth of Sri Rama. The ascendant is Cancer. However, the actual year of birth is not furnished in Srimad Valmiki-Ramayana, other Vedic Scriptures or recognized Theological texts. Regardless of the year of birth of Lord Rama, the remarkable planetary positions shown in Sri Rama's horoscope can only occur once in many-many thousand years.
<br /><br />Prior to discussing Sri Rama's chart, one needs to carefully consider whether the classical principles of Vedic Astrology are applicable to God, who has incarnated as Sri Rama. As an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, Sri Rama was born on the earth in the form of a human. Unlike the rest of the human population, Sri Rama possessed divine qualities. While acknowledging with deep- humility, the divinity in Sri Rama, we will study the Lord's horoscope as that of an individual born on the earth.
<br /><br />Sri Rama's Horoscope is every astrologer's dream horoscope. It is important to recognize that the exaltation of five planets is par se extraordinary. It is no exaggeration to say that Sri Rama's horoscope is possibly the only in the world to have exaltation of five planets. Even recognized Classical Vedic astrology texts have clearly indicated that five or six exalted planets result in the person being an emperor or a mighty king.
<br /><br />Sri Rama is provide <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRhc3Ryby5jb20v" target="_blank">Indian Vedic Astrology</a> and horoscope reading of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmRhc3Ryby5jb20vYXN0cm9sb2d5LWFydGljbGVzL3JhbWEucGhw" target="_blank">Aries Horoscope, AsFree Aries trology Report</a> &amp; covering interpretation of birth chart astrology &amp; individual interpretation with all planets information with gemstone.

We will now have to understand the utility of Navamsa in diagnosing diseases. Basically each house stands for some portion of the human body and its strength and weakness are also assessed on the basis of Navamsa. If a planet occupies own house in Navamsa it is called swa-navamsa and is good. If it is in exalted house it is called Uchha Navamsa which is also good and if it occupies enemies house it is called Shatru Kshetra which is bad. The lord of the rasi who controls a certain portion of the body should be strong. This lord should be well placed to give strength to that portion of the body which he controls; else it indicates there is weakness in the said portion of the body. The Navamsa dispositor of the 6th house is also a planet which may cause the ailment. 
<br /><br />The 6th lord of the horoscope gives clues for the ailment one suffers in life. His Navamsa dispositor, if brought back into rasi chart to the place it occupies, that rasi is the indicator of ailment.
<br /><br />As an example, for Kanya ascendant (Virgo Ascendant) the 6th lord Saturn if occupying Thula (Libra) Navamsa Venus becomes the Navamsa dispositor of the 6th lord. In case he occupies Mithuna (Gemini) rasi the ailment will be connected with Mithuna and Dhanus (Sagittarius) because Venus aspects the fourth house. As Mithuna is an airy sign the ailment may be connected with breathing or lungs. The fourth house denotes Heart and chest complaints. In addition to the above we have to see the transit of planets in 64th Navamsa from the Moon Navamsa. In case malefics pass through this Navamsa health problems are indicated with risk to life.
<br /><br />To sum up we give the following points for the diagnosis and timing of the diseases: 
<br />Each of the 12 signs represents one part of the human body. 
<br />6th house represents the house of disease.
<br />To learn more, one has to study Navamsa, Drekkana and Rogamsa (D-6) and Dwadasamsa (D-12).
<br />Navamsa is a very important chart. 
<br />We have to identify the position of the 6th lord of the rasi chart in Navamsa and note down the lord of the sign. This planet is responsible for the disease, and timing of the ailment. He is called as Navamsa dispositor.
<br />The position of Navamsa dispositor in the rasi chart indicates the portion of the body affected. 
<br />In every horoscope, there is a beneficial planet called Yogi and a harmful planet called Avayogi. 
<br />Avayogi is also responsible for creating diseases according to its signification and position in the zodiac and if the controller is Avayogi of a planet that planet suffers.
<br />Cancer Diseases. 
<br />In this issue, we present horoscopes of different cancers of the body with their diagnosis that indicate different planets point to the different cancers.
<br />Note these:
<br />For Brain cancer, the Sun, ascendant lord and Mercury are looked into.
<br />For Bone cancer Sun and Mars are important.
<br />For Breast cancer Venus and Moon are considered.
<br />For Blood cancer Moon and Mars are crucial.
<br />Karakas for the brain, breast, bone and blood are to be studied with their strength and weaknesses.
<br />Vimshottari Dasa is used to pin point the timing of the disease/s.
<br />In all cases of Cancer ailments, the intervention of major planets like Saturn, Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter are of paramount importance.

Since Vedic astrology imbibes the rules of Vedic civilization, we also find vital clues to help us lead a virtuous &amp; harmonious life with our partner for life.  
<br /><br />Carrying out Vedic astrology compatibility is therefore a quest for finding a fulfilling life with the person you love with minimum stress &amp; maximum happiness. Best chances of finding a true soul mate exist with carrying out Vedic compatibility study.
<br /><br />Vedic texts give preference to family bonds and its strength. If relationships, of all sorts, are balanced then life becomes smooth itself. But how far is it possible? Difference in basic nature and responses make others behave differently at different situation. How the other person will react or how the life will go through the ups and downs and be together? Vedic Matching has no end for assessing it. [It not only analyzes the love relationships but also includes the compatibility in business or employer/employee relationship, relationship between siblings etc.]. Thus the Marital compatibility analysis is taken as prime and technically refined as it is Nakshatra based. It goes beyond the limit of signs/aspects – it is mostly Nakshatra based and importance of signs and comparative position of planets are also not ignored.
<br /><br />Zodiac belt is occupied by twelve signs that contain 27 nakshatras- constellations- hence more intricate than compatibility that is sign based only. As signs has their qualities and attributes likewise Nakshatras has. Each Nakshatra depicts nature in a very much refined form. The person born in that Nakshatra carries those qualities. Ready reckoner of ashta koota Milan is based on Nakshatra of the Moon sign only. It not only foretells about the nature- mental or sexual compatibility of the partners but also covers the areas related to finances, children, good luck for each other, emotional attachment for each other, health etc. Almost every area of life is covered in ashta koota Milan- however, is not ultimate. Ashta means eight and koota means factor. Each factor depicts flow of energy related to different areas of life. 
<br /><br />The eight factors are: 
<br />Vashya: means within control. This is related to ego of partners.
<br />Varna: related to caste. It indicates the nature of mutual affection between the partners.
<br />Tarabala: health and longevity.
<br />Yoni: biological and sexual compatibility. 
<br />Grahmaitri: It indicates mental and intellectual compatibility.
<br />Gana: it indicates prosperity and behavior. This is important for those who run business.
<br />Bhakoota: It is taken for financial and professional support.
<br />Naadi: it is taken for internal metabolism and hereditary factors. 
<br /><br />The minimum points required for matching the charts are 18 without any dosha and the maximum are 36.  
<br /><br />Matching from 18-21 is generally considered an Average Match. This category requires lot of adjustments from both the sides. Other factors of horoscope should also be considered.
<br />Matching from 22-26 is considered as Fair Match. Matching from 27-32 is generally considered as Good Match. Many other doshas are reduced in this category. Matching above 32 points is considered as an Excellent Match.  However, matching of 36 points indicates complete matching of charts and indicates too much or polarity and mirror imaging of each other that may sometimes become difficult to adjust. Therefore practically the category between 27-34 is very good for marital harmony.
<br /><br />Apart from that the major factor to be considered is Manglik dosha. It is also known as kuja dosha or chevvai dosham also. Presence of Mars in the 1-4-7-8-12 houses in the birth lagna known as to cause manglik dosha. According to many other experts 2nd house is also considered. 
<br /><br />Any malefic planet that affects the seventh house mars the longevity and happiness of conjugal bliss. Since other malefic planets are not as much harmful as Mars thus presence of Mars that affects the seventh house and also eighth house is considered more than any other planet. The similar malefic presence of planet as similar in the partner’s chart cancels this dosha. Therefore, the matching of the charts according to Manglik dosha consideration is not ignored at all.
<br /><br />Mars dosha is also assessed by Moon and also by Venus Lagna as these two planets plays important role in marital life. However, the effect of these lagnas differs and also the effect of mars dosha in these three lagnas. Besides these important factors the presence and their cancellation both are to be considered comparatively and assessed well.
<br /><br />To know about your own personal compatibility you should also know the date, time and place of birth of the partner.

See detailed <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indastro.com%2Findianastrology%2Fnavratri"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.indastro.com/indianastrology/navratri</a></strong>
<br /><br />The recitation of Durga Stuti holds great importance during navratri when the series of chapters are read by two methods- Tryangam and Navangam. Tryangam consists of reading three prayers viz Devi Kavacham, Devi argalam and Devi keelakam followed by meditation and chanting of the Navakshari manthra  - “Om Iym hreem kleem Chamundayai , viche namah”.
<br /><br />Navangama means nava- nine and angam means body [literally] and consists of nine stotras where nine prayers are recited before starting reading of the holy book. They are chanting of 1.Nyasa 2.Avahana 3. Namani 4. Argala 5. Keelaka 6. Hrudaya 7. Dhala 8. Dhyana and 9. Kavacha. It is recommended that the entire Devi Mahatmya should be read in one sitting. However, if one cannot, then the chapters are divided accordingly.
<br /><br />Ist Day- Chapter 1
<br />IInd Day- Chapters 2, 3 and 4
<br />IIIrd Day- Chapters 5 &amp; 6
<br />IVth Day- Chapter 7
<br />Vth Day- Chapter 8
<br />VIth Day- Chapters 9 and 10
<br />VIIth Day- Chapters 11
<br />VIIIth Day- Chapter 12
<br />IXth Day- Chapter 13
<br /><br />After completion of the reading it is necessary to chant the Devi Suktham consisting of the slokas 7 to 36 of chapter 8.
<br /><br />You can conclude the recitation on the ninth day or the tenth day of Ramnavami  by recitation of Devi Apradha Kshama prarthna. 
<br /><br />Recitation of Siddha Kunjika Stotra should also be done after each recital. And the prayer devoted to the day of that Goddess of the nine Goddess should be performed.
<br /><br />Nine forms of Goddess:
<br /><br />The first day is devoted to Maa Shailputri- means daughter of mountains. She represents Sati- the wife of Lord Shiva, who could not tolerate the insult of husband and burnt herself in the fire of Yagna. In her next  birth she became the daughter of Himalaya in the name of Parvati or Shailputri. She is adorned by a halfmoon and rides the bull Nandi. She carries Spear in her hand. Maa Shailputri represents power i.e. Shakti.

The popularity of horoscopes can be gauged from the fact that in almost all newspapers, magazine and, websites, search engines and portals a section is dedicated to daily, weekly or monthly horoscopes.
<br /><br />Horoscopes are an important element of the science of astrology. It is significant because people from different countries, beliefs and cultures read it all over the world every day and some even follow it in their daily life in everything they do. Horoscope is the interpretation of the chart that represents the planets and their positions in the solar system at the time of our birth.
<br /><br />There are different types of horoscopes based of different branches of astrology and they may have different meanings because of a number of ways of presenting them or studying them. While the ones based on sun signs is probably the most commonly found and the most popular currently, we will discuss Indian Vedic Horoscopes today. Vedic Astrology on which Indian Vedic horoscopes are based is not only older but more accurate
<br /><br />It is estimated that the system of Indian Vedic astrology is almost 5000 years old today and has been carried down from generations. It is perhaps the oldest method of foreseeing into the future known to us today. Indian Vedic horoscope has helped many people predict their future events and incidents, happy and difficult periods and take remedial action wherever and whenever possible.
<br /><br />Many ancient scriptures like the Vedas and Puranas written thousands of years ago mention Vedic Astrology. A unique system of predictions and calculations is followed by Vedic Astrology to Create the Horoscope. Western or sun sign astrology takes into account the position of the sun at the time of your birth and the predication are based on this system .However in Vedic Astrology predictions are based on the Moon sign that leads to a much more wide-ranging, personalized and precise Horoscope or prediction of the future.
<br /><br />There are 12 signs in the zodiac and therefore everyone is born is divided into 12 equal division according to their date of birth in the other branches of astrology. This leads to a more generalized and less accurate horoscope. In Vedic Astrology  the moon sign is used as a basis to divided people into 12 different section and this is further sub divided into 9 sections thus making the calculations more fine tuned and accurate. Not only are the zodiac signs classified according to constellations or 'Nakshatras' as it is called in Sanskrit, The placement of the planets is also considered from these constellations. 
<br /><br />If you would like to ascertain your moon sign you will need to know your date of birth, along with the time you were born and where you born. The moon sign is generally different from the sun sign and there an Indian Vedic Horoscope will vary form the sun sign prediction considerably.

It predicts the doomsday- mayan calendar ends on Sunday, December 23, 2012. According to it a great catastrophe is expected. Only a few people will survive. Is it true- or not? Still it is a big question. When everything is concerned with people massively then itself drags attention. According to Mayan calendar, the Earth will be destroyed by cataclysmic astronomical events.
<br />. 
<br />Many questions arise from this prediction. According to sources the Mayan calendar ends here. There is no record of any prediction. What will really happen is still in doubt. Why Mayan calendar has not provided further possible happenings- it is an exhaustive work and maybe depends on the coming generation to continue it! Or the world is really going to an end. There were many rumors like this earlier too. 
<br /><br />According to information from Wikipedia given -- The essentials of the Maya calendar are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 5th century BCE. Was the map of Earth complete at that time? Many places were yet to be explored then. Many civilizations grew later on. Many times people of the earth go through loss of millions and millions of lives in many catastrophes. Was the calendar correctly based on astronomy that may describe the time or place where it could happen? Technically - was it sound and well equipped? There is no doubt that Mayans had amazing sense of mathematics and astronomy but limitations also existed. 
<br /><br />The Mayan’s operated on three separate calendars, and their method of keeping track of time was very long and complicated. The first one was the Haab calendar – for civil purpose, second-the Tzolkin used for ceremonial purpose and the third the Long Count used for historical purpose. 
<br /><br />According to the different sources The Mayan calendar predicts that astronomical occurrences are predicted to take place on December 21, 2012, such as the sun being aligned directly with the center of the Milky Way, or any other astronomical event that may create disruption on the earth on December 21, 2012 due to the alignment of the axis of the Earth could take place.
<br /><br />However, In <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indastro.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.indastro.com</a></strong> according to Vedic Astrology – If it is the month of kartika, amavasya [new moon] falls on Tuesday, Moon is in swati Nakshatra, Ayushman yoga exists then it is loss of living and non living objects.
<br /><br />During the kartik month and amavasya that is the new moon day is falling on 13th November 2012, then the Moon will be on Swati Nakshatra and the day is Tuesday but the yoga formed that day will be Saubhagya means one yoga ahead from Ayushman.  The loss is expected during that period. Though yoga is missing and Saubhagya yoga indicates the silver streak in dark. It suggests some catastrophe but that would not be certainly the end of the world. 
<br /><br />Now is expected any catastrophe, the chart drawn at the time of the kartik amavasya shows aspect of Saturn to Mars in fiery sign Sagittarius and the formation of eclipse in Libra suggest fire and storm. The Sanghatta Chakra- the astrological diagram to predict the catastrophe and possible areas of it – the sign Libra and Taurus are found to be afflicted though the triangle consists of Taurus, Libra and Aquarius. The places Tasmania, Cyprus, Ireland, Switzerland, Capri, Rhodes, the Greek Islands are ruled by Taurus. Libra governs Argentina, Austria, Burma, Canada, China, Japan, Siberia, Tibet and Aquarius governs Finland, Iran, Russia, Sweden, Syria, Ethiopia. Out of which the Libran countries are most afflicted in the chart. Therefore, the event is expected to happen in Libran countries. It would be event or many fateful events that may claim several lives in different days that may spread from two month before and after the eclipse formed on November 13th, 2012. 
<br /><br />When observed through korma chakra- an astrological diagram to know about the direction and places concerned the South, South West direction is afflicted by malefic. This indicates south west America, Mexico, North-West Argentina, Cuba  and Bahamas – possibly the area hit by active volcanoes there OR any fall of meteor [fire] from sky [Libra] in the Pacific region. 
<br /><br />When this korma chakra is applied to India then Gujarat, Maharashtra are the most hit areas by any explosion or natural calamity. 
<br /><br />By any means the end of human civilization is not observed astrologically as the North, North East, south and South East and North directions are observed to be safe. 
<br />About the 2012 prediction – rumors are louder than fact. What is the exact prediction of Mayan Calendar? Did it predict the doomsday clearly? 
<br /><br />Actually, the Mayan Calendar stops there- why? There could be many reasons. Mayans must have many reasons to do it- they must have limited resources or left it for the coming generation to complete it. Or it would have been covered a long time scale then! Or the scatter of group then responsible for writing the calendar or the chief person would have been gone- there would be many many reasons to stop that calendar – but certainly that doesn’t mean the end of the world.

It marks the beginning of the New Year of Vikram Samvat or better known as Vedic [Hindu] Calendar. This Hindu new year is also known as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Telegu. India is a land enriched with different cultures thus there are various calendars in use depending upon regional and cultural backgrounds. Here mostly the New Year celebration is based upon the harvest mostly. However, the famous Vikram Samvat is based on the day when Vikramaditya defeated Sakas and invaded Ujjain. He called for a new era. Under his supervision astronomers formed new calendar based on luni-solar system that was very much near to accuracy, was released that is still followed in the Northern regions of India. 
<br /><br />Astronomically, it is the day when the Sun crosses from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere and intersects the celestial equator and ecliptic. It is known as the first point of Aries, this is the day when Sun enters the first sign of zodiac- Aries. More look at here: <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indastro.com%2Faries.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.indastro.com/aries.html</a></strong> It is also known as Spring Equinox too. This is the day when a chart is drawn to know the yearly upcoming important events related to country and people. Thus, astronomically it is known as to be important day and celebrated with great respect and honor by offering prayers to Gods and Goddesses. The forecast for the coming year is heard by learned person of the society [generally the priest]. 
<br /><br />The beginning of the New Year begins by offering salutations to Devi Durga – who is seated on lion and known as symbol of power and victory. The prayers are held for nine days and nine nights therefore known as Nav- means nine and ratri- means night. Devotees keep fast and perform prayers in the glory of Durga Devi and celebrate navratri with full enthusiasm. The first day of the celebration is the first day of the Hindu New Year too, is celebrated throughout India with great enthusiasm.

After the sacred ghat sthaapan - prayers are offered to Devi Durga that is concluded with aarti and distribution of Prasad. After that the prophecy of the celestial council and its effect on general public along with the rulers is heard. Many people in North India keep fast for nine days to appease Goddess Durga. It is followed by the celebration of Ram Navami- birth day of Lord Rama.

		<document id="99fe183d584bca90a264a92ba45c1bd6" url=""><![CDATA[Major Point of Compatibility Analysis Base on Birth Chart<br/><br/>It is a common saying that no one in this world can live without relationship. Man is a social animal and yearns for someone with whom he can share his life. Life becomes comfortable and colorful with the right partner. It can turn out to be a hell if the partner is not able to understand emotional responses. Relations are just like lock and key- any key is not able to open any lock. Like this any man is not able to knock the girl’s door or vice versa. These are your emotional responses that attract you both. You may have numerous friends but only a few will be able to understand your mind- able to listen to you when you say nothing. 
<br /><br />It is mostly observed that some relations may look harmonious and ultimate in the beginning but becomes sour when the time flies. Looks or attitude - when on the surface may be deceptive. The real nature of the person is observed when you live together- the little things in the life reflects in daily behavior. Other than that there are some phases that makes one behave differently. Circumstances do matter a lot in shaping the relations. A person sometimes himself is unaware that how will he behave in different circumstances. So, how would one take a decision that which person is right for you that will promise a secured and stable relationship? It is seen that love conquers all the scarcities of life – but to which extent and where. It is the fact that no two persons are alike. How differences can be filled up and to which extent? Then it becomes necessary to take a guidance of the one who is wise and look from a far to read the things better. A guide and star reader- who is blessed by special knowledge of stars to understand it. An expert is able to read it quickly whether the both are compatible for each other or not. The major areas of compatibility is to know whether the relationship is harmonious to each other by knowing the temperaments, instant responses etc. whether both are lucky or supportive to each other in different phases of life that includes the major areas like finances, upbringing the family, socially etc.  You will be surprised to know that you bring list of questions and astrology will have answers to all of that. 
<br /><br />This field of compatibility analysis of birth horoscope is so well equipped and accurate that sometimes it looks that it is making you understand with the person who is unknown to you and that is you – ‘yourself’. It is able to tell you the basic nature of you with respect to your partner on the basis of comparing the charts. The comparison of basic planets that made you both to attract each other on the surface- made you both come together on the same plane! The matching of sun signs depicts a lot. This helps you know the basic nature of you and your partner. Whether you both will be truly compatible to each other. Comparison of Venus and Mars will make you understand the passionate side of your partner. Like this an expert is able to let you know the different areas of life with the comparison position of planets.
<br /><br />It is fact, as the two persons are not alike similarly you will not find two horoscopes matching with each other cent percent. At this moment, I would like to pass a thought often delivered by my astrological guru. A couple prayed Lord Shiva for years to be blessed by an obedient and pious son. Lord Shiva was pleased and granted with the boon. That time the life of person was 300 years. As the time passed by the son became well versed in all fields of life during the first 100 years of life. His parents then ask him to get married. He got worried – whether he would be able to find a suitable partner or not. If the partner is not suitable then the whole life will be ruined- he would not be able to grow socially too. So he placed a condition that he would marry a girl who is completely compatible to him astrologically. His parents felt happy and started searching a girl. The search wasted the next 100 years and then the boy grew old to get married. In nutshell, it is to be taken that no two persons are totally compatible astrologically; one has to do some adjustments to make your love life run harmoniously. 
<br /><br />What astrology can do for you then? Here astrology can prove to be the best guide for you to know the emotional responses of your partner as compared to yours. How much adjustment is to be done and that too in which areas. What are the things that can make you both be together and what is there that makes you or your partner happy. If there are differences then how these differences can help you and which manner. What you both are searching in this relationship and how to get it. Inner desires and handle them efficiently. The pitfalls and fill them up. The outer governing forces of the relationship and how to tackle them. The role of key planets in compatibility, comparison of aspects that influences the harmony at social and financial level. Sometimes the luck of partner elevates the luck of other partner and vice versa. There the help of ashta koota matching as well as the Nakshatra calculations guides you well. Aggression and passion is governed by Mars. There manglik dosha cannot be ignored. However, manglik dosha is not fatal always. It creates difference of energy level in both the partners. If matched properly you will be easy to tackle it with [provided, it is not much afflicted or serious in the chart]. Love match can also tells you clearly whether you will be together or the relationship is just for time pass! Are you both destined together? Even if you have been together for years – it will let you know the mistakes and how to amend them. 
<br /><br />Love match will make you aware of the dynamics of astrology at all levels of relationship that will help you to analyze and understand your love relations much better than before. It is famous saying that you take some steps forward and I will take mine like this we both can get along!
