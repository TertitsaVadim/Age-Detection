<br />They where sharing the oranges while a farmer was passing by the gate, and he heard a voice say “ONE FOR U, ONE FOR ME, ONE FOR U, ONE FOR ME”. He was scared and ran to a nearby church, called the reverend saying “COME AND SEE HOW GOD AND SATAN SHARES DEAD PEOPLE IN THE CEMETERY”.
<br />They both left for the cemetery, at the gate unknowing to them, two oranges hung on the cemetery’s gate. Then they both heard the voice saying “ONE FOR U, ONE FOR ME, ONE FOR U, ONE FOR ME, NOW LETS GO AND GET THE OTHER TWO AT THE GATE”.
<br />Immediately the Rev. and the farmer heard, they were scared and ran off leaving their foot wear, because they thought God and Satan are coming for them……

<br />They are discussing problems each is facing in their church.
<br />Pastor Ajax said “MY MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT, I CAN’T STOP STEALING MONEY MEANT FOR THE CHURCH, and I DON’T WANT THE CONGREGATION TO KNOW ABOUT THIS”.
<br />Then pastor Mall said, “MINE IS WORSE B’COS I HAD SLEPT WITH ALMOST ALL THE FEMALES IN THE CHURCH INCLUDING MARRIED WOMEN AND I CAN’T STOP, and I DON’T WANT THE CHURCH TO KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER”.
<br />Then Pastor Bruno said “WOW! THAT IS CRUEL OF YOU BOTH; BUT MY OWN PROBLEM NOW IS THAT I CAN’T JUST STOP IT. MY MOUTH IS THE WORST PROBLEM B’COS WHAT EVER I HEAR OR HAVE HEARD, I CAN’T JUST HELP BUT TELL EVERYONE I MEET”.

<br /><br />It’s been twenty years since I last heard the
<br />heart broken story of my run – away
<br />biological father, somehow my mother had
<br />passed the stag of talking about it. I was
<br />told by her that I was still in the womb
<br />when he ran away from his responsibility.
<br />She said, they were dating and she had
<br />thought she was everything to him. My
<br />father was a widower when they met or so
<br />he said. He said he wanted to marry her. So
<br />they were seeing themselves prior to their
<br />wedding. Each time she talked about visiting
<br />her family, he will tell her that he loved her
<br />too much to go into marriage without
<br />getting prepared for it.
<br />These were the stories and issues between
<br />them for two years until she noticed she
<br />was pregnant. She told him about it, to see if
<br />this will hasten the marriage plans, but
<br />instead it brought the worst out of him. He
<br />screamed and cursed and said everything
<br />he could possibly say to her dismay. He
<br />advised that she goes for an abortion, but
<br />she won ’t hear of it thinking he was only
<br />joking. He told her that he was traveling and
<br />that when he returns she will understand
<br />him if she hasn ’t done as instructed. So my
<br />mother waited until my dad came back and
<br />told her the ugly tale of lies without end.
<br />That he won ’t be tied down by her because
<br />his wife is alive and fine. And that he has
<br />being deceiving her all along.
<br />He left and my mother brought me up
<br />herself. As God will have it, my mother met
<br />an elderly man who had lived all his adult life
<br />in the States and returned without his
<br />children because their mother is a white
<br />woman and she has refused to relocate
<br />with him. So he married my mother,
<br />adopting me and I became a rich man’s
<br />child.
<br />Mum has forgotten her past and is very
<br />happy because of her new found love and
<br />what it came with. On the other hand, I am
<br />not complaining. I travelled to the States for
<br />my doctorate, returned with the driver who
<br />picked me up at the airport. Came down
<br />from the vehicle and sent the driver on an
<br />errand. On getting to the house, I heard
<br />mum crying, while daddy was consoling her.
<br />I eavesdropped to hear the cause of her
<br />stress. I heard the third voice saying he has
<br />a right to meet his own son.
<br />At that point, I couldn’t wait anymore, so I
<br />ran to see the person talking and met the
<br />nightmare and dilemma in the form of a
<br />man kneeling on the floor begging my mum
<br />and on seeing me, started pleading with me
<br />also.

<br />Dad says, &quot;Well son, let me try to explain it this way:
<br />I'm d breadwinner of d family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of d money,
<br />so we'll call her d Government. We're here to take care of ur needs, so we'll call u d people.
<br />The nanny, we'll consider her d Working Class. And ur baby brother, we'll call him d Future.
<br />Now, think about dat &amp; see if dat make sense.&quot;
<br />So d little boy goes off to bed thinking about wat dad had said. Later dat night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds dat d baby has severely soiled his diaper.
<br />So d little boy goes to his parent's room &amp; finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to d nanny's room. Finding d door locked, he peeks in d keyhole &amp; sees his father in bed with d nanny.
<br />He gives up &amp; goes back to bed. the nest morning, d little boy says to his father,
<br />&quot;Dad, I think I Understand d concept of politics now.&quot; 
<br />The Father say, &quot;Good son, tell me in ur own words wat u think politics is all about.&quot;
<br />The little boy replies, &quot;Well, while Capitalism is screwing d Working Class, d Government is sound asleep, d People are being ignored &amp; d Future is in deep shit.&quot;
