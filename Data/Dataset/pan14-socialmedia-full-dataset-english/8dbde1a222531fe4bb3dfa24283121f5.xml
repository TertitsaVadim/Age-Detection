With all of our time spent at work, commuting and on the fly, we have little time to spend out. The economy is also in the dumps, making it difficult to go out cruising for someone to go on a date with. Going out to clubs or bars can be expensive and not end up producing results, so online dating is a perfect way to be productive and get results.<br /><br />There are a few things the online dater should know to get the most responses from potential mates.

You don't want to fill out what others may want to hear, because you won't find someone who likes you for you. It is most important to be honest on your profiles. If you believe in magic, write it down. There will be someone out there who believes in it too.<br /><br />Secondly, post nice looking pictures of yourself. Make sure they are tasteful and don't make you look arrogant. Smiles say a lot, so smile above all in your photo. No half naked pictures or cleavage shots produce serious results. If you are looking for a sex partner, there are sites specifically for that. Try adultfriendfinder.com. Pictures are worth thousands of words, so it's important that you post flattering shots. The shots should be recent, not ten years old. And the shots should be close up enough for a person to see your face clearly. Try posting a close up and a shot of your body. This was the person looking at you can see what your entire package looks like.<br /><br />Beware of people who are too fast to fall in love and people who ask for money. These are usually scammers. There are many scammers online, so if you think it's too good to be true, it probably is.<br /><br />Also, before you go on a date, ask the person for a recent photo from their cell phone. This way you know exactly who you are looking for on your date and you can verify that the pictures on their site were really them.

It helps an individual make the decision whether they want to live with the other person for the rest of their life or not. Dating before marriage is usually referred to as courtship, because the relationship has passed the stage of just getting to know each other, but tailoring it towards marriage. The debate surrounding dating and marriage has been in existence for a while now, with some people advocating for it, and others against it all together. Nevertheless, going on dates that leads to marriage or not is still common. This indicates that it is still relevant for a majority of people. When planning to get married, there are a variety of reasons why dating before marriage is necessary and they include:<br /><br />First, dating before marriage helps you understand your partner better so that you can be able to get along with minimal conflict. The merging of two people from diverse backgrounds is likely to bring with it a lot of ups and downs, so it is better to go through the struggles before marriage, to know if you can cope with them before marriage.<br /><br />Second, when dating with the main goal being to get married, it helps the couple focus on what they should expect in marriage. This focus will help you evaluate whether you are ready for marriage or not, and the responsibilities that come with it. There are some couples that have realized while dating before marriage, that they are not compatible with each other and have ended the relationship before getting married.<br /><br />Third, understanding each other's likes as well as dislikes are most likely to be discovered when dating before marriage. The more you understand your partner, the more likely you will be able to get along even better within the marriage. It is during this courtship period that you get to know what you can handle, and characteristics that you will not be able to live with.<br /><br />Fourth, future plans and ambitions of a couple are discovered when dating before marriage as they discuss different aspects of their lives. Most of the time, the plans and even ambitions of each partner may differ because they are living individual lives. However, as the courtship progresses it is important to be aware of the possibility of harmonizing future plans, so that you have the same focus.<br /><br />Fifth, dating before marriage strengthens a relationship because of the various life situations that the couple has to go through together as they prepare for marriage. It is in these life situations that you see your partner for who they are, and their ability to handle different situations that may also arise in marriage. However, for some couples, these situations open up their eyes to the realities of the life they are likely to live in marriage and they choose to opt out.<br /><br />Results of not dating before marriage<br /><br />Even with the importance of dating before marriage being emphasized in different types of publications, and married people, there are still couples that decide to forgo dating and just get married. The most obvious result of not getting to know each other before marriage is divorce. Many people who are divorced now, are likely to not have dated before making a decision to get married, and found that they are unable to handle the responsibilities of marriage or to live with the person they married.<br /><br />Another result of not dating before walking down the aisle is that you are not aware of the goal of the marriage. Lack of focus on where the marriage is heading is likely to bring about conflict because everyone has their own life that they want to live within the marriage. A marriage that does not have a common goal is likely to disintegrate at the first sign of trouble.<br /><br />In addition, friendship in dating is developed over time, and this cannot be done without courtship between two people. Friendship is important in a marriage because there are times when the feelings of love will not be there, but because you are friends, there are other points of connection.<br /><br />Overall, dating before marriage is important and should not be neglected if a marriage is to have a chance of survival.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Find Love</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Click Here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Click For Dating</a>

Burton has Depp. Indeed, the teaming of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp has confirmed iconic, lasting more than two decades and yielding seven films. Burton's unique directorial imaginative and prescient averted Depp from fading into obscurity after his brush with '80s TV heartthrob fame. And in Depp, Burton has found a peculiar regulate ego and muse to match his dark visions. Even of their separate tasks, their shared frame of work remains very much found in our subconscious.<br /><br />Edward Scissorhands (1990) It all started in 1990, while Depp tried to parlay his &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; success into a profession in films. Most likely eager to desert his Tiger Beat matinee-idol symbol, he made two unconventional choices: John Waters' &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; and Burton's &quot;Edward Scissorhands.&quot; Nearly unrecognizable within the latter with the disfigured light visage, jet-black mad-scientist coif and fetishistic leather-based apparel, he instantly made us omit approximately Tom Hanson from &quot;21 Jump Street.&quot;<br /><br />Ed Wood (1994) Burton and Depp's next collaboration, &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; was a business crisis, but it surely was once nevertheless a defining moment in their respective careers. This loving tribute to the &quot;Worst Director of All Time&quot; proved the pair could excel outdoor the area of myth and create something wacky and really moving.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow (1999) A key to the duo's a success partnership is the fact that it has evolved over time. Within the past due '90s, Burton attempted to rebound from the disastrous &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; with prestige tasks that had literary or cinematic pedigree. Depp was steadily organising himself as a bankable top man. With &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; the pair tackled Washington Irving's American Gothic classic. It was additionally the only time that Burton allowed Depp to appear to be a proper film star.<br /><br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) Next, they attempted an edition of Roald Dahl's &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.&quot; Even though Burton had made circle of relatives-friendly fare equivalent to &quot;Pee-wee's Large Adventure&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; earlier in his career, he had no longer attempted his hand at a beloved children's vintage akin to this. For the first time, the filmmaker integrated vibrant, pastel, sweet-colored set designs, while Depp added an unusually stressed out efficiency as Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Corpse Bride (2005) The pair re-teamed for the forestall-movement musical, &quot;Corpse Bride,&quot; which saw them revisiting familiar Goth territory. Even if Burton had produced a lot of Henry Selick's prevent-motion animations comparable to &quot;The Nightmare Prior to Christmas&quot; (1993) and &quot;James and the Large Peach&quot; (1996), the film marked his first oeuvre within the genre as a director. It used to be only herbal for Depp to lend his voice to its protagonist.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) Burton and Depp it sounds as if couldn't get enough of musical macabre and adopted up &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; with the variation of Stephen Sondheim's 1979 level production. Burton have been a fan of the show, and reportedly had approached Sondheim within the past due '80s a couple of screen adaptation. For his section, Depp took singing courses to sing their own praises his vocal chops.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Johnny Depp Site</a>

		<document id="f42fb65c6af432f6a5f6551fdbd41c42" url=""><![CDATA[Try Online Dating In Your City<br/><br/>1. Post a recent photo of yourself that's flattering and actually looks like you. Chances are you have one really fantastic photo of yourself that was taken at just the right angle that you look ever so slightly like Blake Lively or Jake Gyllenhaal. Don't post that picture. Post the picture that actually looks like &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; - you on a good day (in great lighting). You want people to know what to expect and not be disappointed when it's you who shows up for your date.<br /><br />2. Be unique and specific in your profile. Everyone likes to have fun, okay? Everyone likes hanging out with friends, listening to music, and &quot;going out.&quot; So tell people something they don't already know about you, like that the beer you brewed in your backyard last summer won first prize in a home brewing contest, or that you do a brilliant version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; at karaoke.<br /><br />3. Avoid negative language in your profile. It should go without saying that mentioning an ex or how bad a past relationship was is a definite no-no when writing an online profile, but in the same vein, negative language (anything that starts with: &quot;I hate,&quot; &quot;I don't like,&quot; &quot;I don't know&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> all sound lame and cast a shadow over you, too.<br /><br />4. Only respond to people who interest you. If you post a flattering photo and write a unique and upbeat profile, chances are you'll get lots of responses from potential suitors. Do NOT respond to all of them. Only pick the ones who truly appeal to you to reply to. For all the others, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; message is the message... and it's a lot kinder (and faster) than saying, &quot;Hmm, no thanks.&quot;<br /><br />5. Avoid Googling a potential match. Let's say you happen to get a whole name - or enough info about a potential match that you're able to track him or her on Google. Don't do it! It's more fun to learn stuff about people the old-fashioned way (through conversation), and you don't risk making presumptions or inadvertently revealing that you know something you shouldn't.<br /><br />6. Keep your emails brief. A general rule of thumb: two paragraphs is ideal; respond to something that was shared with you; share something new about yourself; ask at least one question the other person can answer; and leave plenty to talk about for your first date.<br /><br />7. If there's interest, meet in person quickly. Respond to messages within a day or two (three tops!), and make plans to meet up in person after you've exchanged a handful of messages. If it's been three weeks - or three months! - and you're still emailing someone you haven't made plans to meet, then what you've got is a pen-pal and there's probably a reason things haven't progressed past that.<br /><br />8. Protect your privacy. Keep your address, place of employment, and other personal information to yourself until you've gone out on at least a couple dates. I mean, duh.<br /><br />9. Meet in public and tell at least one person where you'll be and what time you expect to be home.<br /><br />10. Plan a first date that can be short, sweet, and low-key, like lunch or a coffee date. The last thing you need is to get stuck on some long, drawn-out date with someone who bores you to tears, so use the first date to see if there's a spark (which you can figure out in about five minutes), and it there is one, you can plan something longer or more intimate for the next time.<br /><br />11. Keep your options open! Just because you've had a few great email exchanges - or even a couple awesome dates - with someone doesn't mean you should log off the site just yet. People - especially ones who are practically strangers to you - have a way of being flakey and can disappear, change their minds, or simply let you down. That's not to say that won't happen at any point in your relationship, but there's a great likelihood of these things happening early on, so keep your options open until you're ready to be exclusive.<br /><br />12. Don't date someone just for &quot;practice.&quot; Let's say you've gotten a few responses to your profile, but no one is really knocking your socks off. It's been a bit of a dry spell for you and you're feeling a little rusty when it comes to dating, so you figure what's the harm in going out with one of these people just to oil the ol' engine. The harm is you're leading someone on, wasting valuable time (theirs and yours) and creating bad karma in the process. If you know you aren't interested, MOA.<br /><br />13. Don't take the rejection personally. Not only can you not be everyone's type, there are plenty of reasons people pass on potential matches that have little to do with the other person. Maybe you look too much like the ex who broke his heart. His loss.<br /><br />14. Take a break if you're feeling jaded. This goes back to #3. You don't have to necessarily use negative language in your profile to wreak of negativity. A bad attitude - and desperation - is just as bad. So, if you find yourself getting discouraged about the way things are going, close your account for a month or two, regroup and come back after you've cleared your head (and aura).<br /><br />15. Try different sites. Another thing you can do if you're feeling discouraged, is simply try a different site. Dating sites are like restaurants - some of them have better menus than others. So if nothing at your current spot sounds appetizing, move along. There are plenty of places out there to dine...<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>

After a few weeks of playing a young-looking cop who goes undercover at high schools to catch drug dealers, the Kentucky-born actor began to feel that the spying he performed in each episode was immoral. Worse yet, Jump Street was a breakout hit, and Depp's busy schedule kept him from accepting movie offers. The resentful teen idol tried to provoke his bosses into terminating him. His onset antics included lighting his underwear on fire, constantly changing dialogue and suggesting wild plot lines, such as having his character cover his entire nude body with peanut butter. The program's creators realized that their leading man was the main reason viewers tuned in and held him to his contract. Johnny did a professional job and appreciated Jump Street for making him a household name, but compared his being able to leave the show in 1990 to the freeing of imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela.<br /><br />After years of playing dingbat society types, Natalie Schafer (1900- 1991) was perfectly cast as the spoiled but kind-hearted Lovey Howell on the Gilligan's Island pilot in 1963. For the veteran actress, it was all about getting a quick paycheck, plus a free vacation to Hawaii. The script about seven castaways, without a single luxury, was so stupid; there was no way that the network would pick it up. With this kind of material floating around Hollywood, she couldn't wait to move back to New York. The Red Bank, New Jersey, native did a professional job, and then quickly forgot about being marooned. A few weeks later, Schafer was vacationing in Puerto Vallarta with some friends when she received a phone call. &quot;What! Oh my God, no!&quot; Her companions, assuming that it was bad news about her ailing mother, ran to comfort her. To their surprise, Natalie's tears were caused by CBS' decision to make Gilligan a weekly series, which the actress was now contractually obligated to be on. At that moment, Schafer was crushed to have the new, wellpaying employment that would make her famous.<br /><br />James Garner became a popular TV star because of the Warner Bros. western Maverick (1957-1962). But to the Oklahoma born actor and Korean War veteran, the show was often purgatory. The studio refused him permission to earn extra money on weekends making personal appearances, and turned down his requests for a raise. He finally got out of the show through a breech of contract suit, and stated bitterly &quot;If you have any pride in your work you don't go into TV.&quot; When he returned to TV after 11 years of films to The Rockford Files (1974-1980) he again quickly became unhappy with working conditions and staged a successful sit down strike in his dressing room to get what he wanted.<br /><br />Sometimes a seeming big break can turn into a nightmare. Stage actress Vivian Vance was thrilled to get the role of Ethel on I Love Lucy (1951-1957). Vance, who was a good-looking woman, even acceded to Lucille Ball's demand that she be twenty pounds overweight. Each summer she would get an irritating phone call from Ball,&quot; Viv, we start shooting in a couple of weeks, start eating.&quot; But playing a frumpy, second banana weighed on her. One day sitting in her make-up chair she complained for all to hear,&quot; Can you believe they have me married to that old coot, William Frawley? He should be playing my father. Every morning when I get my script I say please God, don't let me have any kissing scenes with the old coot.&quot; During her diatribe the old coot was standing right behind her, which started a long and famous feud. Later when Desi Arnaz proposed creating a spin-off show called The Mertzes, which could of made them both rich, Frawley jumped at it, but Vance killed the idea stating, &quot;Six years is long enough to be married to the old coot.&quot;<br /><br />Not everyone is unhappy in television. Comic actor Don Adams faced a difficult financial choice when he played the bumbling Maxwell Smart in the 1965 television series Get Smart. The producers offered him two options: he could take home a healthy paycheck each week or get very little money in exchange for a one-third ownership stake in the show. The ex-Marine swallowed hard and gambled for the long term. Get Smart stayed on the air for five years and was shown constantly in reruns. Viewers repeated Adams' made-up catch phrases like &quot;Would you believe&quot; and &quot;Missed me by that much&quot; often. The now wealthy star, who claimed he hated performing, was able to spend the last years of his life playing cards at the Playboy Mansion and traveling the world with his seven children. When asked how he ended up with such a large brood, the three-times-married Don shrugged, &quot;No big deal. It only took seven minutes.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Dark Shadows</a>

Since then, he's been in the industry for twenty-five years and has been nominated twice for an Oscar as well as five Golden Globes. Depp relied heavily on the influence of other actors that he worked with in the years of his success, and the skills and style of acting he obtained through analysing human mannerism and downright becoming a completely different being by taking on the responsibility to become something else.<br /><br />His key motivations derived from the actors he worked with and how he was able to learn from them in the process of filming a movie. Depp states in a 2002 interview with James Lipton that &quot;the opportunity to go and work with Marin Landau was a great, great gift,&quot; as he restored his faith and work as an actor. Depp draws from these great actors talents and skills that help him throughout his career as an actor, and sometimes even impersonating them in scenes - such as his imitation of his close friend Marlon Brandon in the Secret Window (2004).<br /><br />Johnny Depp style of acting can be recognised through his costuming of long hair and quirky hats, however, his most noticeable trait yet is his choice of roles as &quot;freakishly eccentric outcasts whose oddities are misunderstood by society, and usually have a flamboyant appearance and mannerism.&quot; [Shankar 2009] James Lipton [2002] gave the statistics that 99.9% of actors yearn to take the path of traditional leading man roles, yet Depp deliberately avoided that option. Depp replied that it's the &quot;element of surprise&quot; that drove him and the discomfort he felt when he was so popular in the media. [Depp 2002]<br /><br />Depp becomes inspired and draws out his characters through instinct and imagery that he has in his mind from past experiences and imagination, forming in his head what he thinks could be similar to character's personality. Since he has taken on many factual based characters (seven in total from 1994 to 2005), he feels a great responsibility to that person he is acting to literally become them in mannerism and behaviour so as not to disrespect their value as a human being. &quot;For me, all I wanted was for [Joe Pistone; the real Donnie Brasco (1997)] to be happy, because he lived it and I played it, but then he has to live with it, and his family has to live with it for the rest of their lives. So I was very touched that they were satisfied.&quot;<br /><br />Depp's acting moments were portrayed as a charmer in Cry-Baby (1990) and a &quot;pathetic, sweet and lovable freak&quot; [Wood 2001] in Edward Scissorhands (1990). Though, for the most part, Depp was hardly ever considered as a &quot;box-office friendly name&quot; [IMDB.com 2009] for those slight errors he made and was arrested for in 1994 and 1999. Therefore, when director Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was released in 2003, his career sky-rocketed once again to its peak as the movie made US$330,000,000 [Letterman 2006] with him as the leading actor Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />Depp defines a character through their human behaviour and the level of truth and honesty they are created from (realistically speaking). &quot;I'm interested in what makes people do what they do, and what makes people tick, and why they have these nervous gestures.&quot; [Depp 2002] When he reads a screenplay, he'll decide how to define his character on the initial feeling and instincts he gets from reading about the character's behaviour, attitude, lifestyle, etc. He sought out Hunter Thompson, author of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1972) to become acquainted with his character when acting in the movie in 1998, and to &quot;figure out a way to steal his soul&quot; [Depp 2002] and be able to become him in every aspect.<br /><br />&quot;He's very intuitive. It's kind of contradictory because he's incredibly intelligent and smart, but he will react from his heart and not from his head. For me, really good actors don't act, they react; they become a character and they're put in a situation that their character's in and react to it.&quot; <br />&lt;br&gt;[Jarmusch 2000]<br /><br />Overall, Johnny Depp had debuted in 1984 with Nightmare of Elm's Street on the mission to work in the music industry, and instead grew to fame through acting peculiar character roles such as Edward in Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). His fascination with the concept of outcasts and the &quot;normality&quot; in society drives him to design characters beyond recognisable, creating a whole new level of acting and living.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Movies by Johnny Depp</a>

Chances are you have one really fantastic photo of yourself that was taken at just the right angle that you look ever so slightly like Blake Lively or Jake Gyllenhaal. Don't post that picture. Post the picture that actually looks like &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; - you on a good day (in great lighting). You want people to know what to expect and not be disappointed when it's you who shows up for your date.<br /><br />2. Be unique and specific in your profile. Everyone likes to have fun, okay? Everyone likes hanging out with friends, listening to music, and &quot;going out.&quot; So tell people something they don't already know about you, like that the beer you brewed in your backyard last summer won first prize in a home brewing contest, or that you do a brilliant version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; at karaoke.<br /><br />3. Avoid negative language in your profile. It should go without saying that mentioning an ex or how bad a past relationship was is a definite no-no when writing an online profile, but in the same vein, negative language (anything that starts with: &quot;I hate,&quot; &quot;I don't like,&quot; &quot;I don't know&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> all sound lame and cast a shadow over you, too.<br /><br />4. Only respond to people who interest you. If you post a flattering photo and write a unique and upbeat profile, chances are you'll get lots of responses from potential suitors. Do NOT respond to all of them. Only pick the ones who truly appeal to you to reply to. For all the others, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; message is the message... and it's a lot kinder (and faster) than saying, &quot;Hmm, no thanks.&quot;<br /><br />5. Avoid Googling a potential match. Let's say you happen to get a whole name - or enough info about a potential match that you're able to track him or her on Google. Don't do it! It's more fun to learn stuff about people the old-fashioned way (through conversation), and you don't risk making presumptions or inadvertently revealing that you know something you shouldn't.<br /><br />6. Keep your emails brief. A general rule of thumb: two paragraphs is ideal; respond to something that was shared with you; share something new about yourself; ask at least one question the other person can answer; and leave plenty to talk about for your first date.<br /><br />7. If there's interest, meet in person quickly. Respond to messages within a day or two (three tops!), and make plans to meet up in person after you've exchanged a handful of messages. If it's been three weeks - or three months! - and you're still emailing someone you haven't made plans to meet, then what you've got is a pen-pal and there's probably a reason things haven't progressed past that.<br /><br />8. Protect your privacy. Keep your address, place of employment, and other personal information to yourself until you've gone out on at least a couple dates. I mean, duh.<br /><br />9. Meet in public and tell at least one person where you'll be and what time you expect to be home.<br /><br />10. Plan a first date that can be short, sweet, and low-key, like lunch or a coffee date. The last thing you need is to get stuck on some long, drawn-out date with someone who bores you to tears, so use the first date to see if there's a spark (which you can figure out in about five minutes), and it there is one, you can plan something longer or more intimate for the next time.<br /><br />11. Keep your options open! Just because you've had a few great email exchanges - or even a couple awesome dates - with someone doesn't mean you should log off the site just yet. People - especially ones who are practically strangers to you - have a way of being flakey and can disappear, change their minds, or simply let you down. That's not to say that won't happen at any point in your relationship, but there's a great likelihood of these things happening early on, so keep your options open until you're ready to be exclusive.<br /><br />12. Don't date someone just for &quot;practice.&quot; Let's say you've gotten a few responses to your profile, but no one is really knocking your socks off. It's been a bit of a dry spell for you and you're feeling a little rusty when it comes to dating, so you figure what's the harm in going out with one of these people just to oil the ol' engine. The harm is you're leading someone on, wasting valuable time (theirs and yours) and creating bad karma in the process. If you know you aren't interested, MOA.<br /><br />13. Don't take the rejection personally. Not only can you not be everyone's type, there are plenty of reasons people pass on potential matches that have little to do with the other person. Maybe you look too much like the ex who broke his heart. His loss.<br /><br />14. Take a break if you're feeling jaded. This goes back to #3. You don't have to necessarily use negative language in your profile to wreak of negativity. A bad attitude - and desperation - is just as bad. So, if you find yourself getting discouraged about the way things are going, close your account for a month or two, regroup and come back after you've cleared your head (and aura).<br /><br />15. Try different sites. Another thing you can do if you're feeling discouraged, is simply try a different site. Dating sites are like restaurants - some of them have better menus than others. So if nothing at your current spot sounds appetizing, move along. There are plenty of places out there to dine...<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Dating Search</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Dating 2k</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

In fact, even when we are trying to meet women that society at large would deem to be somewhat on the average side, it is still quite the challenge.<br /><br />If we were to look at online dating from a simple perspective one my look upon this invention as a miraculous gift from the God's, full of opportunity that is bestowing mankind the wonderful opportunity to hunt and gather all women at his own convenience. Whether he wishes to hunt and gather before his morning breakfast, after an afternoon snack, or late at night while just winding down, the women are all there and just waiting to be messaged online.<br /><br />But what happens when the man in question goes after the women he seeks and finds that these females are unresponsive to a degree in which he is unable to receive the dates he is looking for no matter how hard he works or tries at the situation. The man sends email after email thinking that this unique and creative email will be the one that will have the girl dying to message him and thinking that he will be the greatest date on the internet.<br /><br />Yet, these dreams that these men hope for will often go unfilled as they are left to contemplate what they are doing that has resulted in almost no productivity whatsoever. The truth is that dealing with such a troublesome blow can be one of the toughest aspects of online dating.<br /><br />What should we do when this situation occurs?

He said that love is like a ghost because many people talk about it, however, only few have really seen it. This statement is absolutely and undeniably true. <br /><br />A man and a woman have been created to love one another and to share a life together as one. Sadly, lots of men and women out there are loveless. Some of them are still waiting for his or her perfect match to come but some have grown tired of waiting. So which are you – the happily in love, the one yet waiting for the right one or the one who has already given up on love? <br /><br />Men and women, as much as possible, do not want to spend their lives and grow old alone. What can one loveless single do if there is none out there interested with him/her? Or what would a single and waiting do if he/she has no prospect for the reason that he/she has zero social life? Before, when there was yet no internet, this could be a dead serious problem but now it no longer is that much of a problem. Credits ought to be given to dating sites and to dating site reviews as well. <br /><br />Dating Sites, which help lots of singles out there to browse through its members and look for a great prospect, are evaluated by dating site reviews relating to their asset or advantage. Dating sites provide singles with a wide selection of prospects. They require singles to post their personal information, as well as a picture. With this, many could see a single's profile and be interested to know more about him/her, and eventually meet and go out on a date. That's hassle-free. <br /><br />There are a lot of dating sites with different features. When choosing which dating site to subscribe to, one should take into consideration reading dating site reviews, for this can help an individual to have an effective and a greater search for love. Of course, not all dating sites are the same. Yes, they have the same function however some are definitely better than the others. That's the aim of dating site reviews. What singles are to get from dating site reviews are data pertaining to a particular dating site's overall rating - registration, number of members, monthly cost, guarantee, ease of use, quality of profiles and value for money. <br /><br />A single, who's serious about meeting the love of his/her life by means of the use of modern technology, specifically the online dating sites, should first search for an effective dating site by seeking the help of dating site reviews, which also plays a significant role in the quest for a lifetime partner.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Oasis Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9NYW5jaGVzdGVy" target="_blank">Online Dating</a>

		<document id="4371c3076a577ac0842a52bea5c77a00" url=""><![CDATA[Johnny Depp Films<br/><br/>If you haven't noticed, there's sort of a big vampire craze going on right now in the entertainment industry, so you can't really blame Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for their attempt at joining in the fun. If you are hung up on your undead being of the sparkly and smoldering variety, however, you'll have to stick with Young Adult fiction-----these characters are darker and a little less likely to end up on a poster on your tween daughter's bedroom door.<br /><br />THE GOOD: The story begins in the 1700's, with the Collins family leaving Liverpool, England for America, and settling in what will soon become Collinsport, Maine. Joshua Collins (Ivan Kaye) establishes a thriving seaport town, and soon uses his family fortune to build a mansion for his wife and young son, Barnabas. When a household servant (Eva Green) falls in love with the grown Barnabas (played by Depp), and is rejected by him, we learn she is a vindictive witch----literally----and unleashes a curse on the Collins family, turning the young Collins heir into a vampire who is then buried alive. Fast forward 200 years to 1972, when Barnabas rises from his grave intent on restoring his family's name and estate to their former glory.<br /><br />The younger generation will be mostly oblivious to the fact that this film is a remake of the 40 year old daytime drama of the same name, although Burton's adaptation is undoubtedly stranger and more risque than anything that ever appeared on daytime television in the 60's. To his credit, Tim Burton always manages to bring the &quot;creepy&quot; factor to his films and this is no exception. Most of it is very tongue in cheek, so there's very little chance of anyone being traumatized or having nightmares afterwards, but as previously mentioned, Depp's vampire character is unmistakably NOT a high school heartthrob, so you won't be having teenage girls and middle aged women losing their minds over his dreaminess.......Well, alright---it IS Johnny Depp.....the guy makes just about any character look good, and I will be the first to admit that he even makes a pale corpse with long dirty fingernails look shockingly desirable. His deadpan responses and comedic timing is charming as well. And, as we have all come to expect in Tim Burton movies, there are plenty of other dysfunctional characters to help us feel uncomfortable and entertained.<br /><br />THE BAD: If you have had your fill of Depp/Burton movies, then you will probably want to skip this one, simply because it feels pretty much like all the other Depp/Burton movies before it. There is certainly a large movie going fanbase that have NOT tired of this duo, and I suppose for argument's sake, I reside in that camp. I realize right off that I probably won't be seeing a film that will be renknowned for much of anything except some general weirdness, a few dark laughs, and Depp in his many wonderous incarnations of male splendor. But sometimes that's perfectly sufficient for me. And I suppose that in the end, that is what the actual downside of this move amounts to: It isn't particularly notable, it's just sufficient entertainment for an evening.<br /><br />THE UGLY: I'll get directly to the point---for all the screen time filled with vampires, witches, and other hideous cast members, the grand prize goes to the cameo appearance of Alice Cooper. As a friend of mine so eloquently put it:: &quot;Seeing Alice Cooper perform live in 1972 would probably have been cool.......it was a lot less cool seeing Alice Cooper as a 64 year old man performing in a movie set in 1972.&quot; I'm not even sure I would agree with the first part of that statement, but the last part was dead on.<br /><br />For all the hype about this movie, the best I can do is tell you that, because I never actually watched the original show, I have no idea if fans of the former daytime drama will be pleased or disappointed with this version. My older sister, who grew up with the show and went to the movie with me, said they got a lot of things right, so that's certainly saying something. And let's face it, there are worse things to do with your evening than staring at Johnny Depp.<br /><br />The Trophy Wife gives this movie 2 ?? trophies.<br /><br />Dark Shadows has a running time of 113 minutes and is rated PG-13 for comic horror, violence, sexual content, some drug use, language and smoking.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Johnny Depp Films</a>

Burton has Depp. Indeed, the teaming of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp has confirmed iconic, lasting more than two decades and yielding seven films. Burton's unique directorial imaginative and prescient averted Depp from fading into obscurity after his brush with '80s TV heartthrob fame. And in Depp, Burton has found a peculiar regulate ego and muse to match his dark visions. Even of their separate tasks, their shared frame of work remains very much found in our subconscious.<br /><br />Edward Scissorhands (1990) It all started in 1990, while Depp tried to parlay his &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; success into a profession in films. Most likely eager to desert his Tiger Beat matinee-idol symbol, he made two unconventional choices: John Waters' &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; and Burton's &quot;Edward Scissorhands.&quot; Nearly unrecognizable within the latter with the disfigured light visage, jet-black mad-scientist coif and fetishistic leather-based apparel, he instantly made us omit approximately Tom Hanson from &quot;21 Jump Street.&quot;<br /><br />Ed Wood (1994) Burton and Depp's next collaboration, &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; was a business crisis, but it surely was once nevertheless a defining moment in their respective careers.

Of course, fat people can only be accepted by the public in comedic roles, and this film wouldn't try to break that stereotype. This film is called Heavyweights.<br /><br />Heavyweights is, quite simply, a movie about fat kids. Fat kids who were always the brunt of jokes, eaters of junk food, and constant outgrowers of clothing. It's a family film about parents who think that sending their children to a rigorous fat camp is the only way for them to lead normal lives.<br /><br />It's the all-important last day of school and Gerry is a fat loaf of a child. He's so fat that he misses his bus on the last way to school and has to run after it, waving his flabby arms in futility. Poor fat Gerry. His life gets worse when he arrives home and his parents spring the news that they're shipping his grotesque body off to the fat-burning farm known as Camp Hope.<br /><br />Reluctant at first, Gerry realizes that this camp can actually be fun. There are go karts and those giant inflatable things that you jump on to launch people into the air. Suddenly, Gerry's &quot;not the fat kid. Everyone's the fat kid.&quot; It's also important to note that the other fat, undisciplined food addicts at the camp have smuggled in enough junk food hooch to last until the new millennium. This was going to be an awesomely bodacious summer, right? Wrong.<br /><br />There are strange and horrible things afoot at the unassuming Camp Hope. On his first night at the camp, Gerry is shocked to learn that the original, fun owners of Camp Hope are bankrupt and have been forced to sell the camp to a douchebag of an infomercial fitness trainer named Tony Perkis who will stop at nothing to whip the kids into shape at the expense of their personal safety. He tries to relate to the kids by explaining how he was once a fattie, but his psychotic methods of weight loss and exercise quickly turn him into enemy number one.<br /><br />Tony, on an insane power trip, goes so far as to raid the campers' bunks and remove any and all junk food from the premises. He wakes them up at the crack of dawn and forces them into painful runs and merciless workout routines and generally makes their lives living hells.<br /><br />The campers end up stumbling on the camp's hidden food stash in the woods and begin to gain weight despite Tony's insanity. After Tony learns of the weight gain, he forces them on a 20-mile hike as punishment. However, the campers trick Tony into falling into a pit trap which injures him and leaves him helpless. The boys manage to get Tony back to camp and build a prison cell for him out of chicken wire that has been electrified by a bug zapper.<br /><br />As a result of the downfall of Tony's reign of terror, the campers break out into an abhorrent display of binge eating to commemorate the occasion. Stuffing their faces with pizzas and ice cream sundaes, the kids go a little bit crazy. The next morning, the fat and lovable counselor Pat takes responsibility for the fat youngsters and decides to start helping them legitimately lose weight.<br /><br />Later, the parents of the campers visit the camp and are shown a video of Tony's cruelty to alert them to the situation. During the viewing, Tony escapes from his cell and interrupts them. Tony's own father shows up to take the deed to the camp away from his son and to ensure that this will never happen again. Planning to close the camp and issue refunds, he instead listens the camper's protests to keep the camp open. They nominate Pat as head counselor and he coaches them to just have fun and ends up leading them to a victory against an overly competitive rival summer camp.<br /><br />There is enough slapstick and fat humor in this movie to keep any kid happy and it's a family-friendly romp that even the parents will enjoy. 90s movies knew how to do it right. Check it out.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">Walking Dead</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Movie Reviews</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Hunger Games</a>

I'd wager the attraction is to the character because of the depth Depp brings to the part in his portrayal. Others might say Depp is the larger attraction. They may be right.<br /><br />What follows is a review of the pirate costume that the character Jack Sparrow wears -as brought to life by Johnny Depp. Included are some of the finer points of detail one might want to be aware of when shopping for such a costume.<br /><br />To begin with this outfit, you will want to look at the pirate hat. It needs to rest comfortably and have beneath it the bandana that is trademark for this character with the long braids of hair spilling down from it. If it has been pre-formed you'll be able to put it on without having to make too many overall adjustments to it. That will save you time when you are getting ready to head out the door.<br /><br />For the top of the Jack Sparrow pirate costume, there should be a tattered shirt beneath a brown jacket. This helps to aid in the period reflection from which this costume originates. It is then combined with the blue vest and chest belt with buckle that will have you looking like you just walked off the set. You can then combine that with the boot covers and some black trousers. You will quickly find that this costume is one that could make a lasting impression.<br /><br />It is funny to speculate why Mr. Sparrow the pirate wore so many articles of clothing. The Caribbean Sea is an area that usually enjoys an average temperature of about 80 degrees F. But, I digress. If you hail from the northern half of the United States, you will be happy to have a couple of layers of clothing in late October.<br /><br />As Celebrity Halloween Costumes go, this character will have people cheering and offering you a bottle of rum as you walk around in your Jack Sparrow pirate costume. What you will want to keep in mind, if you are considering shopping for this costume, is that while it can appear to be very complete, there are some accessories that can help to take it to the next level.<br /><br />One of those choices is the 'captain boots' that you can use for this costume. This will give the authentic pirate look and have you clomping comfortably around in your costume. Another important item to consider for your Jack Sparrow Costume will be the goatee and mustache designed to mirror those of the character in the film. That is, of course, unless you want to grow your own beard. You won't have time to grow a handlebar mustache, however so, you might want to buy the prop. For the finishing touches on the outfit, a black makeup stick will be the final item that you will want to have on hand. The black make-up stick will make you appear swarthy, sweaty and unwashed -perfect for a scoundrel like pirate Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />The costume comes in a variety of sizes. This means that you can find this costume in smaller sizes designed for kids, teens (and tweens). Additionally, the outfit is available with some variances that are designed for plus size adults as well.<br /><br />Since the goal is to have a Celebrity Halloween outfit that people will notice and love, you could put this Jack Sparrow dress-up at the top of your list. It may meet all the needs you have and be really one of the most complete choices you will find. Best of all, it will work perfectly for a costume party with children or even one that is filled with adults. That makes it a universally sound choice that will stick out and leave an impression with those who see you decked out in it.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Johnny Depp Films</a>
