<br /><br />What's your work pet peeve? Perhaps you're irked by people showing up late to meetings or you can't stand your colleagues' liberal use of &quot;Reply All.&quot; Though these things bother you, it may be impossible to get rid of them. Instead, learn to manage your pet peeve:
<br /><br />Anticipate.
<br />Sometimes you'll be able to foresee events that will trigger your pet peeve. Think through how you will handle these situations so that you are not caught off guard. 
<br /><br />Laugh.
<br />If you can get some distance from your pet peeve, you're more likely to see the humor in it. When you get annoyed, try to observe how silly your anger may seem. 
<br /><br />Reward. 
<br />On those occasions when you manage to not get annoyed by your pet peeve, reward yourself for good behavior.

<br /><strong>[b]2010, International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures
<br /><br />The year 2010 will be celebrated as the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures . The goal of the International Year consists in making the rapprochement of cultures the hallmark of all policy-making at local, national, regional and international levels, involving the greatest number of relevant stakeholders.
<br /><br />Entrusted with the mandate to contribute to build &quot;the defences of peace in the minds of men&quot; thanks to international cooperation in the fields of its competence, namely through education, sciences, culture and communication, UNESCO is designated to play a leading role for the celebration of the Year within the United Nations system. In fact, over the years and indeed in the past decade, the Organization has gained special experience and has won recognition through its efforts to demonstrate the beneficial effects of cultural diversity highlighting the importance of borrowings, transfers and exchanges between cultures.

<br /><br />Too often managers make mistakes because they are afraid to ask for help. Not knowing how to do something may be embarrassing, but not asking for help can lead to disastrous results. Next time you are faced with something you are uncertain about, use these three steps to ask your colleague, manager, or peer for assistance:
<br /><br /><strong>1-[b]Start with what you know</strong>. [/b]Begin your request for help with context and background about the situation so that the other person knows what you know. 
<br /><br /><strong>2-[b]Ask for feedback on a proposed direction</strong>. [/b]Just because you are uncertain doesn't mean you can't form an opinion. Explain what you are thinking of doing and ask for input and direction. 
<br /><br /><strong>3-[b]Ask for tangible advice</strong>.[/b] If you are still unsure about what direction to take, be direct with the other person. Ask for the tools you need to make a decision or for a referral to someone who has been in a similar situation.

<br /><strong>Song of the Rain</strong>
<br /><br />I am dotted silver threads dropped from heaven
<br />By the gods. Nature then takes me, to adorn
<br />Her fields and valleys.
<br /><br />I am beautiful pearls, plucked from the
<br />Crown of Ishtar by the daughter of Dawn
<br />To embellish the gardens.
<br /><br />When I cry the hills laugh;
<br />When I humble myself the flowers rejoice;
<br />When I bow, all things are elated.
<br /><br />The field and the cloud are lovers
<br />And between them I am a messenger of mercy.
<br />I quench the thirst of one;
<br />I cure the ailment of the other.
<br /><br />The voice of thunder declares my arrival;
<br />The rainbow announces my departure.
<br />I am like earthly life, which begins at
<br />The feet of the mad elements and ends
<br />Under the upraised wings of death.
<br /><br />I emerge from the heard of the sea
<br />Soar with the breeze. When I see a field in
<br />Need, I descend and embrace the flowers and
<br />The trees in a million little ways.
<br /><br />I touch gently at the windows with my
<br />Soft fingers, and my announcement is a
<br />Welcome song. All can hear, but only
<br />The sensitive can understand.
<br /><br />The heat in the air gives birth to me,
<br />But in turn I kill it,
<br />As woman overcomes man with
<br />The strength she takes from him.
<br /><br />I am the sigh of the sea;
<br />The laughter of the field;
<br />The tears of heaven.
<br /><br />So with love -
<br />Sighs from the deep sea of affection;
<br />Laughter from the colorful field of the spirit;
<br />Tears from the endless heaven of memories.

<br /><strong></strong>A Persian painting by Mahmud Farshchian
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Khw?ja Šamsu d-D?n Mu?ammad H?fez-e Š?r?z? </strong></span>
<br />(Persian: <strong>????? ????????? ???? ???? ??????</strong>), known by his pen name H?fez (born 1315 - died 1390) was the most celebrated Persian lyric poet and is often described as a poet's poet. His collected works (Divan) are to be found in the homes of most Iranians, who learn his poems by heart and use them as proverbs and sayings to this day. His life and poems have been the subject of much analysis, commentary and interpretation, and have influenced post-Fourteenth Century Persian writing more than anything else has. 
<br />The major themes of his ghazals are love, the celebration of wine and intoxication, and exposing the hypocrisy of those who have set themselves up as guardians, judges and examples of moral rectitude.
<br />His presence in the lives of Iranians can be felt through Hafez-reading (f?l-e h?fez, Persian: ??? ????), frequent use of his poems in Persian traditional music, visual art and Persian calligraphy. His tomb in Shiraz is a masterpiece of Iranian architecture and visited often. Adaptations, imitations and translations of Hafez' poems exist in all major languages.
<br /><br /><strong>Ghazal</strong>
<br />Where is sensible action, &amp; my insanity whence?
<br />See the difference, it is from where to whence.
<br />From the church &amp; hypocritical vestments, I take offence
<br />Where is the abode of the Magi, &amp; sweet wine whence?
<br />For dervishes, piety and sensibility make no sense
<br />Where is sermon and hymn, &amp; the violin's music whence.
<br />Upon seeing our friend, our foes put up their defense
<br />Where is a dead lantern, &amp; the candle of the sun whence?
<br />My eye-liner is the dust of your door and fence
<br />Where shall I go, tell me, you command me whence?
<br />Take your focus from your chin to the trap on the path hence,
<br />Where to O heart, in such hurry you go whence?
<br />May his memory of union be happy and intense
<br />Where are your amorous gestures, &amp; your reproach whence?
<br />Make not restlessness &amp; insomnia, Hafiz's sentence
<br />What is rest, which is patience, and sleep whence?

<br /><br /><strong>3 Tips for Masterful Decision-Making </strong>
<br /><br />Whether you believe in making decisions swiftly and decisively or with more caution and deliberation, try these three tips to help you reach better conclusions and avoid decision-traps: 
<br /><br />1-<strong>Get the right minds on the job</strong>. Decision-making is the process of converting input into output. To make the best decision, optimize your input by getting the opinions and insights of trusted people who know the arena best. 
<br /><br />2- <strong>Decide how you will decide</strong>. Bickering often happens around the decision-making process. Be clear with yourself and others involved about the steps you will take to reach the decision. 
<br /><br />3-<strong>Demand diversity</strong>. Too much agreement is dangerous — you need dissenting opinions. Give a minority viewpoint a voice or appoint a devil's advocate. Listening to the &quot;other side&quot; will give you a more robust answer.

<br /><br />Most organizations limit or frown upon the use of social media in the workplace. Understandably, leaders have nightmarish visions of their employees wasting hours on Facebook and Twitter. But reasonable employee use of social media has actually been shown to benefit companies. Here are three reasons to let your employees get connected: 
<br /><br /><strong>1-More attractive workplace</strong>.
<br />Many people, especially younger generations, see social media as a staple of work life and seek out employers who understand and acknowledge the critical role these new technologies play in our world. 
<br /><strong>2-Improved productivity</strong>.
<br />Research has shown that employees who take breaks to surf the internet for fun are ultimately more productive than their surf-adverse colleagues. 
<br /><strong>3-More engaged workforce</strong>.
<br />Employees not only appreciate companies that allow them to check <strong>Facebook</strong> at work, but they also use social media to connect with colleagues, <strong>improve communication</strong>, and <strong>speed up decision making processes</strong> — all of which <strong>helps them engage with their work and the organization</strong>.

Reasons are usually something that is not within your control. But even then, the reason may become an excuse. The easiest way to show that is through this simple example. If you are late for an appointment due to a train or traffic, even though you left the house 15 minutes earlier than necessary—that is a reason. If you are late for an appointment due to traffic or a train, but you left the house late to start with—that is an excuse.
<br /><br />None of us wants to be “that person” who is always making excuses when the truth is, we just did not try hard enough to begin with.
<br />How many of us have had coworkers who have had an excuse every time anything did not work out or something went wrong? How many times have you heard the same excuses from the same people?
<br />Often times, there are valid reasons for failure or problems, and if so we should always state them. Just be sure they are a reason, and not an excuse.
<br />Life can be filled with excuses to the point that little is accomplished because it is easier to find an excuse than a reason.
<br /><br />Florence Nightingale, a British nurse and writer who lived from 1820 to 1910, once said “I attribute my success to this:
<br /> &quot;I never gave or took an excuse.” What a much better place this would be if we patterned after her. Determine today that from now on, your life will be ruled by reasons, not excuses.

<br /><br />Even if you recognize that you are unhappy in your job, it still may be tough — or even impossible in these economic times — to move on to a new position. Staying put may be your only option, but it doesn't have to make you miserable. Here are three things you can do make the most of an imperfect situation: 
<br /><br />1- Acknowledge your feelings. Be honest with yourself about what is making you unhappy. If you can't move on now, don't try to convince yourself that you're happy. Accept the situation and know you'll have to deal with it for the near future. 
<br /><br />2-Be proactive. If leaving your job isn't an option now, start preparing for the time when it will be. Learn a new skill or take on a tough project. 
<br /><br />3-Accentuate the positive. It's easy to focus only on the negative. Find good things about your job — a fun colleague, an interesting project — and let those provide you with the energy you need to hang in.

<br /><strong>International Mother Language Day 
<br />21 February </strong>
<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br /><strong>International Mother Language Day </strong>was proclaimed by UNESCO's General Conference in November 1999. The International Day has been observed every year since February 2000 to promote linguistic and cultural diversity and multilingualism. 
<br />Languages are the most powerful instruments of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage. All moves to promote the dissemination of mother tongues will serve not only to encourage linguistic diversity and multilingual education but also to develop fuller awareness of linguistic and cultural traditions throughout the world and to inspire solidarity based on understanding, tolerance and dialogue.

<br /><br />ILO celebrates <strong>International Women's Day 2010 - 8 March</strong>
<br />Each year, ILO celebrates International Women’s Day with an event honoring women of courage and conviction, from different aspects of the world of work. In 2010, the theme for ILO's celebration is «What’s working for working women! ».
<br />15 years have passed since the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing decided on a global platform for action on gender equality and women’s empowerment. ILO’s message to the Beijing Conference was «All Women are Working Women». And 8 March 2010 gives us the opportunity to share experiences on what successes have occurred since then. The distinguished panel brought together for this year’s celebration will share success stories, and highlight some remaining challenges, towards achieving true gender equality in the world of work.
<br />Gender equality is a human rights issue necessary for achieving sustainable and people-centred development. The Beijing Platform of Action states that: 
<br /><br />&quot;<strong>Empowerment of women and equality between women and men are prerequisites for achieving political, social, economic, cultural and environmental security among all peoples</strong>&quot;.

<br />By Erin Pavlina
<br />When I was in grade school I really enjoyed lying.  Not the white lies you tell your mom when you ate cookies that you weren’t supposed to.  I’m talking about the elaborate lies you tell friends to make yourself appear to be better than you are.  I remember convincing my friends in 3rd grade that my father was the President of Coca Cola.  I remember convincing my friends in 5th grade that I had gone deaf in one ear.  That was a lot of fun.  As I got older, my lying continued.  I enjoyed people’s reactions to my seemingly amazing life.  When I was 15 that all changed.  I met someone I really looked up to (he was 17).  He became a mentor for me as I began my foray into the astral world.  He’s the one who helped me raise my vibration so the “ookie spookies” wouldn’t bother me.  He’s the one who put me on the path of honesty and integrity.  And he did it by hurting me so badly that I changed instantly.  Here’s what happened.
<br />In my usual fashion, I told him lies just like I had been telling other people.  I made up elaborate stories to get him to be more interested in me because I wasn’t sure the truth would be enough to make him want to continue working with me.  But he knew me so well, probably better than I knew myself.  One day he told me, “<strong>I can’t talk to you on the phone anymore because I can’t see your eyes and so I’m not sure when you’re lying to me.</strong>”  That really shocked me.  One, because I didn’t know he knew I had been lying to him sometimes, and two, because he was willing to end our friendship over those lies.  I vowed in that moment that I would never lie to him again.  It was a hard transition for me to make because I was used to exaggerating stories and experiences to get attention.  But for him, and for his wise counsel, I made a pact with myself never to tell even one single white lie to him again.  In time, his trust in me was rebuilt and we enjoyed a great friendship and relationship.
<br />That’s how I learned the value of honesty.  I decided that I would honor the truth.  I decided that the truth was powerful and strong, and that lies merely created a false foundation that could crumble at the slightest poking.  I realized that I felt more powerful when I told the truth.  I felt like I was helping to build reality instead of creating a false Matrix-like reality.  As Merlin said in the movie, Excalibur, to Arthur, “When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.”  It’s true.  Every lie you tell alters the universe and makes it unreal.
<br /><br />So never do something you will have to lie about later.  If you have to lie about it, you shouldn’t be doing it.
<br />After all, if you feel good about what you’re doing, why would you lie about it?  Don’t we lie when we are ashamed of who we are or what we’ve done? 
<br />Make your life something you don’t need to lie about.  <strong>Value truth and honesty</strong>.  Decide from this day forward that you will be completely honest and truthful in all your dealings (with others and yourself).  Imagine what our world would be like if no one lied.  Help create that world by honoring the truth.

<br /><strong>Sheikh Muslihu'd-Din</strong>, known as <strong>Saadi</strong>, was descended from Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed. Saadi's father apparently died when he was a boy.
<br /><br />Although Saadi was born and died in Shiraz, Iran, during his life he traveled extensively. He is said to have traveled for thirty years throughout the Islamic world. Iran has filled the centuries with some of the world's finest poets, but Iranians consider Saadi to be one of the greatest.
<br /><br />Historians often divide his life into three parts. His first twenty-five years were spent studying in various countries, going to university at Baghdad. During the next thirty years he traveled widely, east to India and as far west as Syria. He made his pilgrimage to Mecca fourteen times. Finally, Saadi returned to Shiraz where he devoted himself to writing and to teaching.
<br /><br />Saadi's two best known works are the <strong>Bustan</strong> (the Garden), composed entirely in verse, and the <strong>Gulistan</strong> (the Rose Garden), in both prose and verse. He was particularly known for the wry wit he injected into his poems.
<br /><br />Saadi is probably the first Persian poet to have been translated into European languages. A German version of the Gulistan appeared in 1654.
<br /><br />Saadi's tomb can be seen in the town of Shiraz. Lines from Saadi's poems are still commonly used in conversations by Iranians today.
<br /><br /><strong>Saadi Poem</strong>
<br /><br /><em>All Adam's race are members of one frame;
<br />Since all, at first, from the same essence came.
<br />When by hard fortune one limb is oppressed,
<br />The other members lose their wonted rest:
<br />If thou feel's not for others' misery,
<br />A son of Adam is no name for thee.</em>

<br /><br />“Cultural officials have not carried out their duties properly in the field of children’s literature… no progress has been shown in this field over the past few years,” he added. 
<br /><br />Rahmandust, who is the director of the children’s section of the Iran National Library and Archives, said that book reading should be encouraged by families and it should then be reinforced by organizations such as the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults. 
<br /><br />“Book reading is not approached professionally in Iran. Neither is a writer able to earn a living as a writer, nor is a publisher hopeful about the outcomes of his/her work. Also, families are not enthusiastic about the books that are being published,” he lamented. 
<br /><br />Various figures have been published about Iran’s per capita book reading rate over the past six years. 
<br /><br />In April 2008, then director of the Iran National Library and Archives Ali-Akbar Ash’ari lamented the lack of proper reading facilities and a shortage of the latest publications in Iran’s libraries. 
<br /><br />He announced that Iran’s per capita book reading rate is two minutes in every 24 hours. 
<br /><br />Ash’ari was censured for his remarks by some Iranian officials. Afterwards, they began to give higher rates for Iran’s per capita book reading. 
<br /><br />The general director of the public libraries of Gilan Province announced on Saturday that Iran’s per capita book reading rate is 74 minutes in every 24 hours. 
<br /><br /><strong>With a 84-minute per capita book reading rate, Gilan is “the most cultured province of Iran”</strong>, Mohammad Ahmadipur told the Persian service of the Mehr News Agency.

<br />Despite traditional beliefs about what makes men and women happy in relationships, a new study found that kissing, cuddling and caressing are more important to men than they are to women. 
<br /><br />The researchers, from The Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Ind., were also surprised to find that more men reported being happy in their relationships while more women reported being sexually satisfied.
