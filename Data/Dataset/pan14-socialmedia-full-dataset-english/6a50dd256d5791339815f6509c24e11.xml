Judo is great for mixed martial arts because it focuses on closing distance and shooting in for take downs so your able to slam your opponent on his back helplessly.<br /><br />If you want to increase the level of your MMA game and your not a closed-minded idiot, consider learning some Judo to have even more weapons to use.<br /><br />Here are the top 5 reasons you should learn Judo if you fight or partake in MMA.<br /><br />5.) A high percentage of fights end up in a clinch at some point - if you know the right judo techniques youll be able to powerfully throw your opponent or sweep his legs out from underneath him to gain valuable position on the ground<br /><br />4.) Your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu will get better with Judo practice because a lot of the major grappling positions are similar. The guard and half guard are well known judo techniques, so learning this and a combination of BJJ will improve your MMA game drastically. Not to mention there are various chokes to make your opponent gasp for air too. (even more so in the Judo Gi/Kimono)<br /><br />3.) If your having trouble exchanging strikes because you suck at muay thai the shooting/take-down techniques for judo can be of help to close the distance so you dont have to worry about getting pummeled in the face repeatedly. With shooting you can gain dominant position in the clinch and work your striking from there, or use one of the many judo take downs to slam him on his back.<br /><br />2.) Practicing Judo (especially in a judo gi/kimono) will improve your foot work, body positioning and stand up game because of the agility, speed and balance you need in order to perform some of the judo throws and techniques. Your hips will drastically improve too, which in turn will help take your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling to the next level.<br /><br />1.) Wrist locks, foot locks, arm locks and knee locks are all essential techniques of Judo that can help end an MMA fight quickly. Learning all these joint lock techniques can improve your all around submission game and make your opponent think twice before messing with you in the clinch or on the ground. <br /><br />Judo can be useful and effective for any type of fighter, whether your base is at wrestling, striking or ground fighting - it can help improve all three areas of your game. Although almost all Judo competition is done in a kimono or gi, there are still plenty of techniques to learn.<br /><br />The growth of judo in mixed martial arts has been apparent, with MMA fighters always looking for new ways to improve their game. Karo Parisyan, Fedor Emelianenko, Dong-Sik Yoon and more have quality Judo backgrounds that have helped them in their MMA career. Although not many MMA fighters have extensive backgrounds in Judo, most do have basic knowledge of the throws, techniques, chokes, holds and locks that are useful in the octagon.<br /><br />The key is to never stop learning, never be content with what you know now... always be looking for new techniques to improve your overall MMA or mixed martial arts game.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXJlY3RvcmlzZS5jb20vbGlzdGluZy81NzA2MDEtU28tV2hvLVJlYWxseS1OZWVkcy1BLVBhcnQtT2YtSG91c3Rvbi1NTUEtZ3ltcy1NYXJ0aWFsLWFydHMtdHJhaW5pbmctSG91c3Rvbi1CZXN0LU1NQS1neW0tSG91c3Rvbi1DbGljay1oZXJlLUZpbmQtb3V0LW1vcmUuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Who Else Is Wishing For A Chunk Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NpbXBlcnFpYW4ucG9kb21hdGljLmNvbS9lbnRyeS8yMDEyLTA5LTI3VDA0XzQxXzU0LTA3XzAw" target="_blank">So, Who Will Want Some Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb29kcmVhZHMuY29tL2V2ZW50L3Nob3cvNzMzMDYzLXNvLXdoby1zaG91bGQtaGF2ZS1hLXBpZWNlLW9mLWhvdXN0b24tbW1hLWd5bXMtbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLXRyYWluaW5nLWhv" target="_blank">Who Else Is Looking To Get A Chunk Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>

For this reason alone people are turning to the internet as there is so much to choose from especially in the MMA Gear genre of clothing. It can be quite a difficult for some people to check their emails never mind actually shopping online but the internet is (for most people) the only source available to buy the correct gear and as you progress further with your MMA career it will become essential to have the correct gear. If you are one of those people lacking in confidence and trust for the internet, here are a few things to look out for to give you a bit more peace of mind and if you find the right retailer online the process should be fairly easy.<br /><br />You may search online for a reputable MMA clothing store but to recognise a good site you must take note of them having good product descriptions, easy navigation and clear pictures. Its no good having to swap from store to store to get the information you need as that is just too time consuming. Alternatively you could search for phrases such as MMA rash vests or any other product you are looking for.<br /><br />So this being said you need to use a search engine you trust, Google is the biggest search engine on the internet listing millions more websites than any other. Usually a good brand will be listed in Googles shopping results as well as ranking on the first and second pages of results. <br /><br />Ok, so now that you have conquered searching for the sites and you are confident enough to go deeper, you need to make sure the products you are looking for are reasonably priced. Be cautious if the prices are a steal and happen to be very low. That could be a sign that they are of a low quality and after all you are going to be fighting in these products and enduring the rigours of training, so the cheaper option is not always the best. You may find that you have to replace cheaper items of clothing more often than something you spend a little bit more on. That being said you dont want to be ripped off either so set yourself a budget of how much you are willing to spend but it would be advised not to jeopardise the quality for the sake of saving a few .<br /><br />If you still arent 100% sure then look for product reviews in Google. It is likely if somebody has had a bad experience with a company or a good experience they will write about it and want to share it so you will always be well informed. Some companies are so confident in their products they allow independent reviews that they cannot moderate themselves. So it is definitely worth researching before you buy. It could save you money and time in the long run.<br /><br />Last thing if you are a member of a social networking site such as Facebook or Twitter then check to see if the company has their own profiles, you may find product reviews on their MMA Clothes as well as discount codes and special offers for their followers.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jZW9mdXNpb24ub3JnL25vZGUvNTA0NTA3" target="_blank">So, Who Really Wants A Part Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9ub3plYmFuaml3ZTA5Ny9wb3N0cy8yNDk2NzI3L1NvJTJDK1dobytJcytIb3BpbmcrRm9yK0ErUGFydCtPZitIb3VzdG9uK01NQStneW1zK01hcnRpYWwrYXJ0cyt0cmFpbmluZytIb3VzdG9uKytCZXN0K01NQStneW0rSG91c3RvbitDbGljaytoZXJlK0ZpbmQrb3V0K21vcmUrJTNG" target="_blank">So, Who Really Needs A Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTkwNDY0X3dob19lbHNlX2lzX3dpc2hpbmdfZm9yX2Ffam9pbnRfb2ZfaG91c3Rvbl9tbWFfZ3ltc19tYXJ0aWFsX2FydHNfdHJhaW5pbmdfaG91c3Rvbl9iZXN0X21tYV9neW1faG91c3Rvbl9jbGlja19oZXJlX2ZpbmRfb3V0X21vcmU_" target="_blank">Who Else Really Needs Some Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>

It also happens to be one of the most complex.<br /><br />Epoxy is a very unforgiving substance used to secure joints that hardens quickly. Once it moves past the phase where it is pliable and workable, it is all but impossible to remove. The only &quot;do overs&quot; with epoxy are in the form of scraping the joint and starting again from scratch. <br /><br />Because of this fact, you'll want to follow these tips for getting every joint done right the first time.<br /><br />Safety First<br /><br />If you've ever seen dried epoxy, you can just imagine how difficult it would be to try and remove it from a piece of wood. Now imagine attempting to get if off the skin on your hand or arm. Likewise, the sanding dust that comes from some epoxies can be dangerous if inhaled. <br /><br />In order to work safely, be sure you have the following on hand or nearby at all times when working with epoxy.<br /><br />Rubber gloves to wear during the process<br /><br />Cleaning solvent made for the type/brand of epoxy you're working with<br /><br />Warm, soapy water<br /><br />Mask to help you avoid inhaling epoxy dust<br /><br />Work Fast<br /><br />Depending on the type/brand of epoxy you use, it could completely cure within five to 60 minutes. Read the label of your product for more exact times. Some specialty epoxies are made that cure more slowly in hot climates. If this applies to you, be sure to ask the representative if s/he sells tropical epoxy. <br /><br />Practice Makes Perfect<br /><br />Using a few scraps of wood, do a test run or two. This way you can actually get the feel for the epoxy you're using before you make a permanent commitment. Cure times vary with the mixing formula, temperature and many other variables. All of these cause the behavior of the epoxy to be particular to your work environment. Conducting a trial will allow you to experiment before applying the glue to your boat.<br /><br />Prep and Fit<br /><br />Once you're ready to move forward, take time to do the necessary prep work. The surfaces of your boat that you plan to bond should be free of grease, oil, wax, mold and dust. Clean the surfaces thoroughly before you apply epoxy.<br /><br />In order for the epoxy to adhere, the surface must be completely dry. If you've used liquid solvents to clean your boat, you can allow them to air dry or use a blow dryer or hot air gun to speed the process.<br /><br />Lastly, sand the surfaces as smooth as possible. There should be no flaking, cracking, blistering, old paint or stain, etc. on the wood. Be sure and remove all dust after sanding.<br /><br />Lastly, double-check your joints. Check that they are smooth and fit snuggly without large gaps. If you find any cracking, flaking or splintering, sand the surfaces again before applying the epoxy.<br /><br />The majority of time spent with applying epoxy is done up front. Be patient, read the instructions that come with the product you'll be using and work methodically. When you do, you'll produce a boat you can confidently and proudly sail for years to come.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jZW9mdXNpb24ub3JnL25vZGUvNTA0NTA3" target="_blank">Who Else Is Hoping For A Bit Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYWR2aWxsZS5jb20vYmxvZ3MvNTkwNDY0X3dob19lbHNlX2lzX3dpc2hpbmdfZm9yX2Ffam9pbnRfb2ZfaG91c3Rvbl9tbWFfZ3ltc19tYXJ0aWFsX2FydHNfdHJhaW5pbmdfaG91c3Rvbl9iZXN0X21tYV9neW1faG91c3Rvbl9jbGlja19oZXJlX2ZpbmRfb3V0X21vcmU_" target="_blank">Who Really Needs Some Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NpbXBlcnFpYW4ucG9kb21hdGljLmNvbS9lbnRyeS8yMDEyLTA5LTI3VDA0XzM3XzU2LTA3XzAw" target="_blank">So, Who Would Like A Chunk Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>

Only the experienced fighter or an MMA fanatic, know about the importance of rash guards during fighting competitions and practice sessions. They are a part of MMA and BJJ clothing as well which provides protection from the opponents or from the training associate as this protective shirt is very difficult to grab onto it. Also, they are designed in such a way to soak up the moisture from the body and help the fighter stay cool.<br /><br />The idea behind wearing a rash guard is that the athlete will sweat less and maintain a balanced body temperature during the course of training sessions and actual competition. As with the best possible circumstances the athlete can continue to focus on the technique and skill to achieve best possible results. The outfits are designed to fit closely to the body and hence customers are recommended to order sizes similar to what they normally wear in a t-shirt.<br /><br />Multiple Martial Art or MMA Rash Guards are quite valuable as they are thick than a normal t-shirt, they usually protect form rough corners of the mat, and from the finger nails of the co-fighters. A cut or a scratch can lead to severe infections due to the sweat and high temperature during competitive matches or at the gym. These infections can result in ringworms or staphs.<br /><br />Along with the advantage of greater protection to infections, the use of rash guards also enhances the workout conditions. The fabric of the guards draws the sweat away from the body to the outer layer to evaporate; this process allows the body to cool itself faster. Rash guards are also popular in the surfing sphere; it protects the body from the effects of salt water. These guards are becoming a trend in many other domains; they are used in combination with board shorts and other exercising material to make a comfortable outfit.<br /><br />Before purchasing the MMA Rash Guards it is necessary to determine the sleeve length. The selection of a sleeve length is ones personal choice. A short sleeved guard is good for staying as cool as possible, at the same time a long sleeved rash guard gives increased overall protection. Most of the brands like Manto, Everlast, TapouT, Venum, Sprawl, Bad Boy and Hayabusa Fightwear offer both short-sleeved and long sleeved varieties in rash guards.<br /><br />The best quality rash guards will not be available down street. One has to look out for the options on the internet. Even if you are not looking for stuff that is designed for MMA, make sure to purchase the gears from the retailers that are focused on selling MMA products as they have the best quality products.<br /><br />Some brands stand out in certain models for instance short sleeve guards manufactured by sprawl are worth buying. They have special contrived fabric which is designed to dry off the moisture from the athlete wearing it as well as it repels the sweat from the opponent. These designs are of great advantages for those who want to stay comfortable as they wrestle with their co-fighters. A number of other manufacturers offer a huge variety in designs and comfort ability.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5wdXJldm9sdW1lLmNvbS9iaWhpd294YmF6YTcyNS9wb3N0cy8yNDk2NzQ4L1dobytJcytMb29raW5nK0ZvcitBK1BpZWNlK09mK0hvdXN0b24rTU1BK2d5bXMrTWFydGlhbCthcnRzK3RyYWluaW5nK0hvdXN0b24rK0Jlc3QrTU1BK2d5bStIb3VzdG9uK0NsaWNrK2hlcmUrRmluZCtvdXQrbW9yZSslM0Y_" target="_blank">Who Else Is Looking To Get A Part Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NpbXBlcnFpYW4ucG9kb21hdGljLmNvbS9lbnRyeS8yMDEyLTA5LTI3VDA0XzM5XzU1LTA3XzAw" target="_blank">Who Else Wishes For Some Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2NvbW11bml0eS5iYWJ5Y2VudGVyLmNvbS9qb3VybmFsL2Jlc293YXBtaW1lMTgxLzYyODI3Njkvc29fd2hvX2lzX3dpc2hpbmdfZm9yX2FfcGFydF9vZl9ob3VzdG9uX21tYV9neW1zX21hcnRpYWxfYXJ0c190cmFpbmluZ19ob3VzdG9uX2Jlc3RfbW1hX2d5bV9ob3VzdG9uX2NsaWNrX2hlcmVfZmluZF9vdXRfbW9yZQ__" target="_blank">So, Who Want A Joint Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>

It involves a mixture of popular sports, including the Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, judo, wresting and others. It has become so popular that manufacturers of MMA headgear have come out. This headwear can protect your face from head or facial injuries and bad weather conditions. Most of them are made of lightweight materials, such as foam pads and mesh for proper aeration.<br /><br />Since there are many companies today, you may be best doing a through research first . This is a simple and direct task because of the Internet. Look for MMA equipment and accessory shops and websites that provide related information. Most specifically, look for reviews and read them properly. They can give you tips and hints regarding different types of MMA headgear models. <br /><br />Will you be buying these items for the first time? If true, you need to know a few factors that would guide you through the procedure. First, look for safe and comfortable gear. Closure details such as Velcro, straps and buttons can give a sign that a product is safe or unsafe. These closure features enhance how the headwear fits the wearer's head tightly even if he or she receives a hard blow. <br /><br />The material used to make the item can indicate whether it would be comfortable next to the skin. Most of them are made of super soft leather material, which soothes the skin, of course. The other consideration is the level of protection that an item would offer. Does it safeguard the whole head or just the chin, cheeks, ears, or forehead? The most reliable accessory should protect the player's head entirely. <br /><br />Additionally, it has to be strong enough to withstand hard battering with boxing gloves. The area around the cheeks has thick cushions to protect the wearer's face. At the same time, this cushioning is set in a way it cannot block one's vision while playing MMA sports. Another imperative detail is the quality of craftsmanship. It is very important to buy equipment that would last longer and still serve its purpose. <br /><br />Thus, you must check the quality of the materials used to make a given headwear. If the material is leather, then it is up to you to make sure that it has excellent quality. Stitching appearance can tell you if an MMA headdress would last longer or not. A new item should lack unraveled stitching, and should not give you a reason to believe that the stitches would soon slacken off. <br /><br />An inner lining is another indication that an item would be reliable. If made of a material such as suede, this lining can hold the entire headgear in place and prevent sliding. Do not just get any other headwear you find in the marketplace. Consider the fashion detail and your tastes and preferences, of course. These products come in many different colors, sizes, designs, features and so on. You need to choose that will obviously enhance your training and most importantly keep you properly protected. <br /><br />G.

He is the Russian heavyweight MMA fighter and is the current World Alliance of Mixed Martial Arts Heavyweight Champion and the last holder of the Pride Heavyweight Championship. Fedor holds an impressive accolade of winnings in numerous tournaments in multiple sports. Some of note was his victory in the Pride 2004 Grand Prix and the World Combat Sambo championship on four separate occasions. He has also medaled in the Russian National Judo Championship.<br /><br />Emelianenko began fighting learning the Sambo and Judo techniques. He trained under Vasiliy Ivanovich Gavrilov initially and then later learned under his grappling coach, Vladimir Mihailovich Voronov. His coaches remember how weak he was when he was 10 years old, but Emelianenkos greatest strength at that time and today was his perseverance and strong will. <br /><br />Fedor received the Mastor of Sports title in Sambo and Judo in 1997 and became part of the Russian National Team. On this team he earned a bronze medal in 1998 in the Russian Judo Championship and then started to study striking under Coach Alexander Vasilievich Michkov. Fedor started to compete in Sambo mixed martial arts in 2000 at the age of 25 because he says that he had run out of money at that time. He also made his MMA debut for the Japanese RINGS organization which did not allow Fedor to make head strikes, which is one of his strongest points as a fighter. <br /><br />Currently, Emelianenko trains two or three times a day to maintain his strength and to improve his skills. Fedor used to weight train excessively, but in 1997 he completely substituted his weight building exercises with sport specific training in grappling, boxing, and kickboxing. His daily strength training consists of pull ups, dips, and crunches. He also runs twice a day and tries to cover 7-9 miles a day. He also enjoys high altitude training which causes him to travel to Kislovodsk once or twice a year with his team. With all these training techniques, he has just recently published a book going over all of these unique training techniques.<br /><br />Emelianenko has several people on his team, some of which include: grappling coach Voronov, boxing coach Michkiv, Muay Thai coach Ruslan Nagnibeda, Doctor Oleg Neustroev, and his training partners Roman Zentsov, and his brother Aleksander.<br /><br />Fedor defended his World Comba Sambo Championship title in 2007. His opponent failed to show up which gave him a bye into the semifinals. There he choked out a Bulgarian fighter in 40 seconds of the fight starting. The other finalist declined to even fight which gave Emelianenko the default victory. Fedors first loss in Sambo over eight years came on November 16, 2008 at the Combat Sambo World Championships in St. Petersburg Russia. He finished this tournament in third place when he lost to 23 year old Bulgarian Blagoi Ivanov. <br /><br />Emelianenko won the gold at the Tussian Combat Sambo Championship on February 21, 2009. He also just released a book called Fedor: The Fighting System of the Worlds undisputed King of MMA which goes over his unique fighting styles.  <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuQmFtQmFtTWFydGlhbGFydHMuY29tLw__" target="_blank">Find out more</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsQXJ0cy5jb20_" target="_blank">MMA Houston</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5CYW1CYW1NYXJ0aWFsYXJ0cy5jb20v" target="_blank">Mixed martial arts training Houston</a>

Judo is great for mixed martial arts because it focuses on closing distance and shooting in for take downs so your able to slam your opponent on his back helplessly.<br /><br />If you want to increase the level of your MMA game and your not a closed-minded idiot, consider learning some Judo to have even more weapons to use.<br /><br />Here are the top 5 reasons you should learn Judo if you fight or partake in MMA.<br /><br />5.) A high percentage of fights end up in a clinch at some point - if you know the right judo techniques youll be able to powerfully throw your opponent or sweep his legs out from underneath him to gain valuable position on the ground<br /><br />4.) Your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu will get better with Judo practice because a lot of the major grappling positions are similar. The guard and half guard are well known judo techniques, so learning this and a combination of BJJ will improve your MMA game drastically. Not to mention there are various chokes to make your opponent gasp for air too. (even more so in the Judo Gi/Kimono)<br /><br />3.) If your having trouble exchanging strikes because you suck at muay thai the shooting/take-down techniques for judo can be of help to close the distance so you dont have to worry about getting pummeled in the face repeatedly. With shooting you can gain dominant position in the clinch and work your striking from there, or use one of the many judo take downs to slam him on his back.<br /><br />2.) Practicing Judo (especially in a judo gi/kimono) will improve your foot work, body positioning and stand up game because of the agility, speed and balance you need in order to perform some of the judo throws and techniques. Your hips will drastically improve too, which in turn will help take your Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Wrestling to the next level.<br /><br />1.) Wrist locks, foot locks, arm locks and knee locks are all essential techniques of Judo that can help end an MMA fight quickly. Learning all these joint lock techniques can improve your all around submission game and make your opponent think twice before messing with you in the clinch or on the ground. <br /><br />Judo can be useful and effective for any type of fighter, whether your base is at wrestling, striking or ground fighting - it can help improve all three areas of your game. Although almost all Judo competition is done in a kimono or gi, there are still plenty of techniques to learn.<br /><br />The growth of judo in mixed martial arts has been apparent, with MMA fighters always looking for new ways to improve their game. Karo Parisyan, Fedor Emelianenko, Dong-Sik Yoon and more have quality Judo backgrounds that have helped them in their MMA career. Although not many MMA fighters have extensive backgrounds in Judo, most do have basic knowledge of the throws, techniques, chokes, holds and locks that are useful in the octagon.<br /><br />The key is to never stop learning, never be content with what you know now... always be looking for new techniques to improve your overall MMA or mixed martial arts game.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvcGcvYmxvZy9qZXh5dnV4cXV2aTUyMy9yZWFkLzEwNjk0NTcxL3doby1lbHNlLXdhbnQtYS1waWVjZS1vZi1ob3VzdG9uLW1tYS1neW1zLW1hcnRpYWwtYXJ0cy10cmFpbmluZy1ob3VzdG9uLWJlc3QtbW1hLWd5bS1ob3VzdG9uLWNsaWNrLWhlcmUtZmluZC1vdXQtbW9yZS0_" target="_blank">So, Who Will Want A Joint Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/frydrykrensing/blog/blogid=12426916" target="_blank">Who Would Love A Part Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N1anVreXJzeXRhNDU2LmRtdXNpYy5uZXQvam91cm5hbC8xNjI0NjQ0" target="_blank">Who Else Should Have A Bit Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>

In the following article, I have outlined general guidelines, and precautions, for parents who are considering enrolling their child, or children, into martial arts.<br /><br />Below, I have listed some common issues and questions that parents often ask about martial arts for their children. Also, you will be much more informed about the benefits of martial arts, the structure with a martial arts school, and know what to realistically expect.<br /><br />What should I be looking for in a martial arts school?<br /> Safety comes as a first priority for parents who seek <br /> martial arts instruction for their children. Here are a number of key factors to consider:<br /><br />Is safety equipment used when children are performing <br /> exercises and drills that require contact? This is <br /> especially important when children are sparring in martial arts. In many martial arts schools, sparring equipment is required, or the child cannot spar. The number of injuries resulting from sparring in Karate, Kung Fu, and Tae Kwon Do is surprisingly low in comparison to many league sports.<br /><br />Never the less, I once had a father pull his son out of our martial arts school because he found a karate studio that would let his son &quot;fight&quot; without protective equipment. In our school, it is mandatory to wear martial arts equipment for the safety of the students. Sparring equipment has come a long way, so why not use it?<br /><br />The flooring surface should match the martial art. If take downs, sweeps, and throws are required, there should be some kind of matted floor available. Many of the state-of-the-art martial arts schools have a floor surface specifically designed for martial arts. It makes no sense to have anyone throw a classmate on a hard floor, with the type of flooring available, as this can result in long-term injuries.<br /><br />Can parents watch Karate classes?<br /><br />Let's put it this way, if you cannot watch your child <br /> practice karate, or any other martial art, you should find another school. I can appreciate the fact that some martial arts instructors don't want to deal with interfering parents. This is the reason for rules and signs.<br /><br />Remember the &quot;hockey dad&quot; incident? There are a few people who, through their own conduct, create rules for the rest of us. However, you are the parent and are entitled to see your child train in karate or any martial arts class.<br /><br />Fire exits, fire extinguishers, and someone who monitors visitors, as they enter a karate studio full of children, should be standard features. We have three fire exits and one main entrance, in our studio, but only one door is used for an entrance. Kids understand security because they see the same precautions in elementary school.<br /><br />Also, watch out for poles in the middle of the room. Adults will spot them, but an excited child in a karate class may forget and end up crashing into one. Make sure that you feel secure about the studio, surroundings, rules, and the staff before you make a decision to have your child take martial arts classes.<br /><br />Copyright 2005 Paul Jerard / Aura Publications<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5taWdlbnRlLmNvbS95b3VyX3BhZ2UvYmxvZy92aWV3X3Bvc3RpbmcuaHRtbD9waWQ9MzU2MDM2OSZhbXA7cHJvZmlsZV9pZD03Njg1NDQ2JmFtcDtwcm9maWxlX25hbWU9a3lyb2JhdGd1anU5MjAmYW1wO3VzZXJfaWQ9NzY4NTQ0NiZhbXA7dXNlcm5hbWU9a3lyb2JhdGd1anU5MjA_" target="_blank">Who Else Is Looking For A Chunk Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/sybrandfiroozbakht/blog/blogid=12391521" target="_blank">So, Who Needs A Bit Of Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvcGcvYmxvZy9udW1lam9tZGFtbzUyMi9yZWFkLzEwNjk1MDEwL3doby1lbHNlLWhvcGVzLWZvci1hLWNodW5rLW9mLWhvdXN0b24tbW1hLWd5bXMtbWFydGlhbC1hcnRzLXRyYWluaW5nLWhvdXN0b24tYmVzdC1tbWEtZ3ltLWhvdXN0b24tY2xpY2staGVyZS1maW5kLW91dC1tb3JlLQ__" target="_blank">Who Want Some Houston MMA gyms Martial arts training Houston  Best MMA gym Houston Click here Find out more ?</a>
