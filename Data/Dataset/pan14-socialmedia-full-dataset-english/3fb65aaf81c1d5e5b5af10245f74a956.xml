<br />biggest jungle parties in Paris In 2003 she met Anakyne (UnderPressure Records) 
<br />who had heard her singing and proposed her to sing in some of his mixes. 
<br />In 2005 Anakyne was working with LaVibe.org in a monthly project party 
<br />and gave her the chance to be the resident vocalist next to OTIS (Under Pressure Recs / Black Label Recs)
<br />FX909 (Touchin' Down / Defunked), ANAKYNE (Under Pressure Recs / New Hope Recs) 
<br />MC DIGICLA (until january 2006) and then alongside of RASLION MC from Hotstepper Crew. 
<br />It was at this moment that she met FX909.She accepted to work on some of his tunes. 
<br /><br />Since her debut, Miss DROP has already worked in collaboration with  many d'n'b dj's and producers.
