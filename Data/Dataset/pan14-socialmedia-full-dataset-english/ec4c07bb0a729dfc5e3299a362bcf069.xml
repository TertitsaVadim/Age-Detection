This interface, which is like the original MS-DOS interface, can be hard to realize to a internet site newbie. Also, in order to maintain a UNIX machine stable, one particular need to update the kernel and software regularly, a process which is far more challenging than Windows.  This however, can be produced just as simple to do if your web host has very good administration software program.<br /><br />Another thing to think about when selecting which operating system to use is whether you will be employing scripting. If so what type? For example, if you will be making use of a dynamic internet site, and decide that you want to go Perl as your language of decision then UNIX should be your operating technique of decision. This is also accurate for languages such as PHP, and Pythlon. On the other hand, if you choose to go for an ASP based site then you should select <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbnRydXN0Lm5ldC8_" target="_blank">wildcard ssl certificate</a> Windows. Nevertheless, to complicate the matter additional some UNIX systems can run ASP scripts, although the top quality of the script execution can be lesser.<br /><br />Bare in thoughts that if you pick a Windows-based net server (this does not apply to hosting accounts as the host really should take care of it for you) you will need to update the software program with patches from Microsoft's net internet site almost weekly to avoid your web site from getting exploited. UNIX administrators will only have to do so monthly or so as UNIX is more secure by nature, and wants fewer patches and computer software updates.<br /><br />Unix operating systems are normally the preferred operating program, however, in the end, if you do every thing properly, a UNIX hosted internet site and a Windows hosted web site will function somewhat equally, and each should make you happy. Be certain to maintain operating expenses and maintained in mind when producing your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5lbnRydXN0Lm5ldC9ldi1zc2wtY2VydGlmaWNhdGUuaHRt" target="_blank">ev ssl certificate</a> decision and you will not regret it.
