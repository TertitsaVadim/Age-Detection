This was to serve as a reminder that alcohol is ever-present in society, especially for people who are actively seeking treatment for addiction. 
<br /><br />Although the bottle of wine is long gone, AA is now a fixture in communities around the world. There are more than 270 groups using the 12-step method or “anonymous” in their titles, and the “Big Book,” AA’s printed guidelines outlining the 12 steps, has been translated into 28 languages. 
<br /><br />Addiction Treatment: 12 Steps That Start With One Purpose 
<br />One of the key principles of AA, “singleness of purpose,” is the likely reason for the growth of so many 12-step groups for all kinds of addictions. Singleness of purpose means that when the group meets, they must limit their discussion to alcohol or the substance in question. These types of groups are thought to be most effective when people are sharing with others who come from a similar background; this also led to creating distinct kinds of groups to meet those different needs. 
<br /><br />For example, people who have an addiction to an illegal drug may have different life experiences than people who are addicted to alcohol, even though all addiction is basically the same at its root. Narcotics Anonymous (NA) developed in response to the need for a place to discuss more than one addiction. Since then, programs have grown in response to gambling, sex, overeating, and a variety of other addictions. 
<br /><br />Addiction Treatment: Who Needs a 12-Step Program? 
<br />“Generally people with more severe problems are more likely to go and more likely to be helped. Someone who can lick the problem on their own, which by definition means they are not medically diagnosable, won’t go,” says Alexandre Laudet, PhD, director of the Center for the Study of Addictions and Recovery at the National Development and Research Institutes in New York City. 
<br /><br />The problem is that many people who actually do need to get into addiction treatment also believe they can take care of the problem on their own — the classic state of denial that must be overcome before starting a 12-step program. 
<br /><br />Another reason 12-step programs are so popular and successful, says Laudet, is that they offer a supportive network of friends to people who are going through a very stressful period in addiction treatment and recovery at a time in their life when they may have to cut off their former addict friends and even family if they want to be successful. 
<br /><br />“Very early on, if you don’t cut yourself from your drinking or drug buddies, you’re not going to have a chance. So at the moment where you need the most support, you have the least,” says Laudet. This is when the other members of a 12-step group can step in and fill that important role. 
<br /><br />Addiction Treatment: When to Begin a 12-Step Program 
<br />Many addiction treatment centers include a 12-step program in their treatment plan. For instance, participating in a 12-step program is a core part of treatment at A Better Tomorrow drug addiction treatment center in Murietta, Calif. 
<br /><br />“We require our clients to get a temporary sponsor,” explains Jim Fent, clinical director at the center. They then go to the 12-step group that meets on the center’s grounds. The hope is that clients will continue with their 12-step program after treatment. “It gives them something else to do, a sober support system.” 
<br /><br />Michael J., a former client of the center, agrees that joining a 12-step program is necessary for long-term success. “I am very thankful for what I learned in treatment. I endeavor to put this knowledge into application in my life as much as I can,” he explains. “AA is the extension of this center’s program.” 
<br /><br />Whether Gambling Anonymous, AA, NA, or any other type of 12-step program, recovery after addiction treatment is more likely to be successful if you become an active participant in one of these groups.

Can you recall times when you daydreamed or had difficulty focusing on the task at hand?
<br /><br />Most of us can picture acting this way from time to time. But for some people, these and other exasperating behaviors are uncontrollable, persistently plaguing their day-to-day existence and interfering with their ability to form lasting friendships or succeed in school, at home and with a career.
<br /><br />Unlike a broken bone or cancer, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, also known as just plain attention deficit disorder or ADD) does not show physical signs that can be detected by a blood or other lab test. The typical ADHD symptoms often overlap with those of other physical and psychological disorders.
<br /><br />The causes remain unknown, but ADHD can be diagnosed and effectively treated. Many resources are available to support families in managing ADHD behaviors when they occur.
<br /><br />ADHD, also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD) or hyperkinetic disorder, has been around a lot longer than most people realize. In fact, a condition that appears to be similar to ADHD was described by Hippocrates, who lived from 460 to 370 BC. The name Attention Deficit Disorder was first introduced in 1980 in DSM-III, the third edition of the 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,' used in psychiatry. In 1994 the definition was altered to include three groups within ADHD: the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type; the predominantly inattentive type; and the combined type. ADHD usually appears in childhood but can be diagnosed in adults.
<br /><br />Recent steps forward in our understanding of ADHD include:
<br /><br />An estimated 3 to 5 percent of children are affected — approximately 2 million children in the US. In a classroom of 25 to 30 children, it is likely that at least one will have ADHD.
<br /><br />ADHD is among the most common mental disorders among children. It is one of the top reasons for referral to a pediatrician, family physician, pediatric neurologist, child psychiatrist or psychologist. ADHD is best diagnosed by a child psychologist or other child specialist in ADHD.
<br /><br />ADHD is about three times more common among boys than girls.
<br /><br />The symptoms of ADHD do not always go away — up to 60 percent of child patients retain their symptoms into adulthood. Many adults with ADHD have never been diagnosed, so may not be aware they have the disorder. They may have been wrongly diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or a learning disability. 
<br />ADHD has been identified in every nation and culture that has been studied 
<br />ADHD is difficult for everyone involved to deal with. As well as the difficulty of living with the symptoms, wider society may face challenges. Some experts have linked ADHD with an increased risk of accidents, drug abuse, failure at school, antisocial behavior and criminal activity. But others view ADHD in a positive light, arguing that it is simply a different method of learning involving greater risk-taking and creativity.
<br /><br />ADHD is often accompanied by:
<br /><br />anxiety 
<br />learning disabilities 
<br />speech or hearing problems 
<br />obsessive-compulsive disorder 
<br />tics 
<br />behavioral problems such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) 
<br />Exactly what causes ADHD has not been pinpointed, though many practitioners believe neurobiological or genetic elements play a role. In addition, numerous social factors such as family conflict or poor child-rearing practices, while not causing the condition, may complicate the course of ADHD and its treatment.

There are simply too many variables in predicting the future, such that if you do get it right, it’s largely a matter of luck. But like all authors, I do secretly harbor this fantasy about the world turning out exactly like I predicted it, and my books being hailed as visionary tomes before their time, and my grave becoming a tourist spot for centuries where young kids with beards hang out writing romantic poetry late at night.
<br /><br />So it’s comforting to see that the visionary Ray Kurzweil (whose The Age of Spiritual Machines I heartily recommend) has, in effect, completely endorsed my idea of multi technology. Here’s what he says in an interview with GOOD Magazine:
<br /><br />By the late 2020s, nanobots in our brain (that will get there noninvasively, through the capillaries) will create full-immersion virtual-reality environments from within the nervous system. So if you want to go into virtual reality the nanobots shut down the signals coming from your real senses and replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were actually in the virtual environment. So this will provide full-immersion virtual reality incorporating all of the senses. You will have a body in these virtual-reality environments that you can control just like your real body, but it does not need to be the same body that you have in real reality. We’ll be able to interact with people in any way in these virtual-reality environments. That will replace most travel, but we’ll also have new travel technologies for our real bodies using nanotechnology.
<br /><br />Contrast that with how I describe the multi network in the appendices for Infoquake:
<br /><br />A multi projection is a virtual body that “exists” in real space. While the multied body is only an illusion created by neural manipulation, it can interact with real (”meat”) bodies in a way almost indistinguishable from physical human interaction…. The multi network depends on two key components: (1) the trillions of microscopic bots that process and relay sensory information to the network, and (2) neural OCHREs that manipulate the mind into “seeing” the sights, “hearing” the sounds, and “feeling” the sensations of the network. Similarly, those who interact with multi projections allow neural manipulation to trick the mind into believing the virtual bodies are present.
<br /><br />The big difference between good ol’ Ray and me is that a) he actually knows what he’s talking about, and <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/4210//smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> I didn’t figure we’d get this working for another few hundred years. Kurzweil thinks we’ll be sending multi projections around the globe about the same time that Malia Obama gets her Masters degree. I think many of Kurzweil’s predictions are a tad on the optimistic side — he thinks the singularity will happen, oh, any day now — but basically sound.

		<document id="86e8d8d1e9266bd6bdd8d7eb0a40216" url=""><![CDATA[The Physical Side of Stress<br/><br/>Although female&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo shoes&lt;/a&gt; sex hormones and brain chemistry offer some protection from stress, women are more deeply affected by the physical and emotional effects of stress than men. 
<br /><br />Women’s reactions to stress are rooted in their body chemistry. Men have higher androgen levels, while women have higher estrogen levels, says Paul J. Rosch, MD, FACP, president of the American Institute of Stress (AIS). “Their brains are also wired differently,” says Dr. Rosch, who&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo&lt;/a&gt; is also a clinical professor of medicine and psychiatry at New York Medical College, and honorary vice president of the International Stress Management Association. “Women tend to react to stress differently than men. They don’t respond with the fight or flight response — they’re more apt to negotiate.” 
<br /><br />Stress: How Women Are Affected 
<br />The effects of the anti-stress hormone oxytocin, produced during childbirth, breastfeeding, and in both sexes during orgasm, are enhanced by estrogen and reduced by testosterone, which helps women more than men, Rosch says. And nurturing activities boost oxytocin levels in women. The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo shoes&lt;/a&gt;catch-22 is that women need more oxytocin than men to maintain their emotional health. For example, Rosch explains, women are more negatively affected when they’re not touched, and also feel more stress than men in relationships. 
<br /><br />According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), stress is an expression of the body’s natural instinct to protect itself. While&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo&lt;/a&gt; this may warn a woman of immediate danger, like a fast-approaching car, prolonged stress effects can negatively affect your physical and emotional health. 
<br /><br />“Our stress response was exquisitely honed over millions of years as a protective mechanism,” said Rosch. “That was OK for our ancestors&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt; who ran into saber-toothed tigers. The tragedy is that today, it’s not that, but hundreds of things like getting stuck in traffic jams. Our bodies respond in the same unfortunate fashion, with hypertension, strokes, and ulcers.” 
<br /><br />Stress Effects: The Physical Side 
<br />“Your stress may vary, but if you have stress with your work, your kids, your neighbors, and marriage all at once, that’s a big deal,” said Lori &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;Heim, MD, president-elect of the AAFP and a hospitalist (a family physician who works only in a hospital) at Scotland Memorial Hospital in Laurinburg, N.C. “In women, I see this in changes in menstrual patterns — nothing else is going on except a huge increase in stress, and all of a sudden, they may be losing their hair or having menstrual irregularities, and everything points to stress as a factor.”
<br /><br />The AIS reports that some surveys show 75 to 90 percent of visits to primary care physicians are for stress-related complaints. According to the National Women’s Health Information Center, the effects of stress on women’s physical and emotional health can range from headaches to irritable bowel syndrome. Specific stress effects include: 
<br />Eating disorders. Anorexia and bulimia are 10 times more common in women than in men, says Rosch, and this may have something to do with stress levels. Like depression, this illness has been linked to low levels of serotonin and is often treated with serotonin-boosting antidepressant drugs.
<br />Stomach ailments. Stress can make you reach for junk or comfort foods, or upset your stomach to the point that you feel like you can’t eat. Common stress-related stomach troubles include cramps, bloating, heartburn, and even irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Depending on how you respond, these can lead to weight loss or weight gain.
<br />Skin reactions. Stress can lead to breakouts and even itchy rashes and hives in some people.
<br />Emotional conditions. From being in a blue or irritable mood to more serious mental issues like depression, your emotional health suffers when there’s stress in your life. Women are better than men at hiding some emotions like anger and aggressiveness because the parts of their brains responsible for these emotions are larger than men's, but depression strikes women twice as often as men, says Rosch, adding, “The emotional effects of stress on women can range from postpartum depression after pregnancy to depression after menopause.”
<br />Sleep &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt; problems. Trouble falling or staying asleep is common in women affected by stress, and this is particularly counterproductive since a good night’s sleep can help ease stress.
<br />Concentration difficulty. Stress makes it hard to focus and be effective in your responsibilities at home or work, and that can compound your problems if your stress comes from your job to begin with.
<br />Heart disease. The stress of competing in today’s job market has increased women’s heart disease risk, Rosch says. Stress can negatively affect the entire cardiovascular system, and lead to high blood pressure, stroke, and heart attack.
<br />Lowered &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt; immune response. One of the more complicated physical reactions to stress is your body’s lessened ability to fight off disease, whether it’s a cold or a flare-up of a chronic condition.
<br />Cancer. Some studies have suggested a link between stress and the development of breast and ovarian cancer. In one study, researchers found that the risk of breast cancer was increased by 62 percent in women who had experienced more than one highly stressful life event, like divorce or the death of a spouse. 
<br />Stress Effects: Stress-Lowering Techniques 
<br />Rosch points out that working women who are also raising families are smoking and drinking more than ever before — these aren’t healthy ways to deal with stress. He suggests the following three tips to help reduce the effects of stress: 
<br />Improve your diet. By eating well-balanced meals and skipping junk food, you can improve your physical well-being and, in turn, your emotional health.
<br />Make time for exercise. “We do know that exercise is a phenomenal way of dealing with stress and depression,” said Dr. Heim. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin&lt;/a&gt;
<br />Research shows that getting active can lift your spirits and increase the release of endorphins, a natural chemical associated with mood.
<br />Find fun ways to relax. Connect with family and friends and people you enjoy being around. Rediscover favorite hobbies; recent studies link a resurgence in knitting and needlepoint to their stress-reducing effects. Other popular stress-busters include yoga,&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin&lt;/a&gt;
<br /> meditation, and tai chi. 
<br />Finally, if you feel overwhelmed by stress and its effects, talk to your doctor about ways to deal with it. You may learn new techniques for managing stress on your own, or you may find that therapy with a mental health professional will better help you to get it all under control.

(AP)—Kenechi Udeze’s(notes) comeback from leukemia served as an inspiration to his Minnesota Vikings teammates.
<br /><br />The announcement of his retirement will not diminish that.
<br /><br />Udeze retired on Thursday, saying his leukemia is still in remission but the side effects from&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt; the treatments for the disease were making it too difficult to continue the rigors of life in the NFL.
<br /><br />“I would like to thank the Wilf family and the Minnesota Vikings organization for their support,” Udeze said in a prepared statement. “I would also like to thank my fans, friends and family for supporting me through everything. Last but not least, I would like to thank all of the medical professionals and staff in Minnesota who worked tirelessly to give me a second chance at life. God bless.”
<br /><br />Minnesota’&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;s first-round draft pick in 2004, Udeze was a starter for four years and tied for the team lead with five sacks in 2007. In his career, Udeze played 51 games, with 11 sacks and 117 total tackles.
<br /><br />“He hates to let it go and I hate for him to let it go,” coach Brad Childress said. “But it’s really best for him.”
<br /><br />That he made it this close to training camp—the Vikings hold their first practice on Friday—is a remarkable achievement.
<br /><br />He was diagnosed in February 2008 with the disease, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Udeze missed all of last season while dealing with his condition and the Vikings, in a classy move, paid him while he was in recovery.
<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENT
<br /><br />After a marrow transplant from his brother more than a year ago, Udeze started working out on the campus of his alma mater USC in hopes of making a comeback.
<br /><br />“I’d be lying if I said it was easy,” Udeze said in May. “There was never an easy point. The first time I went back to USC and started working out with the fellas, I fell. I took two steps and I fell.”
<br /><br />Eventually he worked his way back into good enough condition to make a go of it at the minicamps. He showed up at the team’s facilities looking much like the player he was before he became sick. With a big smile and a chiseled physique, Udeze took 26 snaps during the weekend and spoke of what it meant for him to be back on the field after having been through so much.
<br /><br />The entire team rallied around the popular defensive end who had been through so much. Udeze participated throughout the minicamp, but struggled with neuropathy in his feet, a side effect of chemotherapy.
<br /><br />“When it sets in, your feet start getting really numb and really sensitive, and it’s really hard to (move), especially at the level that we’re at out here,” Udeze said then.
<br /><br />Childress said that was eventually what kept Udeze from coming to training camp. The numbness prevented Udeze from being able to plant firmly and create any burst up the field after the snap.
<br /><br />“He did all that stuff to put himself in a position, but his feet kind of have betrayed him, and everything goes through the feet,” Childress said Thursday. “He had no way of knowing until he went out there and posted on it and tried.”
<br /><br />It took quite some time for Udeze to come to terms with the fact that he had played his last snap. Over the past several weeks he has spoken with teammates and coaches while contemplating retirement, a tough pill to swallow for a proud 26-year-old whose optimistic view of leukemia as “nothing worse than the common cold” helped get him through.
<br /><br />“He’s so worried about being a quitter,” Childress said. “And just the thing that he’s overcome already in his young life to be alive and thriving, (it) took him a while to come to grips with that.”
<br /><br />But Childress said this is not the end, for Udeze, but the beginning. He took some classes at USC while rehabilitating and expects to still be around the Vikings in the future.
<br /><br />“He’s alive and living and thriving,” Childress said. “Just wish him well and he’s not going to be a stranger.”

<br /><br />The drug, which terminates pregnancy by causing the embryo to detach from the uterine wall, is already available in several other European countries. But approval in Italy had been held up so far by the Catholic Church, which opposes abortion and contraception.
<br /><br />The Italian Drug Agency ruled after a meeting that ended late Thursday that the drug cannot be sold in drug stores but can only be administered by doctors in a hospital.
<br /><br />The agency said in a statement that the pill can only be taken up to the seventh week of pregnancy, and not up to the ninth as is the case in other countries. It also said that women who had used the pill between the seventh and the ninth week of pregnancy incurred more risks and&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;  had often needed surgery.
<br /><br />In a nod to the ethical implications associated with the decision and the controversy surrounding it, the agency noted that &quot;the task of protecting the well-being of citizens ... must take precedence over personal convictions.&quot; The vote at the agency's executive branch was 4-1, according to news reports.
<br /><br />The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;Vatican, which has battled in the United Nations and other forums to halt acceptance of the abortion pill, was quick to attack.
<br /><br />Archbishop Rino Fisichella, who heads the Vatican's Pontifical Academy for Life, said in an interview published Friday that while the RU-486 was perhaps less traumatic for women, taking it was still abortion.
<br /><br />&quot;Suppression of an embryo is de facto the suppression of human life, which has dignity and value from conception to the end,&quot; Fisichella told Corriere della Sera, using a Vatican catch phrase to signal its opposition to abortion and euthanasia.
<br /><br />Elio &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%2FJimmy_Choo_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BJimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com/Jimmy_Choo_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Jimmy</a> Choo Sandals&lt;/a&gt;Sgreccia, another top official from the Academy for Life, said that women taking the pill or doctors administering it incur automatic excommunication under church law.
<br /><br />Supporters of the pill say the RU-486 offers an additional option in a country where abortion is already legal.
<br /><br />Women who want an abortion &quot;can now choose to use a pharmacological method that is less invasive than surgical intervention,&quot; said Silvana Maura, a lawmaker with the opposition party Italy of Values.
<br /><br />Abortion on demand through the end of the third month of pregnancy was legalized in Italy in 1978. Three years later, Italians voted in a referendum to keep the law, defying a campaign from the Vatican. Abortion after three months is allowed when the pregnancy is deemed a grave danger to the woman's mental or physical health.
<br /><br />Since the year 2000, Italy also allows the morning-after pill, which prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall so it can grow into an embryo.

<br /><br />Everyone has a preferred flavor enhancer for a &quot;mean&quot; tuna salad—celery, apples, relish, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;olives...the list goes on. But the key ingredient has got to be the tuna itself: Not even a whole jar of mayonnaise can salvage a smelly, soggy can of fish…
<br /><br />Canned &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt; tuna meat should be firm and flaky, but never mushy. It should be moist but not watery (and certainly not dry). And it has to look appetizing before it's dressed up with seductive ingredients.
<br /><br />It was not easy deciding which tunas to feature in our taste test. They come in cans, glass jars, and even pouches, and can be packed in water, vegetable oil, or olive oil. Even more confusing: Tuna varieties sold in cans include albacore, yellowfin, skipjack, and tongol. &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;After much research, we chose to focus our test on canned chunk light skipjack and tongol in both water and oil. Why? Light meat, ie: chunk light tuna (in oil and water) accounts for 75 to 80 percent of annual domestic canned tuna consumption in the U.S., according to The Tuna Council.
<br /><br />There is a health issue too: Chunk light skipjack and tongol generally have lower levels of mercury than albacore and yellowfin (for more information, read Mercury in Canned Tuna and the Seafood Selector entry on canned tuna from the Environmental Defense Fund).
<br /><br />To &quot;catch&quot; the best chunk light canned tuna, we tasted 12 varieties available nationwide, including the following, listed from highest to lowest score in our tests: 365 Everyday Value Chunk Light Tongol Tuna Packed in Spring Water, Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna in Oil, Trader Joe's Tongol Chunk Light in Water, Starkist Gourmet Choice Solid Light Tuna Fillet in Olive Oil*, Wild Planet Wild Skip Jack Light Tuna (no water)*, Miramonte Tongol Tuna in Spring Water**, Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna in Water**, Bumble Bee Chunk Light Tuna in Water, Cento Solid Pack Light Tuna, Starkist Chunk Light Tuna in Vegetable Oil, Chicken of the Sea Chunk Light Tuna in Oil, and Progresso Solid Light Tuna in Olive Oil.

Kelly-penned &quot;I Look To You,&quot; as a free download on her official website. The title track of her much-anticipated first album since 2002, which finally comes out September 1, is a stripped-down piano ballad that showcases Whitney's world-famous voice, and it is being heralded as a true return to form for the once-troubled diva.
<br /><br />&quot;I &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; Look To You&quot; was previewed last week by Sony honcho/longtime Whitney mentor Clive Davis at a star-studded Beverly Hilton Hotel listening party (attended by the likes of Jane Fonda, Barry Manilow, Halle Berry, Stevie Wonder, and Magic Johnson), along with eight other well-received songs that indicated that the fallen queen of R&amp;B/pop might finally be ready reclaim her throne. 
<br /><br />&quot;I &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;know that if I did not have faith, I would have not been able to go through life's tribulations that I have gone through,&quot; Whitney declared at the bash via a statement read by Clive, who has been working with Whitney on I Look To You for the past three-and-a-half years. And now the full album's unveiling is only six weeks away! Welcome back, Whitney.
<br /><br />Another&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt; diva who's no stranger to comebacks--Mariah Carey, who rebounded from her Glitter career disaster and emotional breakdown with The Emancipation Of Mimi in 2005, and has stayed on top ever since--made news this week regarding her own upcoming new album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. But it seems fans will have to wait a little bit longer for that release. Memoirs was originally slated for an August 25 street date, but it has now been delayed until September 15 so that Mariah can put the finishing touches on the project. (Lil' Wayne, Diddy, and Amerie also announced this week that they're all postponing their respective albums, so this seems like a puzzling music-biz trend here.) 
<br /><br />Perhaps the more interesting Mimi-centric headline this week had to do with the ongoing Mariah/Eminem feud. The two superstars reportedly briefly dated years ago, before Mariah married Nick Cannon (although Mariah denies this), and Eminem recently released a Mariah diss track about their alleged relationship, &quot;Bagpipes From Baghdad,&quot; that had Nick fuming on his personal blog. Mariah retaliated with her new single &quot;Obsessed,&quot; which asked the musical question, &quot;Why're you so obsessed with me?&quot; and was accompanied by a hilarious video starring Mariah as a stalker Shady lookalike who gets run over by a bus.

They give us the ability to take what would otherwise be a flat page of text and images and start sending information to the person or people behind the webpage. It’s then that the page becomes a tool rather than just a reference. WebSite Tonight has &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; always offered forms available in all sorts of customizable shapes and formats to make your site more dynamic and useful, but what happens when your site attracts the attention of less than scrupulous characters? Wait a minute… is THAT where all that spam is coming from via my website’s form?
<br /><br />As a long time user of WebSite Tonight (and someone who hates spam as much as you) I am glad &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt; to present our new CAPTCHA feature to the Website Tonight forms. As a bit of background, CAPTCHA is an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” and you can see them anywhere from your MySpace login to Go Daddy’s password reset. CAPTCHA’S are usually an image of a series of characters or a word, hidden inside of a background of squiggles or slashes that prevent image recognition software from reading it. The form user is requested to type in the characters as they see them and if they’re correct, the form is submitted.
<br /><br />WebSite Tonight’s CAPTCHA features dynamically generates images using randomly created &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;number patterns, which means that no matter how many times a spambot may try to pick up a pattern and get around the form protection, they’ll never find it as there is no set list. Every new CAPTCHA is a new pattern specifically made to be easily readable for your human users and difficult for anything else.
<br /><br />This feature is available for all Deluxe and Premium users as of right now, and if you’re already familiar with the WebSite Tonight form editor, you’ll be pleased to find out that you can add it and move it around in exactly the same fashion you would with any other form field. Republish your project and there you are, spam-free living. 
<br /><br />If it’s online, and you want to keep the bots out, there are few ways better than CAPTCHA to do so. We have been looking forward to offering this feature for a while and look forward to your feedback on it. As always, let us know what you think!

<br /><br />Poets&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;  and friends packed into the cozy basement venue and even converted a few unsuspecting coffee sippers into audience members. But how could they not stay: JAZ’s poems and songs triumphed over the upstairs sound system — particularly her goose-bump inducing rendition of Sarah McLachlan’s “Possession.” And although, I must admit I would happily listen to Ashraf Osman, in his sultry Lebanese accent, read passages from a VCR manual, it was the unexpected metaphors peppered throughout his poems that stunned me over and over again. You should read them; they will rip the hair off your head!

It’s free, but you can also make a donation to Lincolnshire Wolds Railway while you’re on Pete’s site.
<br /><br />Incidentally, remember when this blog used to have content other than gig posters on it. I’ll try and make more of an effort in future. Sorry.
<br /><br />So here’s the third in the recent Autumn Store batch of three. Sticking to the aquatic theme, it’s a sea turtle! This is also our pre-Indietracks gig (and you can see all of the pre-Indietracks gigs in other cities on the Indietracks Website)/

<br /><br />shoes.com/Jimmy_Choo_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Jimmy Choo Sandals&lt;/a&gt; idly browsing 
<br /><br />JetPens recently I happened across some Copic Drawing Pens. That Copic 
<br /><br />makes drawing pens is hardly news; I’ve been using their markers and 
<br /><br />Multiliners both refillable and disposable for awhile. What was 
<br /><br />interesting about these Drawing Pens was that they were…fountain pens. I 
<br /><br />beseeched the folks at JetPens to provide me with samples for review, and 
<br /><br />they were kind enough to oblige.
<br /><br />The&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt; pens are 
<br /><br />not refillable. The nibs are unmarked, appear to be made of steel, and 
<br /><br />are reasonably smooth. Unsurprisingly, I found the F02 nib to be a bit 
<br /><br />smoother than the F01s. Both are firm approaching state of nail – they 
<br /><br />appeared to yield to some amount of pressure, but did not yield any 
<br /><br />significant line variation in use. They put down a decent wet line with 
<br /><br />good flow, though the F01s wrote a bit dry when I first uncapped them and 
<br /><br />needed a gentle shake or two. (Incidentally, the barrel of the pen 
<br /><br />advises you to not “shake hard and drop,” as “ink may leak.” Thanks.)
<br /><br />I&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-</a>
<br /><br />shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;  
<br /><br />sometimes draw a bit and have also been known to put a splash of 
<br /><br />watercolor on those drawings when “finished.” The Multiliners are great 
<br /><br />for ink and wash drawings, completely waterproof. Well, the barrels of 
<br /><br />the Drawing Pens say “Copic-proof” (how recursive,) but, ominously, NOT 
<br /><br />“waterproof.”
<br /><br />Below&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-</a>
<br /><br />shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;  
<br /><br />are the results of dragging a Niji waterbrush across some doodles. This 
<br /><br />was done maybe 20 minutes after the “drawings” were finished.
<br /><br />As&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-</a>
<br /><br />shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;  
<br /><br />you can see, smearing (along with its old friend beading – these were 
<br /><br />done in that hipster paragon the Moleskine sketchbook) occurred. If you’
<br /><br />re buying these to use with Copic markers, you’re, well, Copic-cetic. If 
<br /><br />not, expect smearing and tears (yours, not the pens, which as we all know 
<br /><br />are inanimate objects incapable of tears.) I’m somewhat confused as to 
<br /><br />why Copic introduced these, as they already produce a pretty extensive 
<br /><br />line of drawing pens and markers. My only surmise is that these are meant 
<br /><br />to compete with the Tachikawa line of disposable Manga pens. These are a 
<br /><br />reasonably decent, inexpensive fountain pen, and probably a step up from 
<br /><br />a Preppy or a Varsity.

<br /><br />The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt; creature, dubbed the bare-faced bulbul, was found in Laos, and is the only known bald songbird in mainland Asia. 
<br /><br />It's also the first time in over 100 years that a new Asian species of bulbul bird has been uncovered. 
<br /><br />&quot;To find &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt; a new bird species is very rare these days,&quot; said Peter Clyne, assistant director for Asia Programs at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. &quot;It's not like we're finding new species of birds every year. This is certainly a highly newsworthy event.&quot; 
<br /><br />The chrome-domed songbird was discovered by Wildlife Conservation Society scientists Will Duckworth and Rob Timmins and Iain Woxvold of the University of Melbourne as part of a project funded by a mining company, Minerals and Metals Group, that operates in the region. 
<br /><br />The&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt;  bare-faced bulbul lives in the sparse trees and sun-bleached karst limestone of the Laos lowlands. 
<br /><br />&quot;Its apparent restriction to rather inhospitable habitat helps to explain why such an extraordinary bird with conspicuous habits and a distinctive call has remained unnoticed for so long,&quot; Woxvold said. 
<br /><br />About&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin shoes&lt;/a&gt;  the size of a thrush, the new bird has olive green feathers on its back and a light-colored breast. Its large dark eyes dominate its bald pink face. 
<br /><br />&quot;Whenever you come across a bird that's bald, it's a prominent characteristic,&quot; Clyne told LiveScience. &quot;Usually, but not always, it's thought to play some kind of a role in communication between the sexes.&quot; 
<br /><br />The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;researchers describe the bird's call as a &quot;series of whistled, dry bubbling notes.&quot; 
<br /><br />More famous examples of bald-headed birds are turkeys and bald eagles, though the species are not related to the new bulbul. There are about 130 species total in the bulbul family. 
<br /><br />The &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;researchers describe the new species, whose official name is Passeriformes Pycnonotidae, in the latest issue of the Oriental Bird Club's scientific journal Forktail.

(AP)—Kenechi Udeze’s(notes) comeback from leukemia served as an inspiration to his Minnesota Vikings teammates.
<br /><br />The announcement of his retirement will not diminish that.
<br /><br />Udeze retired on Thursday, saying his leukemia is still in remission but the side effects from&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt; the treatments for the disease were making it too difficult to continue the rigors of life in the NFL.
<br /><br />“I would like to thank the Wilf family and the Minnesota Vikings organization for their support,” Udeze said in a prepared statement. “I would also like to thank my fans, friends and family for supporting me through everything. Last but not least, I would like to thank all of the medical professionals and staff in Minnesota who worked tirelessly to give me a second chance at life. God bless.”
<br /><br />Minnesota’&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;s first-round draft pick in 2004, Udeze was a starter for four years and tied for the team lead with five sacks in 2007. In his career, Udeze played 51 games, with 11 sacks and 117 total tackles.
<br /><br />“He hates to let it go and I hate for him to let it go,” coach Brad Childress said. “But it’s really best for him.”
<br /><br />That he made it this close to training camp—the Vikings hold their first practice on Friday—is a remarkable achievement.
<br /><br />He was diagnosed in February 2008 with the disease, which is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Udeze missed all of last season while dealing with his condition and the Vikings, in a classy move, paid him while he was in recovery.
<br /><br />ADVERTISEMENT
<br /><br />After a marrow transplant from his brother more than a year ago, Udeze started working out on the campus of his alma mater USC in hopes of making a comeback.
<br /><br />“I’d be lying if I said it was easy,” Udeze said in May. “There was never an easy point. The first time I went back to USC and started working out with the fellas, I fell. I took two steps and I fell.”
<br /><br />Eventually he worked his way back into good enough condition to make a go of it at the minicamps. He showed up at the team’s facilities looking much like the player he was before he became sick. With a big smile and a chiseled physique, Udeze took 26 snaps during the weekend and spoke of what it meant for him to be back on the field after having been through so much.
<br /><br />The entire team rallied around the popular defensive end who had been through so much. Udeze participated throughout the minicamp, but struggled with neuropathy in his feet, a side effect of chemotherapy.
<br /><br />“When it sets in, your feet start getting really numb and really sensitive, and it’s really hard to (move), especially at the level that we’re at out here,” Udeze said then.
<br /><br />Childress said that was eventually what kept Udeze from coming to training camp. The numbness prevented Udeze from being able to plant firmly and create any burst up the field after the snap.
<br /><br />“He did all that stuff to put himself in a position, but his feet kind of have betrayed him, and everything goes through the feet,” Childress said Thursday. “He had no way of knowing until he went out there and posted on it and tried.”
<br /><br />It took quite some time for Udeze to come to terms with the fact that he had played his last snap. Over the past several weeks he has spoken with teammates and coaches while contemplating retirement, a tough pill to swallow for a proud 26-year-old whose optimistic view of leukemia as “nothing worse than the common cold” helped get him through.
<br /><br />“He’s so worried about being a quitter,” Childress said. “And just the thing that he’s overcome already in his young life to be alive and thriving, (it) took him a while to come to grips with that.”
<br /><br />But Childress said this is not the end, for Udeze, but the beginning. He took some classes at USC while rehabilitating and expects to still be around the Vikings in the future.
<br /><br />“He’s alive and living and thriving,” Childress said. “Just wish him well and he’s not going to be a stranger.”

<br /><br />A government-commissioned report recommended that organs donated within the state-run National Health Service should stay within the public health system.
<br /><br />Very few Britons have private transplants, so in practice the new rules will stop overseas patients from coming to Britain and paying privately for a transplant.
<br /><br />The&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%2FJimmy_Choo_Sandals.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BJimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com/Jimmy_Choo_Sandals.html&quot;&gt;Jimmy</a> Choo Sandals&lt;/a&gt; report by Elisabeth Buggins, former head of the Organ Donation Taskforce, was commissioned after a media storm over cases in which foreign patients were given transplants from dead Britons.
<br /><br />Buggins said that for most people, &quot;financial gain from the transplant of donated organs feels morally wrong.&quot;
<br /><br />She&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt;  said most people who wanted to donate their organs assumed they would be given to people on an NHS waiting list, and the idea of &quot;queue-jumpers&quot; could deter donors.
<br /><br />&quot;While I found no evidence of wrongdoing in the way organs are allocated to patients, there is &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;a perception that private payments may unfairly influence access to transplant, so they must be banned,&quot; Buggins said.
<br /><br />Citizens of other European Union countries will still be entitled to publicly funded transplants in some circumstances, but the report said these should be tightened and clarified.
<br /><br />The ban does not affect transplants from living donors — such as kidney transplants — which can still be carried out privately as long as no money changes hands.
<br /><br />The report also said there should be greater transparency in the way organs are allocated.
<br /><br />The government said it accepted the recommendations and hoped to enact the ban by October.
<br /><br />There are currently about 8,000 people waiting for organ transplants in Britain. In the past year, about 3,500 patients received transplants but another 1,000 on the waiting list died.

<br /><br />Even&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; as signs grow that banks are steadying up and the housing market may be stabilizing, unemployment data show just how hard the recession has hit America's manufacturing centers.
<br /><br />Nationwide,&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt;  unemployment has jumped to 9.5% from 5.7% a year ago. But for cities focused on manufacturing, it's been worse. The 10 cities where the unemployment rate has risen the most in the past year, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, are all major manufacturing centers, many with ties to the automobile industry.
<br /><br />At the top of the list are Indiana's Kokomo and the Elkhart-Goshen metro area. Both cities &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;have sustained double-digit percentage increases in unemployment as factories have shut down, and businesses that depend on those factories have suffered. Some 20% of the jobs in Kokomo were once at Chrysler and Delphi plants, and Elkhart-Goshen was home to recreational vehicle manufacturers whose sales have collapsed amid the recession.
<br /><br />Unemployment has risen dramatically in four Michigan cities--Monroe, Muskegon, Detroit, and Flint--as the auto industry has downsized. Michigan's 15.2% unemployment rate is the highest of any state, and Detroit's 17.1% rate is the highest of any metro area with more than 500,000 people.

<br /><br />Rupp &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; has farmed his whole life. He lives in Goshen County, a rural spot along the Nebraska line where cattle outnumber humans 16 to 1 and you can still see the ruts cut by wagons that hauled pioneers along the Oregon Trail. &quot;We're very conservative,&quot; said Rupp, 62. &quot;We don't go out too far on a limb.&quot;
<br /><br />That&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt; prudent financial bent, matched with the high prices paid for crops and energy in the past few years, has largely protected Goshen County and a core group of several hundred other counties in 10 states from the recession's chokehold. The Associated Press Economic Stress Index shows they make up a &quot;safe zone&quot; that covers a long swath of middle America, from the Great Plains south to Texas.
<br /><br />But &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;the safe zone is shrinking. Energy production and prices are sliding, especially for coal and natural gas. Crop prices are dropping, too, as there's less demand in Asia for American wheat, corn and soybeans. There were 800 counties in the safe zone a year ago, a number that dropped to about 300 counties in May and slid further to 200 counties in June.
<br /><br />&quot;To say that you're doing pretty well is just to say that it's the best-looking puppy in a pretty ugly litter,&quot; said Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who recently imposed a 10 percent budget cut across his state's government in response to falling tax revenue from the energy sector.
<br /><br />The contiguous counties in the safe zone start in Montana and North Dakota, and cascade into Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma, and end in northern Texas and ee safe zone had an AP Economic Stress score under 5 in June, making them the economically healthiest in the United States.
<br /><br />The AP calculates a score from 1 to 100 based on each county's unemployment, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates. The higher the score, the higher the economic stress.

It’s then that the page becomes a tool rather than just a reference. WebSite Tonight has &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; always offered forms available in all sorts of customizable shapes and formats to make your site more dynamic and useful, but what happens when your site attracts the attention of less than scrupulous characters? Wait a minute… is THAT where all that spam is coming from via my website’s form?
<br /><br />As a long time user of WebSite Tonight (and someone who hates spam as much as you) I am glad &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Loutoutin_Boots.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Loutoutin_Boots.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Loutoutin Boots&lt;/a&gt; to present our new CAPTCHA feature to the Website Tonight forms. As a bit of background, CAPTCHA is an acronym for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart” and you can see them anywhere from your MySpace login to Go Daddy’s password reset. CAPTCHA’S are usually an image of a series of characters or a word, hidden inside of a background of squiggles or slashes that prevent image recognition software from reading it. The form user is requested to type in the characters as they see them and if they’re correct, the form is submitted.
<br /><br />WebSite Tonight’s CAPTCHA features dynamically generates images using randomly created &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo sale&lt;/a&gt;number patterns, which means that no matter how many times a spambot may try to pick up a pattern and get around the form protection, they’ll never find it as there is no set list. Every new CAPTCHA is a new pattern specifically made to be easily readable for your human users and difficult for anything else.
<br /><br />This feature is available for all Deluxe and Premium users as of right now, and if you’re already familiar with the WebSite Tonight form editor, you’ll be pleased to find out that you can add it and move it around in exactly the same fashion you would with any other form field. Republish your project and there you are, spam-free living. 
<br /><br />If it’s online, and you want to keep the bots out, there are few ways better than CAPTCHA to do so. We have been looking forward to offering this feature for a while and look forward to your feedback on it. As always, let us know what you think!

It is said that copying is the sincerest form of flattery, so when I did my daily read of the tech blogs this morning I was of course interested to read on Techcrunch that retweet.com will soon be entering the fray and that it looked suspiciously like TweetMeme.
<br /><br />I had actually been &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2Fchristian_louboutin_pumps.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bchristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/christian_louboutin_pumps.html&quot;&gt;christian</a> louboutin pumps&lt;/a&gt; contacted by their COO Tyson Quick in April to ask if we would support their plan to get twitter to support retweeting natively on Twitter. At the time I responded that I would think about it, in fact what I thought was that they were obviously trying to get us to help them promote a service that would at a later stage turn into a competitor, so I ignored it.
<br /><br />What caught my attention was that some industrious individual (@travisketchum) had left a comment on the TechCrunch article that he had been doing some digging around on the website and had found &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc%2FChristian_Louboutin_Wedges.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BChristian"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian-louboutin-shoes.cc/Christian_Louboutin_Wedges.html&quot;&gt;Christian</a> Louboutin Wedges&lt;/a&gt;a link to their development environment. What we found ourselves was that our retweet button Javascript and the Wordpress plugin code seemed to have been directly copied from ours.
<br /><br />We are happy for others to learn from our endeavors and flattered by the copying but some of our more complex JavaScript was obfuscated to deter others from attempting to re-use our code. We take a &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimmy-choo-shoes.com%26quot%3B%26gt%3Bjimmy"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmy-choo-shoes.com&quot;&gt;jimmy</a> choo shoes&lt;/a&gt;dim view of trying to pass off our code especially when it is attempting to create a competitor.
<br /><br />We our seeking further legal advice and will be pursuing every avenue to protect the hard work of our team.
