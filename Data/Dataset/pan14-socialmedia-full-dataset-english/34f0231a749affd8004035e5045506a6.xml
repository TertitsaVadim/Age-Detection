The reason for this is you have uninstalled it partially, the files of this program are corrupted, or the program itself has revised its uninstalling program into an installing program, so you wonder, is there any way you can remove Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy without going through the common way of doing it? Yes you also can force uninstall the unwanted Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy with the right method.
<br /><br />Why you cannot remove a tough program thru Add/Remove programs?
<br /><br />For this we need to trace back to the process of the installation of this program.
<br />First of all, when installing a program, its files are often put into the specified location: some files are copied into the Program Files Folder, and other files like shared libraries (.dll files) are copied into Common Files which is inside the Program Files, at the same time, some other shared libraries or drivers are copied and located into the ‘WINDOWSSystem32' and ‘WINDOWSSystem32drivers' folders.
<br /><br />After that there are also some changes in the Windows registry: some registry entries may be changed, so their traces may also be changed. Then a new registry key is put into the Windows Registry from where the Window Add/Remove tool can search programs that have installed in this computer.
<br /><br />When a user tries to force uninstall Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy through the Add/Remove tool, this uninstaller often cannot find out and completely delete all the files, registry entries and traces related to Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy, so as to make this program corrupted or leave parts of this program still in his machine. We often see this also happen when uninstalling some tough but powerful software like Norton, Adobe products, and Kaspersky etc.
<br /><br />The Best Way to Force Uninstall:
<br /><br />If you know exactly how the Windows Registry works and how you can remove all files related to this program, you can try a manual force removal yourself. But before this removal, I would like to remind you that if some mistakes happen during this process, it will bring severe damages to the windows registry and your computer. So even you are an advanced PC user, you’d better try another easier and better way to force uninstall Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy.
<br /><br />Among so many similar auto-uninstall software, Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy remover definitely is the best one that allows you to force uninstall Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy in just a few clicks: it will help you remove Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy, and then it will scan your registry and drivers to see whether some files are still left, if there are, it will delete them all. Even the users with limited computer knowledge can use <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PUZwcm0xVkRjU2Fj" target="_blank">this uninstall tool</a> easily!
