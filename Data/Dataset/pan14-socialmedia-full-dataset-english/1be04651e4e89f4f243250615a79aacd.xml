Also, in the Elle interview session, the &quot;Fifty Shades of Blue&quot; actress shared plenty of interesting information about her famous boyfriend Justin Bieber, relationship with her mom, growing up Disney and her childhood idol.<br />At approximately the same time, rumors began circulating that Selena Gomez was pregnant. The rumors, mostly pushed by Twitter devotees, speculated or directly accused Justin of being the father.<br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fembed%2FDReGMYteUo0%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/embed/DReGMYteUo0&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />It's too bad that Selena couldn't just wave a wand like in her show and have Justin Bieber materialize, but this is one case where life cannot imitate art! With the amount of time that's gone by since the two have been together, Bieber could hop that flight and come east to Connecticut.<br />Let's have a look back this love triangle. Last year, Jasmine Villegas was said to be the GF of Justin, but after the exposure of Selena and Justin's intimate pictures, Selena became the real GF of Justin, many fans viewed them as a perfect couple, personally, I also think they should have a good result. I hope Justin is not the type of boys who fickle in affection love the new and loathe the old. The break up rumor was because that Justin was caught texting his ex.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnMv" target="_blank">Selena Gomez Hot</a>

At the tender age of seven she began appearing on &quot;Barney And Friends&quot; as Gianna. It was at the auditions for &quot;Barney And Friends&quot; that Selena Gomez met another tween pop star, &quot;Camp Rock&quot; sensation, Demi Lovato. The two have been the best of friends ever since and are happy for each other's success. She has also appeared in other Disney Channel vehicles including &quot;The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana.&quot; Selena Gomez has been such a great success for the Disney Channel, she will surely be cast in several more Disney productions in the years to come.<br />One Direction's Harry's penchant for cougar dating first hit the headlines when it was revealed he was seeing TV presenter Caroline Flack, 32 years old to his then 17 years young (he's now just 18). Since then he's had a physical relationship with 32 year old DJ Lucy Horobin (quite a scandal as she was married and her husband sold his story to the Sun newspaper, telling of his 'unimaginable pain') and was rumoured to be dating Caroline Sarler, aged 30.

She was pretty in pink in the lip-lock scene. &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; star Selena Gomez completed her look with bright white sneakers. Meanwhile, her 17-year-old co-star Nat Wolff dressed more casually. Nat wore a blue V-neck t-shirt and jeans, looking so handsome. The nice on-screen couple were adorable while filming romantic scenes together.<br />Last time Justin made his way to Selena Gomez was when she was in Florida the day her &quot;We Own the Night&quot; tour stopped there. He went about it very smoothly, he tweeted that he was in Canada and didn't give his fans any reason to think he would show up in Florida.<br />Is selena gomez ready for a change? On Friday, a large moving truck pulled up to the Disney star's California home. The ramp was dropped and cones were placed around it '&quot; hinting that it might be there for awhile. Paparazzi busily snapped photos, reports Hollywood Life.<br />The actresses' outfits were far different from the costumes they mostly wore in Spring Breakers, which could probably all be piled into one hatbox for transportation. They did their thieving roles in the skimpiest of bikinis, for scenes from frolics in the ocean to mug shots at the police station. Not typical for Selena Gomez. The film is about four girls who steal money to finance their spring break trip, and run afoul of a local drug lord.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.pictures.stylebistro.com%2Ffp%2FSelena%2BGomez%2BMakeup%2BSmoky%2BEyes%2BmuY1rCjStq-l.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www2.pictures.stylebistro.com/fp/Selena+Gomez+Makeup+Smoky+Eyes+muY1rCjStq-l.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />Selena and Miley also appeal to different tastes. Selena has more of the elegant classic beauty, but Miley has a versatile look that can go preppy, grungy, or provocative.<br />I feel so relieved now that I know you have read this, and you will not make those minor hiccups that past teen icons have made after they turned 18.

Of the episodes of attack, the topless photo is the only instance that seems to have no connection to Justin Bieber or his fans, although the timing of its posting is suspicious. Gomez's reps maintain that they are pursuing the matter.<br />Gomez, the star of Ramona and Beezus, has rescheduled her appearance at the 2010 Ohio State Fair under physician's orders.

Hordes of Selena Gomez fans will be heading for the site, to look for jobs as extras and stand-ins. Or, they might just stand around and watch.<br />Now that you are 18 years old, and one of the young rising pop icons in Hollywood, I feel it as my duty to give you some helpful advice for your journey through stardom. First, let me congratulate you for the great work you have put in through the years starting with being a kid on Barney &amp; Friends, then moving on to becoming Alex Russo on Disney's hit show Wizards on Waverly Place. Now you have graduated to the big screen and are blessing us with such roles as Beatrice &quot;Beezus&quot; Quimby in Ramona and Beezus and Grace in the upcoming movie Monte Carlo. Miss Gomez it will be my pleasure to help navigate you away from the many things that could alienate your career.<br />Famous Feud. Selena Gomez made headlines in 2008 for supposedly carrying on a feud with another Disney star, Miley Cyrus. The feud was allegedly initiated by Selena dating Nick Jonas, who was previously romantically linked with Miley Cyrus. Both stars vehemently denied the fighting and publicly proclaimed their utmost respect for each other. Whether true or not, fans must realize that these are very young girls who are essentially growing up in the public eye and are sure to stumble now and then before they reach adulthood.<br />Gomez expressed her satisfaction with the roles chosen in the past: &quot;I get offered the teenybopper movies, and I've done that,&quot; Gomez told Elle. Other extremely popular shows include: Hannah Montana starring Miley Cyrus, Wizards of Waverly starring Selena Gomez and David Henrie, The Cheetah Girls, High school Musical starring Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, Camp Rock starring Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers and more.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyaWdnc3Bob3RvLm5ldC9zZWxlbmEtZ29tZXotd2FsbHBhcGVycy8_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez Hot</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnMv" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnM_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>

Even so, because of Los Angeles' notorious traffic problems, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber were not together as &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; readied to premiere at the Grove on Saturday when Selena walked the red carpet solo.<br />Busy Future. In addition to filming a second season of &quot;Wizards Of Waverly Place,&quot; Selena Gomez is currently working on an album of dance songs and has developed her own production company, July Moon Productions. Selena is planning a national tour in support of her album to take place in 2009. This gifted young performer is making the most of her newfound popularity and God given talents. Fans will surely make any future projects of Selena Gomez a raving success.<br />On September 13, Justin Bieber sat down with Ryan Seacrest to talk about his dream date with Selena Gomez, the influence of Michael Jackson and his new book titled 'Just Getting Started.' The candid conversation aired on Thursday on 'Today' and gave fans a peek at what the future holds for Justin Bieber.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcelebritieshype.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F02%2FSelena-Gomez-Long-Hairstyles-.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://celebritieshype.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Selena-Gomez-Long-Hairstyles-.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />It is also announced on Tuesday that selena gomez will join a few other highly recognizable names including James Franco, Emma Roberts and Vanessa Hudgens in the upcoming movie &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;. According to some source, the film is about &quot;four college girls who rob a restaurant to pay for their trip to the beach&quot;. Selena's role will be a religious girl who isn't really much of a thrill seeker at all. Meanwhile James Franco plays as a rapper and a drug dealer who winds up bailing the young ladies out of jail when they rob the restaurant. The role does not sound like what &quot;The Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; actress has starred before that provides her niche as a real actress.<br />No Stranger To Television. &quot;Wizards Of Waverly Place&quot; is not Selena Gomez's first hit television show. At the tender age of seven she began appearing on &quot;Barney And Friends&quot; as Gianna. The two have been the best of friends ever since and are happy for each other's success. She has also appeared in other Disney Channel vehicles including &quot;The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana.&quot; Selena Gomez has been such a great success for the Disney Channel, she will surely be cast in several more Disney productions in the years to come.<br />Famous Feud.

Whether true or not, fans must realize that these are very young girls who are essentially growing up in the public eye and are sure to stumble now and then before they reach adulthood.<br />That's so Raven became the networks highest rated series of all time whilst still being making its own history. Other popular shows include: Hannah Montana starring Miley Cyrus, Wizards of Waverly starring Selena Gomez and David Henrie, The Cheetah Girls, Senior school Musical starring Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, Camp Rock starring Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers and much more.<br />I for that reason congratulate Disney for selecting fantastic actors this kind of as Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus for these two demonstrates and it appears to be like like their modify in 'management' has certainly helped raise the fan numbers.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnM_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez Hot</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyaWdnc3Bob3RvLm5ldC9zZWxlbmEtZ29tZXotd2FsbHBhcGVycy8_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnMv" target="_blank">Selena Gomez Hot</a>

Personally she is the girlfriend of teen idol Justin Bieber and UNICEF's youngest ambassador.<br />Layout Locator has over 30 Selena Gomez MySpace layouts for your choosing. Each layout comes with great images of Selena Gomez and bright, funky colors to match whatever colors you've chosen for your MySpace.<br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fembed%2Fcx50FY-E9Ww%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/embed/cx50FY-E9Ww&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />It was also in 2011 that his romantic relationship with Selena Gomez was revealed. Gomez, who has been in show business since she was seven, has starred in several films, won several music awards of her own, and was designated UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2008.<br />Attention, please! It is surprised for me that there is a rumor that the pop star Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have split recently. Gossip says that this is because of his ex-girlfriend Jasmine Villegas. Maybe this news disappoints many fans of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.<br />Meanwhile, Selena Gomez'&quot;on the east coast filming a remake of 'The Getaway' with Ethan Hawke'&quot;is involved in another new movie. This time, it's a thriller to be called 'Aftershock' with Eli Ross. And 'Hotel Transylvania' opens later this month.<br />If this photo really was of Gomez, then people should realize that, also like Cyrus, Gomez is becoming an adult. If these are the photos she wants to take then so be it.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcelebritieshype.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F02%2FSelena-Gomez-Long-Hairstyles-.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://celebritieshype.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Selena-Gomez-Long-Hairstyles-.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />Teen Pop Sensation Justin Bieber had a wonderful night at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards on May 22, 2011 when he was given a sweet kiss from girlfriend Selena Gomez and took home a total of six official trophies including Top New Artist, Top Social Artist, Top Streaming Artist, Top Digital Media Artist, Top Pop Album and Top Streaming Song (video) at his first-ever Billboard Music Awards.<br />Selena Gomez has made her high-fashion debut on the cover of Elle's July 2012 issue.

Justin on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve, so there is no question on how he feels about the former &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; star.<br />At approximately the same time, rumors began circulating that Selena Gomez was pregnant. The rumors, mostly pushed by Twitter devotees, speculated or directly accused Justin of being the father.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg2.timeinc.net%2Finstyle%2Fimages%2F2009%2FGalxMonth%2F06%2F060809-selena-gomez-400.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2009/GalxMonth/06/060809-selena-gomez-400.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />So I'd say it's fair to say that if anyone was poised to take over Miley Cyrus' spot as Tween Queen, its selena gomez. Following are some of the hottest Selena Gomez MySpace layouts and links to where to you can find them.<br />Beau Justin Bieber received awards for Best Pop, Best Male and beat out Miss Gomez for Biggest Fans. Lady Gaga was the immense winner of the night taking home four awards, among them Best Song and Best Video for her hit 'Born This Way.' The vocal powerhouse, Adele, picked up the award for MTV United Kingdom and Ireland / Best United Kingdom and Ireland Act.<br />The MTV Video Music Awards will air on MTV on Sunday, August, 28, 2011 at 8:00 Central Standard Time live from the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. Tune in at 7:00 pm to catch Selena Gomez hosting the VMA pre-show.<br />While at the time of this write-up, Gomez is not attached to any future jobs, it's crystal clear that the common singer and actress will be a effective entertainer for many years to come advert I'm certain there will be lots a lot more Selena Gomez films.<br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fembed%2FUx0QkE9WULQ%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/embed/Ux0QkE9WULQ&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />&quot;Hopeless romantic&quot; is what Selena described her teen idol boyfriend. She said: &quot;If I'll share anything with you, it's that he really is a hopeless romantic. I had just mentioned it in the car  all I said is that I really want to see Titanic again, and then &quot; In fact, Bieber hired out gigantic Los Angeles stadium The Staples Centre in September so the pair could enjoy a private screening of Titanic together. Gomez was really shocked and impressed because of Justin's efforts.<br />Famous Feud. Selena Gomez made headlines in 2008 for supposedly carrying on a feud with another Disney star, Miley Cyrus. The feud was allegedly initiated by Selena dating Nick Jonas, who was previously romantically linked with Miley Cyrus.

Despite paparazzis coming along with the duo all the way, the young celebrity couple couldn't keep their eyes and hands off each other.<br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fembed%2Fb5CcN4OTbyQ%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/embed/b5CcN4OTbyQ&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />The 17-year-old Canadian singer Bieber and his girlfriend were reported to spend their free time together with a late night trip to Disneyland when they had a detour to a nearby smoothie bar. The internet sensation has currently been spending time with his singer girlfriend Selena and her family in Los Angeles.<br />On the pink runway, Selena Gomez stunned in an pearl coloured lace Marchesa dress. Selena Gomez belted out Inferno in a enchanting leather bodice clad dress while a ring of fire erupted all around her. For her performance of 'Hit the Lights' selena flaunted a plum colored rhinestone wardrobe, which consisted of some surprisingly short shorts, and thigh high black boots. Through the course of the show, she made a total of nine outfit changes! From short dresses to gold pants to argyle socks, she was not joking when she said she'd take a risk. The Wizards of Waverly Place celebrity, however, pulled each and every look off with grace and ease.<br />But besides that instance, she has endured death threats, the hacking of her Twitter and Facebook accounts, a fake topless photo, and pregnancy rumors. It might be coincidental, but all these things have occurred since reports like the one in the New York Daily News surfaced of selena gomez being photographed on vacation in the Caribbean just before the new year kissing teen heartthrob Justin Bieber. Three of the four events have a direct Justin Bieber connection. And knowing that Justin has a few maliciously protective fans, one must wonder: Is somebody trying to get Gomez killed?<br />Last time Justin made his way to Selena Gomez was when she was in Florida the day her &quot;We Own the Night&quot; tour stopped there. He went about it very smoothly, he tweeted that he was in Canada and didn't give his fans any reason to think he would show up in Florida.<br />Selena Gomez has beautiful wavy hair. Selena parts her hair to the side with no bangs. Recent pictures of Selena Gomez show her hair above her shoulders. I don't particularly care for this look on her but she may be trying a new trend.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-uO3GqGPRdg4%2FTXU1W805fdI%2FAAAAAAAAAAk%2FJZjCZnS7su0%2Fwww.00%2Fselena-gomez-bikini.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uO3GqGPRdg4/TXU1W805fdI/AAAAAAAAAAk/JZjCZnS7su0/www.00/selena-gomez-bikini.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />In the film the three women travels to Europe on vacation and it centers on two best friends who save up for a girl trip to Paris. The girls are joined by Grace's new step-sister. While in Paris, one of the trio is believed to to be British heiress and the three girls find themselves in the embroiled in media circus. Clearly, Monte Carlo is be the biggest of the Selena Gomez movies with a large budget.<br />Selena Gomez- Throughout the last few years Selena sported some amazingly cute hairstyles that would work great for prom, and anyone who has medium to long hair. She has had messy updo, bobby pin hairstyle, long big curls, and even a messy bob. One of my favorite styles from her is the messy updo she wore back in February of 2010 at the 41st NAACP Image Awards.<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnM_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez Hot</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5icmlnZ3NwaG90by5uZXQvc2VsZW5hLWdvbWV6LXdhbGxwYXBlcnMv" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyaWdnc3Bob3RvLm5ldC9zZWxlbmEtZ29tZXotd2FsbHBhcGVycy8_" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>

The candid conversation aired on Thursday on 'Today' and gave fans a peek at what the future holds for Justin Bieber.<br />selena gomez who is the newest up and coming teen idol has got Miley Cyrus on edge, and from what the rumor mill has to say, Miley is JEALOUS! Or just a nasty person?<br />MTV has announced that Selena Gomez will be the celebrity host of the pre-show for this year's 2011 Video Music Awards that will feature Lady Gaga opening the show with one of her wild and fantastic performances.<br />Pundits around the social networking scene were ruminating that the reason Bieber didn't show up was that the superstar is done with Selena and therefore is not with her in any capacity, including during the opening of her fresh flick in Tinseltown.<br />During the second set, the traditional glow stick war broke out. Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez came prepared with a stash of the colorful plastic toys, which they hurled into the crowd. The couple was expected to leave about then, but the show was too much fun. They 'were having a blast,' a witness said. Justin and Selena stayed until the show was almost over'&quot;then they quietly slipped out the back.<br />&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fembed%2FDReGMYteUo0%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/embed/DReGMYteUo0&quot</a>; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent5.starflash.com%2Farticle-images%2Fw500%2Fselena-gomez-in-dessous-r2.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://content5.starflash.com/article-images/w500/selena-gomez-in-dessous-r2.jpg&quot</a>; alt=&quot;selena gomez&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;/&gt;<br />The caption &quot;Brangelina 2.0 hahahahahaha&quot; sounds like Justin Bieber really wants to build a happy family with Selena Gomez and have as big brood as Hollywood couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do.<br />It was also in 2011 that his romantic relationship with Selena Gomez was revealed. Gomez, who has been in show business since she was seven, has starred in several films, won several music awards of her own, and was designated UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2008.<br />The mad drama involving the Selena Gomez Video and Miley's blatant attack has spurred on for a long time and has created a big divide between Disney's teen fans.
