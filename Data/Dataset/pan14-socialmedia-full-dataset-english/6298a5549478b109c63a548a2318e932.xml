Your ingots are shaped like oxhides and are popular during the eastern Mediterranean world. <br /><br />You method your walled city by means of the farmland that feeds it and are filled with civic pride when you close to the huge walls. Your city is thoroughly up-to-date for its time, with gates set symmetrically and streets crossing at right angles. Not for you the ancient cities with their rabbit warren of twisting alleys. You didnï¿½t call your city Enkomi, but most likely Alasia.<br /><br />Your property is created of good stone. Its several rooms surround a central court, wherever your donkeys are unloaded. Patrick Kane Jersey  In our time, it is possible to see the first few courses of stone and trace the outline of the homes. <br /><br />Very first you, the merchant, need to instruct your scribe to record the shipment.

He writes on the clay tablets so conventional within the Middle East, but uses a simple syllabary, instead than the complicated cuneiform writing.<br /><br />You greet your family and trade your dusty robes for finer, embroidered clothing that befit your wealth. Then you are swiftly off to the industry sector near the port. You would like to hear news of the great battles at Troy. Troy controls the passage to the North Sea, exactly where Cypriot copper is exchanged for wheat and dried fish.

You hear Hittites arguing with Syrians and Egyptians haggling with Cilicians. Nearly all of the folks are robed in brilliantly dyed cloaks, but the Egyptians stand out in their snow-white linen. You uncover your beloved tavern, wherever your cronies welcome you. They wish to know about road circumstances on the way to the copper country. You want to catch up on local news.<br /><br />Following an excellent gossip and perhaps some wine, bread, and olives, you go down to the harbor in the river's edge.

His ship will leave port with ten plenty of copper ingots.<br /><br />And he's informed you some shocking news. You hardly wait to tell your wife the Higher King with the Greeks, Agamemnon, continues to be divorced and deposed at his property in Mycenae. Clytemnestra, the Queen, has taken a brand new husband. This, you recognize, will not end nicely. <br /><br />But very first, you should visit the temple in the Horned God. The Horned God is Hittite and Alasia was under the sway from the Hittite Empire for many centuries. The Hittites deemed Alasia the outer limitsï¿½ and sent their exiles right here. Now the Egyptians have the mastery of Cypriot affairs. But the Horned God has been excellent for your family members, as well as a rapid go to will surely assist your affairs to prosper.<br /><br />Hittites yesterday, Egyptians right now, tomorrow, maybe the upstart Greeks. As long as enterprise is excellent, and pirates are kept to a minimal, you care not a fig which foreign ruler considers himself to be in charge.<br /><br />While you pass the craftsman's quarter, the acrid smell of copper smelting assaults your nose. Right here the copper is further refined, mixed with tin, and created into bronze. Enkomi/Alasia is renowned for its bronze statues and for its tripods, but you'll find any device or weapon you will need on these streets. Patrick Kane Jersey Now the air is sweeter as well as the noise is gentler while you pass the outlets in which fine jewellery is produced. You have just a little gold in your moneybag, maybe you ought to have a trinket produced for your wife. Here would be the ivory carvers. There, which is just the issue  a game board and pieces inlaid with ivory. She loves the Phoenician design.<br /><br />The Phoenicians and Syrians are already coming to Enkomi for hundreds of years. They were often competitive among themselves, but now, with the Mycenaean Greeks elbowing themselves a location, the markets are much more volatile. Patrick Kane Jersey All for the good, for a canny bargainer such as oneself.<br /><br />And now, to house, where you make a rapid but reverent bow to your ancestors buried beneath the floor. How pleasant it's within the courtyard, beneath the grape arbor. Your meal is simple -- bread, fish, olives, figs, wine. Some evening quickly you are going to entertain your online business associates and serve that lamb youï¿½ve been fattening, but for tonight, you are going to dine along with your family members.<br /><br />Related Post: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FpbWVldHRhLmppZ3N5LmNvbS9lbnRyaWVzL2dlbmVyYWwvV2l0aGluLXRoZWlyLVBhdHJpY2stS2FuZS1KZXJzZXktRm9vdHN0ZXBzOi1BLUNvcHBlci1NZXJjaGFudC1pbi1FbmtvbWk_" target="_blank">Within their Patrick Kane Jersey Footsteps: A Copper Merchant in Enkomi</a>
