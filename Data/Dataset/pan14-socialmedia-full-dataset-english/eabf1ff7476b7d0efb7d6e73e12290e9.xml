<br />To start a new and lovely story that will
<br />shine a ray of light upon our hearts
<br />and bring back long lost glory
<br />Of how it used to be
<br />Baby you and me
<br />Convinced we were each others destiny
<br /><br />My heart cries out to you
<br />you must forget me
<br />I've been dancin in the dark
<br />been searching for a spark
<br />A fire still burning
<br /><br />I believe we'll make it through
<br />If you stand by me
<br />We can weather any storm
<br />And keep each other warm
<br />As long as there's love
<br /><br />Every time I think of us
<br />My eyes are filled with tears to think that
<br />I gave in to sweet temptation
<br />His words like music to my ears
<br />I hope it's not too late
<br />That you'd still come wait
<br />and we'd still meet and you're still heaven's
<br />Fate........
<br /><br />My heart cries out to you
<br />you must forget me
<br />I've been dancing in the dark
<br />been searching for a spark
<br />A fire still burning
<br /><br />I believe we will make it through
<br />If you stand by me
<br />We can weather any storm
<br />And keep each other warm
<br />As long as there's love
<br /><br />Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<br /><br />Faith is not mine ,
<br />and if I could id unturn
<br />the hands of time
<br /><br />Oh My heart cries out to you
<br />you must forget me
<br />I've been dancing in the dark
<br />been searching for a spark
<br />I believe we'll make it through
<br />If you stand by me
<br />We can weather any storm
<br />And keep each other warm
<br />As long as there's love
<br />And never enough
<br />And love <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/afro.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/laugh.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />My fathers sitting on the sofa with his friend
<br />He pats the seat in the middle; i sit
<br />Shivering so cold; a quilt he lends
<br /><br />&quot;Jessy you love me don't you&quot; a smile; his
<br />Their breathe spirts weep
<br />&quot;Daddy you know i do; what is it?&quot;
<br />He smiles at his friend; his hand creeps
<br /><br />His friend takes my hand; looks me in the eyes
<br />Daddys creeping up my nightie; cold hands
<br />I try to pull his hand away;
<br />their grip is strong!
<br />They look at one another; nod; something planned
<br /><br />I feel my palms sweat; Daddys under my knickers
<br />&quot;Daddy im going to bed! Night&quot; Pulling again
<br />But there grip is to strong for weak me
<br />I look at both; and ask, who are these men?
<br /><br />His fingers going up me; pulling away
<br />His friend leans forward; a kiss? Why?
<br />His toungue moving mine; my eyes squint
<br />Lean back and away; &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;
<br />No answer, i feel the pain inside me; him
<br />Chucks the quilt on the floor; me to
<br />I try and scamper away, but im not fast
<br />&quot;O Daddy please, i love you&quot;
<br /><br />His friend; pulling at my nightie
<br />And my Dad pulling my pants down
<br />His friend pinning my hands to the floor
<br />As my Dad lies himself on the ground
<br /><br />I squirm; as Daddy friend pulls me up
<br />And places me ontop of Daddy; thrusts within
<br />I cry; i bite; i scratch; i slap; i fail
<br />&quot;O Daddy please you win you win!&quot;
<br /><br />I can feel my skin rip; my virginity breaking free
<br />I can feel the blood seep down my leg
<br />&quot;Daddy your hurting me please&quot;
<br />I plead to him and his friend; not even a beg
<br /><br />Daddys laughing; why does he laugh?
<br />His friend shoves himself in my mouth and moans
<br />Tieing my hands together; moving in and out
<br />&quot;Ride me Jessy&quot; He laughs and groans
<br /><br />They smile at one another; laugh to
<br />They roll me over and spread me wide well
<br />My daddy sits on my face; himself in again
<br />While his friend talks and pushes himself inside
<br /><br />I can hardly breathe; i gag for air
<br />I cough and splutter; cry and weep
<br />I beg and plead; but its no use
<br />Theyve already made me hurt and bleed
<br /><br />I stare into his eyes; that look upon me
<br />This is not my Dad; where is he?
<br />If he was still here; would he care
<br />Would he actually even; see?
<br /><br />Finally they get of and lie me on the sofa
<br />My cheeks blouchy from tears and pain
<br />They play with them selfs; all over me
<br />Rub it in; making me feel the shame
<br /><br />&quot;Why Daddy? Please tell me why?&quot;
<br />Dad looks at his friend; and waves him away
<br />&quot;Jessy i love you&quot; he smiles and kisses my cheek
<br />&quot;Is that all you have in your heart to say?&quot;
<br /><br />He puts my nightie on me
<br />he walks me to my bedroom door
<br />Ever since that night; His friend
<br />And himself every Friday come back for more
<br /><br />&quot;Night sweet Girl; You are my life&quot;
<br />Closing the door, tears still down my face
<br />Still the smell of him and his friend
<br />Fade into me like disgrace
<br /><br />I watch the Moon go down; the sun come up
<br />&quot;Jessy its school&quot; Knocking at my door
<br />I cant help but cry; weep in pain
<br />Because im so scared he wanted more
<br /><br />But one night daddy took it too far
<br />Daddy and his friend came back for one last shot
<br />They were worried they would get caught
<br />So he and his friend took me to a cemetary lot
<br /><br />I was blindfolded and my hands were tied back
<br />&quot;Daddy please!! Not tonight!&quot;
<br />Daddy and his friend both had their last fun
<br />After that i tried to put up a fight
<br /><br />I begged daddy &quot;Please no more!&quot;
<br />All he could say &quot;Shut up, you stupid Bitch!&quot;
<br />Daddy unblindfolded me at last
<br />He said I love you so much
<br /><br />He went back into the car and pulled out a bat
<br />&quot;Daddy I swear I wont say a thing!!!!&quot;
<br />I was dead
<br />After only one swing..........................
<br /><br />**... Please if you care for all the children and women who have been raped
<br />repost this bulletin with the Headline &quot;daddy please no&quot;

<br /><br />We don't care if you talk to other guys.
<br /><br />We don't care if you're friends with other guys.
<br /><br />But when you're sitting next to us, and some random guy walks into the room and you jump up and tackle him, without even introducing us, yeah, it pisses us off.
<br /><br />It doesn't help if you sit there and talk to him for ten minutes without even acknowledging the fact that we're still there.
<br /><br />We don't care if a guy calls you, but at 2 in the morning we do get a little concerned. Nothing is that important at 2 a.m. that it can't wait till the morning.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Also, when we tell you you're pretty/ beautiful/ gorgeous/ cute/ stunning, we freaking mean it.
<br /><br />Don't tell us we're wrong.
<br /><br />We'll stop trying to convince you.
<br /><br />The sexiest thing about a girl is confidence.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Yeah, you can quote me.
<br /><br />Push us down on the couch and make a move once in a while. We like that aggressiveness about you and we like the unexpected. When we know you're really happy, it makes us happy too.
<br /><br />You always want us to show you our affection, but it works both ways. Don't wait for us to grab your hand or put our arms around you (although we should do this anyway), make the first move every once in a while, that way we know you care about us as much as we care about you.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Don't be mad when we hold the door open.
<br />Take Advantage of the mood im in.
<br /><br />LET US PAY FOR YOU!
<br /><br />DON'T &quot;FEEL BAD&quot;
<br /><br />We enjoy doing it (Paying for you).
<br /><br />It's expected.
<br /><br />Smile and say &quot;thank you.&quot;
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Kiss us when no one's watching.
<br /><br />If you kiss us when you know nobody's looking we'll be more impressed.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />You don't have to get dressed up for us.
<br /><br />If we're going out with you in the first place, you don't have to feel the need to wear the shortest skirt you have or put on every kind of makeup you own.
<br /><br />We like you for WHO you are and not WHAT you are.
<br /><br />honestly, i think a girl looks more beautiful when she's just in her pj's. or my tshirt and boxers, not all dolled up
<br /><br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Don't take everything we say seriously.
<br /><br />Sarcasm is a beautiful thing. See the beauty in it.
<br /><br />Don't get angry easily.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Stop using magazines/media as your bible.
<br /><br />***Don't talk about how hott Morris Chesnutt, Brad Pitt, or Taye Diggs is in front of us.
<br /><br />***It's boring, and we don't care.
<br />You have girlfriends for that.
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Whatever happened to the word &quot;handsome&quot;/&quot;beautiful&quot;
<br /><br />I'd be utterly stunned by a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hey
<br />handsome!&quot; instead of &quot;Hey baby/ stud/ cutie/ sexy&quot; or whatever else you can think of.
<br /><br />on the other hand im not saying I wouldn't like it either ; )
<br />__________________________
<br />___________________
<br /><br />_______
<br />Girls, I cannot stress this enough:
<br />IF YOU AREN'T BEING TREATED RIGHT BY A GUY, DON'T WAIT FOR HIM TO CHANGE. DITCH HIS SORRY, DISGRACE-TO-THE-MALE-POPUL
<br />ATION SELF, AND FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL TREAT YOU WITH UTTER RESPECT
<br /><br />Someone who will honor your morals.
<br /><br />Someone who will make you smile when you're at your lowest.
<br /><br />Someone who will care for you even when you make mistakes.
<br /><br />ENJOY A GOOD MAN...THEY ARE HARD TO COME BY IN A DAY AND AGE AS WE LIVE IN WHERE PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SHIT....LONESTAR
<br /><br />Someone who will love you, no matter how bad you make them feel.
<br /><br />Someone who will stop what theyre doing just to look you in the
<br />eyes....and say &quot;i love you&quot; ...
<br /><br />....AND ACTUALLY MEAN IT!
<br /><br />Give the nice guys a chance!!!!!!
<br /><br />**************************
<br />*******************
<br /><br />*****
<br /><br />Guys repost this if you agree
<br /><br />Girls repost this if you think it's cute
<br /><br />Every Guy who isn't a jerk will agree with this, so we hope that all the girls that read this will repos

I've always left my feelings left un-said. I'm just too afraid you might feel the same way. It's hard going through your teen years keeping so much feeling locked up in your heart knowing that you want to tell him but you can't.
<br />Only if you knew.
<br />Now all that i can do is get over you... some how<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />and thats to actually have someone care about me.
<br />like come on i fucking have cancer and my parents don't even pay attention to me.
<br />Im kinda glad im sick, i want to die anyways.
<br />i can't even get a decent guy to apreciate me.
<br />someone just kill me now.
<br />i can't deal with both having an oddly abusive dad, a jesus freak mom and both in which don't give a shit about me at all.
<br />Im sick and they just don't want to pay for the health bill.
<br />i like a guy who's always on my mind and i can't get him off.
<br />He's looks at some other girl like she means the world to him and i just sit there wishing i was her.
<br />What else can i do.
