All of us have debt, this seems to be the nature of life, but we have to ask ourselves why our debt usually equals or is greatger than what we can afford?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really quite simple. This is what they want and this is how the credit card companies make it rich.  Sadly they actually like for us to fall behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people like to get paid on time, but your creditors actually want the opposite.  They want you to be late!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted your creditors don’t want you to be too late or to not make payments at all, but a a couple of weeks is perfect. Let’s take a look at what late payments on your account means to your creditors. You still make payments, but you are a week or two late. Their penalty for late payments is $30. the credit card companies just made $30 for doing nothing! You are at your limint as it is, so this penalty puts you over its max. Essentially earning them an addition $30 for, again, what? Nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you are able to make your minimum payment of twenty dollars. basically this doesn't work in your favor. Let’s just say you've got fifteen dollars in interest for the current payment period. Your total charges for the month come to; fifteen dollars in interest + $30 late charge + $30 over limit fee, equiling $75 charged to your account. You pay $20 towards the account, which leaves you $55 more then when you started and basically have nothing to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This proves that credit cards are bad and we have to learn to get by without them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first step in the process is to gather up all of your credit cards and get rid of them. If you absolutely need a card save one, but get rid of the rest. Just pick the one with the least amount of interest and hopefully one with no annual fee. Put your card in a safe spot that is not easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looks extreme, but many individualsa do not have the ability to restrain themselves to basically not use the account. the majority of people look at their account balance, notice there is fifty dollars or $100 in available credit and look at it as money they can spend. We all know that there is no such thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you could not bring yourself to cancelling your cards, defiantely put them together in a box up and store them somewhere that would take some effort to access. The freezer is probably a great idea. Also, you may want to have someboby that you trust keep them or hide them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is not to have access to them for those un-nessasary purchases that people come across all the time. As soon as we pass the situation, chances are that we will recognize that we have no need to buy that item and probably will forget about it by the time we get home. By doing this we're even closer to eliminating our debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t forget to eliminate the cards that you dont want to use. Most credit cards have an yearly fee, which could be anywhere from thirty dollars to $100. This is an un-nessasary expense that you should use towards the outstanding amount.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;usually accounts may charge you an amount to make you think abbout staying with them. At this point you should analyze the impact. I cancelled a card not to long ago that is charging me $3.50 a month in closed account fees. Lets say your annual charge is $59, twelve months at $3.50 is forty two dollars. I'm still ahead of the game by $17, possibly more, if I pay it off within 12 months. The most important thing is that there is no way that I can use that account again and worsen your situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the temptation is out of the way you can start paying them off. Keep in mind that you need to pay at least the monthly payment, pay all cards on time, and stop using the accounts. Now step back and enjoy the road to financial freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg Martin is an experience debt counsellor with over a decade of knowledge in the debt consolidation industry.

Afterwards on this sequence we'll discover this particular subject matter in depth, but for now, merely consider this: In case a single mother is actually struck having a unexpected, unpredicted expenditure : say a vehicle repair for $600 - what can your woman carry out if she doesn't have the amount of money? Your woman wants the car to access work, and she or he does not know anybody who are able to be able to provide the girl the cash from companionship. So the lady chooses to utilize the area cash advance go shopping and winds up having to pay a 530 pct Interest rates (annual percentage rate) attention. When, instead, she had a charge card together with a minimum of $600 of accessible credit rating, your woman would not experienced to make use of the particular pay day charlatans, as well as would have paid out a lot, lower interest rate. Many people that utilize pay day loan providers, actually as soon as, belong to a great unavoidable spin out of control associated with credit card debt, in which they function almost all week to repay their own pay day loans, then have to take out new payday loans to fulfill their particular each week costs.
