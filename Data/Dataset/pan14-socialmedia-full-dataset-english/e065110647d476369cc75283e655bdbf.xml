As the exciting day approaches, we do anticipate a remarkable wedding, with best wishes from our families and friends and sincere marriage vow from the better half. We have known each other for more than 4 years and gone through too much in the meanwhile. We have also reached a consensus that the wonderful memories should be recorded in remembrance of our everlasting love. 
<br /><br />So what is the best way to get our good old days recorded? As a digital photography fan, the first idea that came to my mind was to burn all our photos into a DVD disc. I then started to collect and sort all our photos and saved them to a folder in my computer. All of them took up to 2GB of my hard drive space. I inserted a DVD disc into my computer and began to burn the photos with the built-in DVD burner in my Windows 7 system. The burning process went very smoothly, yet the result was not that satisfying as expected. This idea failed and I had to give it up.
<br /><br />Actually, what I had expected was a DVD slideshow with all our photos. When playing the DVD on TV with a DVD player, what needed to be shown in front of us was a dynamic photo slide show with theme songs and sort of decoration effects. At this point, the DVD created using the built-in DVD burner in my computer was just too plain and monotone. 
<br /><br />After doing a search for DVD slideshow software on Google for some time, I finally got the software I really needed. It was <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kdmQtcGhvdG8tc2xpZGVzaG93LmNvbQ__" target="_blank">DVD Photo Slideshow</a> developed by Socusoft. I felt so happy as this piece of slideshow software happened to have wedding themes. What's more, it let me put photos from different folders into different albums, in which way I could better organize our photos. For example, I could create an album with all my fiancée's photos, another album with all my photos, and a third album with all our photos. Also, I could make albums by genre of place, year, festival, etc. In total, there were 76 themes that could be used to decorate the albums. Several of them could be applied to a wedding slideshow. Since I was going to make a DVD slideshow, I certainly needed to choose a DVD menu that best fitted the wedding slide show. And there were also wedding menu templates in DVD Photo Slideshow. To be honest, the cool album themes and DVD menu templates were the primary reason why I chose DVD Photo Slideshow among a lot of other similar program.
<br /><br />Like other DVD slideshow programs, DVD Photo Slideshow can create a slideshow with background music, transitions, Pan&amp;Zoom, art clips, text, subtitles and more. I'm not going to elaborate them here. The last point is that DVD Photo Slideshow also lets users save the slideshow project as a video files and it offers optimized presets for popular portable devices such as iPad, iPhone, PSP, Zune, Creative Zen, Mobile Phone and more. As far as I am concerned, I am going to output all my albums in DVD Photo Slideshow to video files for viewing on my newly purchased Galaxy Tab. Hope the output quality won't let me down.
<br /><br />At last, I'd like to say when I presented the slideshow DVD to my fiancée; she was very happy and truly touched by me. All my efforts paid off.

These DRM-protected songs are locked so that they only work with Apple MP3 players. That means that if you bought a Microsoft Zune, you cannot use iTunes music.
<br /><br />So, what is the solution? You have to burn a CD. When you do this, the DRM is removed (because the music is converted to a non-DRM-compatible media). After you burn the CD, you can rip it to your PC as an MP3 file which no longer has DRM.
<br /><br />1. Insert a CD-R or CD-RW disc into your CD-ROM drive. 
<br />2. Burn your playlist to make an &quot;Audio CD&quot;. You cannot select the &quot;MP3 CD&quot; option since it requires the DRM protected iTunes music files be converted to (DRM free) MP3. 
<br />3. After the audio CD is successfully burned, insert the disc into your CD-ROM drive again. Then you can use iTunes to import the music tracks on the burned disc as MP3 files. 
<br /><br />Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50dW5lY2xvbmUuY29t" target="_blank">TuneClone</a>. TuneClone makes a virtual CD-ROM drive, tricking your PC into believing that you are burning a CD. Therefore, the DRM is removed without wasting a CD. Below is the step by step tutorial using TuneClone and iTunes 9.0.2 to convert M4P to MP3.
<br /><br /><strong>Step 1. Download and install TuneClone</strong>
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50dW5lY2xvbmUuY29t" target="_blank"><strong>TuneClone</strong></a> is compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista (except Vista 64 bit) and Mac OS X 10.5 or above.
<br /><br />(<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy50dW5lY2xvbmUuY29tL3R1bmVjbG9uZV9zZXR1cC5leGU_" target="_blank">Windows Version</a> | <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hYy50dW5lY2xvbmUuY29tL3R1bmVjbG9uZS1tYWMuZG1n" target="_blank">Mac Version</a>)

<br /><br /><strong>Step 2. Create a new playlist in iTunes</strong>
<br /><br />Create a new playlist, and add the iTunes songs you want to convert to the playlist. 
<br /><br /><strong>Step 3. Make burning settings in iTunes</strong>
<br /><br />Right click the playlist you just created and choose &quot;Burn Playlist to Disc&quot;. Or you can select part of songs from the playlist and click the &quot;Burn Disc&quot; at the bottom right corner of iTunes interface. In the pop-up dialog of &quot;Burn Settings&quot;, make the settings as highlighted below:

<br /><br /><strong>Step 4. Start burning</strong>
<br /><br />Click the &quot;Burn&quot; button to start burning. After the burning gets started, TuneClone will automatically convert the iTunes music to MP3 files. You can open the manager screen to show all the converted music files.
<br /><br /><strong>Tip:</strong> The most important step is to choose the CD burner. Then TuneClone Audio Converter will convert the music files automatically. It is exceedingly easy when you want to batch convert lots of files.

It is divided into three parts: 
<br /><br /><strong>Part 1. How to download videos from YouTube?</strong>
<br /><br />I'd like to recommend using the online YouTube downloader called GrabTube to download videos from YouTube. With this online converter, you can download and convert YouTube video to MP3, 3GP, AVI, FLV or MPG. It is as easy to use as: 
<br /><br />1. Browse on over to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grab-tube.com%2Fconverter"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.grab-tube.com/converter</a> where the converter lives and you will see a screen that looks like this: 
<br /><br />2. The URL bar at the top of the screen lets you simply paste a URL of the YouTube video to download. Drop down the format next to it and hit the download button. 
<br /><br />3. You will see the next screen with links to download the file to your computer. With the file, you can then use the service to convert it to another file type. 
<br /><br /><strong>Part 2. How to convert YouTube videos to AVI/WMV for Windows Movie Maker?</strong>
<br /><br />The videos downloaded using GrabTube are in MP4/3GP/FLV format. In order to put them onto Windows Movie Maker, you still need to convert the videos to AVI/WMV format. I always use <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbG9uZTJnby5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdmlkZW9jb252ZXJ0ZXIucGhw" target="_blank">Clone2Go Video Converter</a> to convert between common video formats including AVI and WMV. Apart from a video converter, this piece of software can also be used to download videos from YouTube. So, back to Part 1, if the size of the video you are going to download from YouTube is larger than 40 MB or if you failed to get a high Internet connection, you can just give this video converter a shot. 
<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> Windows Movie Maker needs external codec to decode mp4, xvid and mpeg2 video. To skip this trouble, please select &quot;Customized AVI Movie(*.avi)&quot; profile and adjust &quot;video codec&quot; to &quot;msmpeg4v2&quot;, &quot;video size&quot; to &quot;Original&quot; to get AVI video accepted by Windows Movie Maker. 
<br /><br /><strong>Part 3. How to put YouTube videos to Windows Movie Maker?</strong>
<br /><br />After you get the output video clip downloaded and converted from YouTube, now you can begin to put it into your Windows Movie Maker. 
<br /><br />Click on &quot;File&quot;. Then click on &quot;Import into collections&quot;. A window will appear. In the window, navigate to the video clip you downloaded and converted from YouTube just now. Then double click on the file. You'll see the icon for the file in your Windows Movie Maker &quot;Collections&quot;. 
<br /><br /><strong>About Windows Movie Maker:</strong>
<br /><br />Windows Movie Maker is a totally free program that comes with Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Professional, and Windows Vista (also called Windows DVD Maker). Below are the media formats accepted by Windows Movie Maker: 
<br /><br />Video files: .asf, .avi, .wmv
<br />Movie files: MPEG1, .mpeg, .mpg, .mlv, .mp2
<br />Audio files: .wav, .snd, .au, .aif, .aifc, .aiff
<br />Windows media files: .asf, .wm, .wma, .wmv
<br />MP3 format audio: .mp3
