<br />Nothing is what it seems
<br />Searching my head
<br />For the words that you said
<br /><br />Tears filled my eyes
<br />As we said our last goodbyes
<br />This sad scene replays
<br />Of you walking away
<br /><br />My body aches from mistakes
<br />Betrayed by lust
<br />We lied to each other so much
<br />That in nothing we trust
<br /><br />Time and again,
<br />She repeats let's be friends
<br />I smile and say yes
<br />Another truth bends,
<br />I must confess
<br /><br />I try to let go, but I know
<br />We'll never end 'til we're dust
<br />We lied to each other again
<br />But I wish I could trust
<br /><br />My body aches from mistakes
<br />Betrayed by lust
<br />We lied to each other so much
<br />That in nothing we trust
<br /><br />God help me please, on my knees
<br />Betrayed by lust
<br />We lied to each other so much
<br />That in nothing we trust
<br /><br />How could this be happening to me
<br />I'm lying when I say &quot;Trust me&quot;
<br />I can't believe this is true
<br />Trust hurts
<br />Why does trust equal suffering
<br /><br />Absolutely nothing we trust

<br />Not before we torment you from your cell straight to hell with a short detour in-between.
<br />Begging for mercy all alone, unable to handle the pressure.
<br />Before his mortification!
<br />Now let the torture begin!
<br /><br />Death by the head crusher
<br />Head crusher!
<br />Death by the head crusher!
<br /><br />The horrific torture device for those who fail interrogation,
<br />The most painful technique ever known,
<br />People thirst for the worst, the skulls disintegration.
<br />Beaten, broken, in bloody rags
<br />Adding insult to injury, he recants
<br />But it's much too late.
<br />Now let the torture begin!
<br /><br />Death by the head crusher
<br />Head crusher!
<br />Death by the head crusher!
<br /><br />On your knees, prisoner, take your position
<br />Place your chin forward into the restraint
<br />Your head slowly caves in from the compression
<br />You fade in a blackout from the infernal pain
<br /><br />Twisting, turning the giant screw
<br />Your teeth are breaking loose
<br />Crushed and splintering into your mouth
<br /><br />Winding down, cutting through
<br />Like broken glass being chewed
<br />The fragmented skull and shattering bones
<br /><br />There's nothing you can do.

<br />dwell on for a new age
<br />so long sleep well my friend
<br />take him back to Avalon

<br />We are gathered
<br />Waiting to see
<br />A glimpse of paradise
<br /><br />In the twilight
<br />Chains now rattle
<br />Screams of agony
<br />We´re all eyes
<br /><br />See the king’s knight,
<br />Priests and followers
<br />Preparing their feast
<br />Their torches burning bright
<br /><br />See the king’s knight
<br />Choose among the prisoners
<br />This one will die before day light!!!
<br /><br />The gates will open at sunrise
<br />The prisoners will be brought out
<br />They will pay for their sins now
<br />And make the crowd scream and shout
<br /><br />First confessions and burning fire
<br />- Hallelujah -
<br />Then they will be judged before the lord
<br />Gypsies, witches, thieves and murderers
<br />The celebration starts afterwards
<br /><br />In the dark night no
<br />One pays attention
<br />The music is loud
<br />The celebration´s on
<br /><br />In the dark night
<br />Chains now rattle
<br />They´ve come to take away
<br />Your only son
<br /><br />The gates will open at sunrise
<br />The prisoners will be brought out
<br />They will pay for their sins now
<br />And make the crowd scream and shout
<br /><br />First confessions and burning fire
<br />- Hallelujah -

<br />And the moon from my sky was gone with stars
<br />I came home to a bleak room of sorrow
<br />Forsaken house, place of grief, in solitude
<br /><br />I listened to my heart beating
<br />The faint rush of my blood
<br />I listened to my heart beating
<br />The echoes from space
<br /><br />Something moving in the emptiness
<br />Something drew me near
<br />Someone told me of my future deeds
<br />Whispered them in my ear
<br /><br />The sky stirred
<br />The lights of space flared
<br />Beneath my feet
<br />The living earth started to breath
<br /><br />The sky is mine
<br />This sword is mine
<br />This fate is mine
<br />This miracle, mine
<br /><br />From steel I made the master's sword
<br />Cleaving stone, cliff, a mountain
<br />From darkness I stepped
<br />Onto the path of stars

<br />Want to be like all my hero's are
<br />Will I die before I'm old; live the life of rock n' roll
<br />Travel all the highways of the world.
<br /><br />I took the easy way
<br />Turned my back and walked away
<br />Didn't have the courage or the will
<br />Sometimes it's hard to say
<br />Question what I did that day
<br />Now I know I'll hide away no more.
<br /><br />Never again will I hide myself in shadows
<br />Never again will I look the other way
<br />Never again will I take the easy option
<br />Never again, I won't wait another day.
<br /><br />And now I'm standing here, metal anthems fill the air
<br />Playing through the songs you all wanted to hear
<br />Without you we will fall, you're the ones who heed the call
<br />You're the ones who make the dream come true.
<br /><br />I took the easy way
<br />Turned my back and walked away
<br />Didn't have the courage or the will
<br />Sometimes it's hard to say
<br />Question what I did that day
<br />Now I know I'll hide away no more.
<br /><br />Never again will I hide myself in shadows
<br />Never again will I look the other way
<br />Never again will I take the easy option
<br />Never again, I won't wait another day.
<br /><br />Sometimes it seems another chance won't come my way
<br />Won't stop believing that it might just be my day
<br /><br />Never again will I hide myself in shadows
<br />Never again will I look the other way
<br />Never again will I take the easy option
<br />Never again, I won't wait another day

<br />Out with the light and
<br />Then up and down it goes
<br /><br />Fly
<br />Out with the light
<br />There at the door

<br />The spirit of the youth appears
<br /><br />No one ever dares to speak
<br />It's nothing else but fantasy
<br />It's make believe
<br />Make believe
<br /><br />No one ever dares to speak
<br />It's nothing else but fantasy
<br />But one day
<br />It all will come to life
<br /><br />Step out of line
<br />And I'll teach you how to fly
<br />Then away we'll go
<br />Leave your mark land of mine
<br />Leave your mark
<br />In the land of mine
<br /><br />The second one to right
<br />And then straight on
<br />Until morning light
<br /><br />Stop be quite now
<br />No irritation
<br />No, not the slightest doubt
<br /><br />We got once
<br />Quick - we better hurry
<br />There from the road I sense
<br />The end of fun gets near
<br />Wonderful thoughts
<br />And imaginations
<br />These things will lift you up
<br /><br />What is it like?
<br />You ask me, my dear
<br />Will there be fairies
<br />Or things to fear?
<br />For fairies sake I'd say
<br />You better come with me
<br />So soon you'll see
<br />Now up and down it goes
<br />And round
<br />Round and round and round
<br /><br />Praise
<br />To my cleverness
<br />They all follow me
<br />All praise to innocence
<br />That's everything it needs
<br />Fly in
<br />Fly out
<br />They'll leave it all behind
<br /><br />No one ever dares to speak...
<br /><br />Life is a map
<br />And it is quite confusing
<br />The lights are up
<br />Now let the play begin
<br />She flies, she flies
<br />Into the light she flies
<br />No words like &quot;Just&quot; in mind
<br />She's finding Neverland
<br />There on the day she dies
<br />Don't stop it now
<br />She still enjoys the scene
<br />Don't stop it now
<br />Don't stop it now
<br />Don't stop it now
<br />Don't stop it now, now, now
<br /><br />No one ever dares to speak...
