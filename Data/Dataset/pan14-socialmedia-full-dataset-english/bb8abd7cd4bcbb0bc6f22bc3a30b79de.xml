This alliance of like-minded aviation interests because they saw a clear need to meet the rising demand for international travel. The ending of the war had and amazing effect, because it was once again safe to fly. European skies were filled with flights not long after the company was created. They already had existing infrastructure and fleet assets available to them. The result over the years to come was a dedicated effort to provide quality service as well as taking advantage of new alliances.<br /><br />During the mid 1950s, SAS, which stands for Scandinavian Airlines, became known. This company was the first airline in the world to make a trans-polar flight.<br /><br />That means they flew across the top of the earth, the North Pole. The actual flight originated in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the destination was Los Angeles, California. Actually, this was a very smart move on the part of SAS. The explanation is that they gained a huge amount of prominence as well as business from the movie industry in Hollywood. As a result, the route between Europe and the US west coast became more expedient. In 2004, SAS was redistributed into four separate companies in order to improve production and profitability. Sweden, along with the other two countries, Denmark and Norway, combined with SAS international, is the result of this new company design. Any transcontinental flight is handled by the SAS global division. SAS Scandinavian System AB, however, is the current version of this singular company. Despite its reunion, on paper and digitally this company still looks like four separate sections.<br /><br />To this date, Scandinavian Airlines holds the reputation as a global air passenger carrier. Two of the long-distance destinations of SAS are to Asia and North America. The two primary hubs for SAS are Stockholm Sweden and Copenhagen Denmark, and it is from these locations that most international traffic is served. Scandinavian Airlines International-SAS is the division that handles all intercontinental routes along with any sales units outside Scandinavia. They employ almost 1,000 people. This international division is independent from the operations divisions of each of the three countries - Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. There are impressive logistical concerns that Scandinavian Airlines faces since it is owned across three separate countries. However, they have been operating in this style almost since the beginning. Despite its obvious differences with how other airlines are managed, it does well with this precise format. The amount of business that they currently have allows them to perpetuate their success.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheapromanticweekendgetaways62.wikispaces.com%2FThe%2BStoried%2BHistory%2Bof%2BScandinavian%2BAirlines"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cheapromanticweekendgetaways62.wikispaces.com/The+Storied+History+of+Scandinavian+Airlines</a>

The oddity of its beginnings had to do with those that started the company and their ability to provide passenger assets. However, do not forget all of the right choices that were made each and every year that brought them success. Understanding the airline industry was a key component to their monetary success along with their combined skills and efforts. The spoils of business success go to those who have vision and are willing to take chances. In the next few paragraphs, the legacy of Scandinavian Airlines will be detailed.<br /><br />It came as no surprise when these three Scandinavian countries formed the consortium that became known as SAS. The airline was launched in 1946, just one year after WW 2 ended. The end of WW II marked the beginning of a new era around the world and that enthusiasm lead, logically, to this alliance. After the formation in August of 1946, actual flights were launched on 17 September 1946. The Swedish flag carrier AB Aerotransport joined SAS in 1948 and the companies merged and created the SAS Consortium in 1951. At that time, the ownership was divided equally by the private investors and the combined total of three countries equaling 50%. Redistributed into four different entities, SAS became a more functional and effective company in 2004. The four divisions include Norway, SAS international, Sweden, and ownership by Denmark. You can also find the latter listed as SAS Global which implies transcontinental passenger services. However, in late 2009, they once again reformed into one company, from a business entity perspective, SAS Scandinavian System AB. However, they are still represented publicly as being separate.<br /><br />Currently, SAS continues its traditional role as an international airline. North America and Asia are two of Scandinavian Airline's long-distance international destinations. The two primary hubs for SAS are Stockholm Sweden and Copenhagen Denmark, and it is from these locations that most international traffic is served. SAS International is the division that handles the intercontinental traffic for SAS and employs slightly less than 1,000 people. This international division is independent from the operations divisions of each of the three countries - Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. <br /><br />Separate business divisions were created for each of Scandinavian Airlines different service areas. Since its inception, SAS has operated mostly as an alliance between the different airlines in its group and its financial investors. But eventually, the partner airlines became merged with the overall conglomerate that is known worldwide as SAS. The SAS Group's average number of employees was 15,379 in the first quarter of 2009, and they are divided among Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fboblynn24.livejournal.com%2F657.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://boblynn24.livejournal.com/657.html</a>

There is an attention-grabbing demonstration if an airline has the ability to stay up and running for multiple decades. The simplest explanation is that the airline business is one of the most arduous in the world.<br /><br />You are faced with the slimmest of profit margins as well as other pressures. The aviation industry, in general, is closely aligned with, and dependent on, the strength of national and world economies. Following business sequences is something that airline companies do, whether it happens to be a thriving or an impoverished time. Therefore with that being said, let us gain some knowledge about Scandinavian Airlines, a one-of-a-kind company, by analyzing it.<br /><br />Air carrier operations for international travel is the responsibility of SAS Global. The number one airline operating in the group of nations known as Scandinavia is Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS). North America and Asia are just 2 of the more than 100 destinations that Scandinavian Airlines flies to. SAS formed the Star Alliance during the 1990s with a group of airlines and is considered a part of the consortium. <br /><br />Scandinavian Airlines did what any other airline would do and actually has done around the world. They sought ways to enlarge and seize as much market share as possible. The end product was that they took care of business and eventually succeeding in their efforts to garner the domestic flights within Scandinavia. Gaining full or partial control of the smaller airlines operating in their domestic area was how they accomplished this feat. Working hard to do the same around the world they were able to acquire Air Canada and the company that owned Continental Airlines.<br /><br />The terrorist threats and 9/11 garnered massive changes involving security. In 2006, the Swedish division of SAS implemented a biometric fingerprint identification system to augment and bolster existing security measures. Sweden was the only place to use that particular system. To match the luggage with the correct owner the biometric system is being used. SAS Norway uses the biometric system since 2006. <br /><br />Scandinavia and Europe boast some of the foremost central points for the international airline called Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Being held by public stock ownership and owned by three different countries, this major airline sets a remarkable example. The early years of SAS demonstrated how innovation with travel routes could prove to be very lucrative. The company was able to garner tremendous public awareness by their bold move to establish new air routes.<br /><br />Due to predictions by the management in the company, a huge part of their accomplishments took place because of their predictions of the future, during the late 1900s.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmostromanticgetaways.com%2Ftips-for-cheap-romantic-getaways"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://mostromanticgetaways.com/tips-for-cheap-romantic-getaways</a>

Scandinavian Airlines, as well as the other fledgling airlines, shared many common traits, among them strength and endurance. Running an airline, and putting it into profits, is a tough job for any capable person. Two characteristics that consistently show up in the most successfully run airlines are a readiness to take risks and make innovative decisions. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) exhibited these traits in 1954 when they became the first airline to operate a trans-polar route between Copenhagen and Los Angeles. This move, which made them very popular, also brought in a whole new category of passengers and profits. The story of Scandinavian Airlines is very interesting and our goal is to tell more about SAS.<br /><br />It made sense for the Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to form the consortium that became SAS. World War II ended in 1945 and this company was launched on 1 August 1946, one year later. A new sense of renewal spread across the world at the end of WW II and, with this intent, no one was surprised at the formation of this company. One month after the founding of this company, in September of 1946, the first flight took place. By the 1950s, and as a result of additional airlines joining and merging with SAS, the SAS consortium was created. After the ownership share amounts were divided and attributed to each country, the individual countries divided their share 50/50 between their government and private investors. Redistributed into four different entities, SAS became a more functional and effective company in 2004. Sweden, along with the other two countries, Denmark and Norway, combined with SAS international, is the result of this new company design. SAS Global is the other name for SES international which handles the transcontinental services of the company. SAS Scandinavian System AB, however, is the current version of this singular company. Despite its reunion, on paper and digitally this company still looks like four separate sections.<br /><br />Currently, SAS continues its traditional role as an international airline. Two of the long-distance destinations of SAS are to Asia and North America. Copenhagen Airport, Denmark is the main European and Inter-Continental hub and the other two main hubs in Sweden are Stockholm-Arlanda Airport and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Scandinavian Airlines International-SAS is the division that handles all intercontinental routes along with any sales units outside Scandinavia. They employ almost 1,000 people. This international division is independent from the operations divisions of each of the three countries - Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. <br /><br />Scandinavia and Europe boast some of the foremost central points for the international airline called Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Being held by public stock ownership and owned by three different countries, this major airline sets a remarkable example. In the beginning stages, SAS revealed that the advancement of travel routes could turn out to be very rewarding. After making an audacious move to launch new air routes, the airline was able to gain a lot of attention from the public.<br /><br />A good deal of the achievements made by the company came about because of the predictions the management had during the end of the 20th century.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3Da434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3Da434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253aa434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158Post%253a0ab141c6-6288-4c37-b2ac-1ce9afb28e09%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=a434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=a434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3aa434267a83194128a2c4e27324d77158Post%3a0ab141c6-6288-4c37-b2ac-1ce9afb28e09&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>

International travel was on the rise, therefore the creation of the alliance of like-minded aviation interests was created. The ending of the war had and amazing effect, because it was once again safe to fly. Flight operations in the European skies took place not long after the company was created. They already had existing infrastructure and fleet assets available to them. With new alliances formed there was a dedicated effort to provide quality service.<br /><br />If you fly quite a bit, you probably have noticed that each airline has the flag of their country of origin. This aviation tradition is rooted perhaps from a sense of pride that is natural and understandable. The business foundation of Scandinavian Airlines is rooted in cooperation and sharing. There are a few partners that are involved, one of which is Denmark. However half of the company is publicly owned and funded through public shares. Scandinavian Airlines is the primary airline that is based in Scandinavia. Maintaining 180 destinations worldwide, this fleet of 198 aircraft is busy most of the time. <br /><br />Another brilliant business move for Scandinavian Airlines occurred in 1997. Scandinavian Airlines, plus United Airlines, Air Canada, Thai Airways and Lufthansa put together a network they called the Star Alliance.<br /><br />This network of global airlines was part of a long term strategy that culminated in the formation of the alliance. There was a major overhaul of the organization in 2001 which turned into Scandinavian Airlines ownership being split up between public ownership through, as well as possession by three Scandinavian countries. The three countries that are entailed are Sweden, Norway and Denmark. However the businesses shareholdings of public stocks remain at 50%.<br /><br />The terrorist threats and 9/11 garnered massive changes involving security. The biometric fingerprint identification system was implemented by the Swedish division of SAS in 2006. This particular system is used within Sweden, though, since it was instituted by Swedish SAS. To match the luggage with the correct owner the biometric system is being used. SAS Norway has started using this system, but makes it very clear to passengers that it is strictly voluntary. <br /><br />Because of the aggressive acquisition efforts of Scandinavian Airlines, they have seen pay offs over the years. They were instrumental in the creation of the global Star Alliance group of airlines during the 90s. To provide extra financial security and to increase the capabilities of each airline the business coalition exists. It is much like a strength in numbers approach which is understandable in the hyper competitive world of air travel and aviation. Denmark, Sweden and Norway are three of the divisions of the SAS since the late 1990's. SAS Global is the international flight division.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailystrength.org%2Fpeople%2F833451%2Fjournal"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailystrength.org/people/833451/journal</a>

The reason we say this is simply because of the fact that, while their beginnings were humble, they weren't as humble as some others have been over the years. It took a Swedish investor and several small local airlines joining forces to create this airline. The advantages of the net results of existing assets gave way to unheard of benefits. They were able to get up and going relatively quickly due in part to the pooled assets of existing airlines, combined with established infrastructures. The airline has been largely successful in it's endeavors making it easy to see that it's beginnings were not of a fluke nature.<br /><br />It only makes sense for Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to form the partnership that created SAS. WW 2 ended between May and August of 1945, depending on the location. SAS was formed on 1 August 1946 and begin service 17 September 1946. The era after the end of WW II heralded a new beginning for countries all around the world and, therefore, an association such as that between the airlines of these three countries would not be unexpected. 17 September 1946 marks the beginning of operations for the newly founded SAS. The Swedish flag carrier AB Aerotransport joined SAS in 1948 and the companies merged and created the SAS Consortium in 1951. Each country, after the Consortium was formed and shares were allotted, divided their respective ownership interest half and half with private investors and their governments. A huge part of the success for any airline is brand awareness and marketing. The marketing strategies of Scandinavian airlines during the 1950's created a widely known coup in brand awareness worldwide. Scandinavian Airlines plotted out a route over the North Pole with a maiden voyage to Los Angeles California on the western coast of the United States. Then they took a leap of faith and branded this service as &quot;round the world service over the North Pole to the US.&quot; The destinations serviced by that exact route included Denmark, Alaska and Japan.<br /><br />We are not shy about discussing the smart moves SAS has made over the last several decades. But let's not forget about code sharing agreements with non-alliance airlines. What is meant by this code sharing is that two airlines are legally agreeing to help one another out. What this means for travelers is a broader availability of flights they can use to get to their destination and revenue sharing between companies depending on who holds the ticket. Among those airlines with agreements such as these with SAS are United Airlines, Austrian and Lufthansa airlines. Another common aspect of code sharing is schedule integration so there are no issues with catching connections. During the first decade of the 21st century SAS has really identified itself as a world class airline carrier. The efforts of this company to build strong bonds in business relationships can be said to be the reason for it's overall successful business practices. The company is aggressive and has been all throughout their history. However, they merge and otherwise form different kinds of partnerships whenever necessary. This is big business, and things are what they are, but SAS has weathered the tough aviation storm since the mid 1940s. There have been several instrumental figures in the life of SAS who have helped make the company financially stronger.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheapromanticgetaways55.blog.com%2F2011%2F09%2F21%2Fthe-transformation-and-evolution-of-scandinavian-airlines%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cheapromanticgetaways55.blog.com/2011/09/21/the-transformation-and-evolution-of-scandinavian-airlines/</a>

The people that initially started this company were able to present passenger air carrier resources that are not usually available. This company then went on using decisive and intelligent business decisions to become who they are today. A combo of wisdom, experience, and aviation know-how were the underlying factors that brought them profit early on. Doing well, especially for this company, was a mix of difficult choices and a vision that was never forgotten. Scandinavian Airlines, and what it has achieved, is the focus of this article.<br /><br />It only makes sense for Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to form the partnership that created SAS. The date of birth for the company is August 1, 1946, and merely one year after the end of the second world war. This period was a new beginning for Europe and the world, so in that spirit such an alliance would be expected. After the formation in August of 1946, actual flights were launched on 17 September 1946. The SAS Consortium was put together as a result of other airlines merging with SAS in the 1950s. Each country, after the Consortium was formed and shares were allotted, divided their respective ownership interest half and half with private investors and their governments. <br /><br />In 1997, another smart business by Scandinavian Airlines took place. The airlines, along with Lufthansa, United Airlines, Thai Airways and Air Canada created a network known as the Star Alliance.<br /><br />A long term approach by this group of international airlines is how the alliance came about. Subsequently, in 2001, there was a huge reformation resulting in SAS ownership being divided up among three Scandinavian countries, plus public ownership via stocks. The three countries that are entailed are Sweden, Norway and Denmark. However the businesses shareholdings of public stocks remain at 50%.<br /><br />SAS at the present maintains its heritage as a worldwide air carrier. Two of the long-distance destinations of SAS are to Asia and North America. A majority of the international travel for SAS originates from Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark, their two main hubs. Scandinavian Airlines International-SAS is the division that handles all intercontinental routes along with any sales units outside Scandinavia. They employ almost 1,000 people. The European Traffic Divisions of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway operate independently from the Scandinavian Airlines International-SAS Division. <br /><br />Scandinavian Airlines, or SAS, is an international airline with major hubs in Scandinavia and Europe. This is a fascinating illustration of a large airline which has ownership through public stock and is also co-owned by three separate countries. Bringing flight routes up-to-date was shown to be worthwhile, during the beginning years of SAS. The airline had the ability to collect a large amount of public responsiveness when they made a courageous move to initiate new air routes.<br /><br />A good deal of the achievements made by the company came about because of the predictions the management had during the end of the 20th century.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fboblynn24.womenblog.us%2FThe-first-blog-b1%2FThe-Storied-History-of-Scandinavian-Airlines-b1-p6.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://boblynn24.womenblog.us/The-first-blog-b1/The-Storied-History-of-Scandinavian-Airlines-b1-p6.htm</a>

In the next few paragraphs, the legacy of Scandinavian Airlines will be detailed.<br /><br />In the middle of the 1950s, Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) took off. Scandinavian Airline Systems was the earliest company to venture on a trans-polar flight.<br /><br />This indicates that they flew across the uppermost part of the globe - the North Pole. With the final destination being Los Angeles, California, the bona fide flight was set in motion in Copenhagen, Denmark. Essentially, for SAS this was a rather intelligent move on their part. The rationalization is that they got a large amount of recognition and business out of the movie industry in Hollywood. With that incident, there became a more convenient route from the US west coast to Europe. In the mid 2000's, SAS redesigned itself into four different but related companies. Sweden, along with the other two countries, Denmark and Norway, combined with SAS international, is the result of this new company design.

Their beginnings were humble, sure, but not as humble as some other airlines over the last several years which is why we can say this. The airlines took shape when small, local airlines with Scandinavia put their forces together along with a Swedish investment partner. This resulted in assets creating advantages that other companies didn't have. Unlike others, they were able to take off fairly quickly in part as a result of these pooled resources, assets and preexisting airline infrastructures. Their beginning was of course, not a fluke, as we can see by their overall success.<br /><br />By analyzing the financials we can see that 2006 was a lucrative year for SAS yielding more than 40 billion Swedish Krona, or SEK. During 2006, SAS carried just over 25 million passengers to domestic and international destinations around the world. This one stat put the company on the top 10 list of airlines in Europe with a standing of #9. Much of that success can be chalked up to great moves in the mergers and acquisitions departments of SAS. Among other things, they are a founding member of the aviation consortium known as the Star Alliance Group. SAS was willing to join forces with many other airlines in the past 50 plus years, and that strategy has paid off. A huge part of the success for any airline is brand awareness and marketing. The marketing strategies of Scandinavian airlines during the 1950's created a widely known coup in brand awareness worldwide. A route of air travel flying over the North Pole and ending up on the west coast of the US in Los Angeles California was discovered as they began finding routes to operate in. This route allowed them to take advantage of a huge branding opportunity, coining the &quot;round the world service over the North Pole&quot; phrasing. The destinations serviced by that exact route included Denmark, Alaska and Japan.<br /><br />It's no secret that SAS has joined many smart alliances over the years. However, it's important that we not forget about the code sharing agreements with other airlines as well. This simply means a legally binding agreement is created between two airlines to the benefit of each. Passengers are allowed to fly on each of the airlines with revenues to be passed or shared to the parent company ticket holder. SAS maintains agreements such as these with Lufthansa, Austrian and United airlines. Another common aspect of code sharing is schedule integration so there are no issues with catching connections. During the first decade of the 21st century SAS has really identified itself as a world class airline carrier. This is mostly due to the smart business choices and partnership opportunities they have seized. The company is aggressive and has been all throughout their history. For the good of the company however, they aren't afraid to enter into agreements and partnerships that will benefit the company and it's consumers. SAS has weathered some pretty tough storms since the mid 1940's and yet they have persevered year after year. It is important that we recognize the importance of the roles of some key figures in the life and survival of SAS who helped the company achieve and maintain financial stability.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcheapromanticweekendgetaways02.qapacity.com.qapacity.com%2Fmy-blog%2F77702%2Finnovation-and-expansion-of-scandinavian-airlines-during-the-twentieth-century%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://cheapromanticweekendgetaways02.qapacity.com.qapacity.com/my-blog/77702/innovation-and-expansion-of-scandinavian-airlines-during-the-twentieth-century/</a>

There was a huge reorganization of the structure in 2001, which resulted in SAS ownership being divvied up among three Scandinavian countries, as well as stock offerings for public ownership. Sweden, Denmark and Norway are the three countries that are mixed up in this. Yet the shareholding of public stocks by the company stays at 50%.<br /><br />Increased security were massive in the 2000's because of the 9/11 attaches and terrorist threats around the world. To augment and bolster existing security measures the Swedish division of SAS implemented a biometric fingerprint identification system. Swedish SAS instituted this particular system to be used within Sweden. This biometric system is used to make a positive match between luggage and the person who owns it. SAS Norway uses the biometric system since 2006. There are impressive logistical concerns that Scandinavian Airlines faces since it is owned across three separate countries. Since it began, and to this day, this airline continues to operate in the same exact manner. SAS uses this to its advantage allowing it to continue now and into the future. And finally, this company has been given many business opportunities that keep it financially secure.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ryze.com%2Fed.a%3Feventid%3D101940"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryze.com/ed.a?eventid=101940</a>

The reason we say this is simply because of the fact that, while their beginnings were humble, they weren't as humble as some others have been over the years. Local airlines in Scandinavia joining forces with Swedish investors was the beginning of the Scandinavian Airlines endeavor. The net result from that brought existing assets to the company which meant they had certain advantages. Due to the already established infrastructures of the existing airlines and their pooled assets and resources, this airline was able to quickly get moving. The airline has been largely successful in it's endeavors making it easy to see that it's beginnings were not of a fluke nature.<br /><br />The year 2006 yielded 42 billion Swedish Krona, or SEK for SAS. Over 25 million domestic and international travelers were transported in that one year alone. As far as the top 10 in Europe for 2006, the statistics put them at #9 on that list. A big portion of this success was attributed to smart mergers and acquisitions for SAS. Besides, they are also among the founding members of the Star Alliance Group of aviation consortiums. SAS has used a strategy of joining forces with other airlines over the last 50 years which has definitely paid off for them. One of the biggest keys to a successful airline is brand awareness and marketing prowess. The marketing strategies of Scandinavian airlines during the 1950's created a widely known coup in brand awareness worldwide. A route of air travel flying over the North Pole and ending up on the west coast of the US in Los Angeles California was discovered as they began finding routes to operate in. This route allowed them to take advantage of a huge branding opportunity, coining the &quot;round the world service over the North Pole&quot; phrasing. This flight service included destinations such as Anchorage, Alaska; Copenhagen and Tokyo, Japan.<br /><br />The terrorist threats around the world and the 9/11 attaches resulted in increased security. In 2006, the Swedish division of SAS implemented a biometric fingerprint identification system to enlarge and bolster existing security measures. Swedish SAS instituted this particular system to be used within Sweden. This biometric system is used to make a positive match between luggage and the person who owns it. SAS Norway has started using this system, but makes it very clear to passengers that it is strictly voluntary. <br /><br />Each service area represents a different division within Scandinavian Airlines. From the start, Scandinavian Airlines functioned mostly as an alliance among the different airlines and its investors. In time, however, the airlines that were part of the alliance, merged with the SAS conglomerate. The different divisions of SAS in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway now employ almost 16,000 people.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyanimelist.net%2Fblog.php%3Feid%3D155567"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=155567</a>
