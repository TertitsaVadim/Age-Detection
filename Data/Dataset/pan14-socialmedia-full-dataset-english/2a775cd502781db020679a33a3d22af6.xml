Filmmakers are pushing the complexity and overall look of the urban genre to new levels. <br /><br />Exploring the urban landscape and culture makes for entertaining films that offer viewers a look into a slice of americana they might not otherwise experience. Collaborating with dedicated individuals that work in front of the camera and behind the scenes to create quality urban movies has always been a life goal of Director Sid Kali. <br /><br />Sid Kali made his directorial debut with the urban feature &quot;Consignment&quot;. The spirit of independent filmmaking came together. We felt &quot;Consignment&quot; was best served highlighting a Latino and Black perspective of the events that were going to unfold in the film. <br /><br />The plot centers around a Virginia Beach drug dealer that runs into trouble and has to lay low in Southern California. This being the movies all the problems that come with power, drug money, fast women, and jealous rivals has to come out. It was nice to be able to mix in the subtle cultural differences between the two places. <br /><br />This West Coast and East Coast mix worked out because Co-Producer and Editor Tim Beachum had lived in Ohio, Detroit , and Virginia Beach during his years. While Sid Kali has only lived in Southern California his entire life. By working together they were able to blend these influences together. &quot;Consignment&quot; is being released on DVD November 2007 by Maverick Entertainment Group, Inc. Support independent film and add this feature to your DVD collection. <br /><br />An important aspect of making an urban movie is keeping it authentic. At the independent level budgets are tighter, so it helps if you write a script that has elements you can realistically translate from the page to the screen. The basic idea is to write a script that you can shoot using your resources. The cool thing with urban movies are they lend themselves to many more backdrops than before. <br /><br />It used to be when you attached the word urban to a film the story had to take place in the inner city. That's changing as urban culture and style is moving beyond those pervious boundaries. This makes for an exciting time to shoot urban movies. <br /><br />The word &quot;crime drama&quot; is used to describe films like &quot;Training Day&quot;, &quot;The Departed&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; and 'Scarface'. To some movie buffs these are urban masterpieces done by highly talented and respected filmmakers at the top of their creative game. This shows the diversity of the urban genre. <br /><br />After the experience of shooting &quot;Consignment&quot;. Slice Of Americana Films wanted to expand their take on the urban genre with &quot;In With Thieves&quot;. This urban movie brings together a unique blend of creative elements. <br /><br />&quot;In With Thieves&quot; features a Cuban cartel that practices their own version of Santeria, an African based crime group that deals in blood diamonds, ruthless Albanian gangsters, and an American burglary crew that is Latino, Black, and Irish. <br /><br />This unique blend of creative and visual elements we felt would make for a provocative urban film. The inspiration was to show that urban stories can have global influences. <br /><br />Whatever happens keep the show rolling.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">DVD Walking Dead</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Your Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Find Films</a>

Real holiday hideaways very often are only accessible by boat, and as you cross the channel to Mayreau you will realise, if you didn’t before what a small island it is.<br /><br />Mayreau in fact is the smallest inhabited island in the Grenadines, being less than two square miles in size, with a population of about 250 living in a village on the south west of the island. Saltwhistle Bay Resort occupies the entire northern end of Mayreau island and the unspoilt beach shore of the windward side, which is considered by many windsurfers and kite boarders to be world class. Another reason for basing yourself here is that the famous, beautiful Tobago Cays are no distance away at all.<br /><br />You will be greeted with a tray of rum punch, and your luggage will disappear, to reappear again in your bedroom, one of just ten rooms in stone cottages, scattered around behind a screen of palm trees in a 22 acre tropical garden. This is a simple and definitely barefoot type of place, but don’t be misled because it is also extremely comfortable but very low key. The cottages at Saltwhistle bay have been built using local wood and stone, and all feature king sized beds, with a spacious bed sitting area with an ensuite bathroom. Accessible from each room is a semi private shaded and furnished roof terrace.<br /><br />It has to be described as a real Caribbean Hideaway because it is at least two plane journeys and a boat ride from home, so it is isolated. There is a little activity but not much, and the people who come here, do so to escape the speed and noise of life in the twenty first century. Most people who come to this Caribbean island resort come to read, relax, swing in a hammock and just generally enjoy the natural tropical life of a totally undeveloped tropical paradise. The bay is a perfect half moon of white sand and turquoise blue water, and must be one of the very best in the Caribbean<br /><br />To summarise the key features of Saltwhistle Bay.<br /><br />This is a very remote small Grenadines Hotel set on the smallest inhabited Grenadines Island of Mayreau, with a bar which can be lively with visiting yachtsmen, and an excellent stone and palm thatched garden restaurant which presents three good meals every day. It is an intimate, friendly hotel on a romantic Caribbean beach, with good swimming. Not only that you can spend an afternoon on Petite Tobaque which is where Johnny Depp was marooned in the movie ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’.<br /><br />The second thing is that you should visit the village on the other side of Mayreau where you will be able to eat some very good food at great value prices.<br /><br />This Caribbean Island resort will not be for you if you like five star pampering but if you see yourself as a traveller as opposed to a holidaymaker then this Caribbean Hideaway could be perfect.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Depp Moves</a>

This is a highly emotional time for him, and is a particularly good time for creativity in artistic endeavors. It is a cycle of frequent sudden or unusual endings for him in his work and relationships.<br /><br />This is seen in his several romantic attachments in the early years of this cycle before he met his current girlfriend French singer-actress Vanessa Paradis. Also, his several run ins with the law fit into this pattern.<br /><br />The challenge of this cycle is for him to overcome a reluctance to accept his great personal power, and to avoid becoming greedy. I would say that so far, Johnny Depp has successfully lived up to that challenge. With his next Life Cycle 13 years in the future, we're in the midst of a long period of creative success for him.<br /><br />===&gt; His Transit Letters<br /><br />Transit letters are calculated from a person's full birth name and are the most detailed predictor of events unique to an individual. Johnny Depp, being born a 3rd, ('III' on his birth certificate,) has the unique trait of always having an 'I' transit letter in affect throughout his life.<br /><br />His transit letter of 'I' marks a time of dramatic ups and downs in his life, a time filled with creative opportunities. Remember this is in affect for him all the years of his life, except when a double 'I' is in affect (such as occurred for him in 1983 through 1991). In those years he would have great difficulties getting things started in his life. Fortunately, that period is long passed.<br /><br />His other current Letters of transit are 'OPP'. They begin on his 41st birthday in June 2004, and will end on his 45th birthday in June 2008. Their affects on his life are as follows:<br /><br />His transit letter of `O' marks a time of calm and serenity in his life. He will accept responsibilities in his home life and experience improved finances during this period. I believe this indicates that he has found a balance in his family life, and that his film work will continue to bring huge success. The 'O' transit letter will stay in force through the end of this decade, so his career looks bright indeed.<br /><br />His transit letters of `PP' mark a time of too much privacy and solitude in his life. He tends to live like a hermit. This period of intense privacy will end in June 2008 when the double 'P' changes to a 'P' and an 'H'.<br /><br />Following up, his transit letter of 'P' in June 2008 will mark a time when Depp still needs solitude, but not to the degree of the last few years. It also marks an excellent time for business and financial growth.<br /><br />And his future transit letter of 'H' will mark a time of professional growth, financial success, and independence. He should be careful to pace himself and not overwork.<br /><br />===&gt; His Personal Year<br /><br />2006 is a personal year (5) for Johnny Depp; a time in which new opportunities abound. He will feel change in the very air. New people or interest will come into his life. Depp's adaptability to changes in his life is enhanced. A fitting image for a Pirate, seeing everything he touches turn to Gold.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qb2hubnlkZXBwZmlsbXMuY29t" target="_blank">Depp Mania</a>

		<document id="c5af0fdd7b959eea9f6ac0ff840e6a31" url=""><![CDATA[Look Into Walking Dead.<br/><br/>Old Yeller, perhaps one of the biggest tear jerker movies of all time, is a well loved classic adapted from the 1956 novel. This is the story about a family in the antebellum south. The father is away trying to earn money. Old Yeller is a stray dog who befriends the family and even defends them from a rabid wolf. This movie is popular among adults and children alike. This is the first movie that focused on the love between a boy and his dog, and it spurned many other films and books with a similar theme. <br /><br />Homeward Bound: the Incredible Journey is a great family movie. This 1993 film is a remake of the lesser known 1963 film The Incredible Journey. Homeward Bound is about the journey of two dogs and a cat as they make their way home. The animal personalities rule the film. Chance, the American Bulldog, is a scrappy wanderer who tries to put out an air of not needing anyone. Shadow, the loyal and older Golden Retriever is a caring soul who watches out for the other two animals. Sassy, the long haired cat, is a prissy, pampered pet who longs to return to the comforts of home. Together these three have funny adventures as well as heart rending ones in their journey to find their loved ones. This movie helped to establish the idea of animals having individual personalities as many pet owners will attest to. <br /><br />Marley and Me, the newest film on this list, is guaranteed to be a classic. Based upon the book by John Grogan, this film depicts the lovable but worst dog ever, Marley. Marley gets into disaster after disaster from tearing his home apart to shaking in his boots at every thunderstorm that rolls across Florida. Marely and Me depicts the life of Marely from puppyhood up to old age and the journey he has with his family along the way. The love for a dog that never seems to do the right thing is one that many pet owners will connect with. <br /><br />Best in Show, the 2000 mockumentary about contestants in a dog show, is a hilarious look into the world of dogs and their owners. This movie is more about the people who love their dogs than about the dogs, but dog owners everywhere will love it anyway. There are five dogs featured in the film: a Norwich terrier, a Bloodhound, a Weimaraner, a Shih-Tzu, and a Poodle. These dogs represent pretty common entrants into dog shows. Their owners back stories, however, are what really brings personality to the film from the over-obsessive yuppy pet parents to the Weimaraner to the quirky owners of the Norwich terrier. <br /><br />Benji, a classic dog movie from the 1970’s, is a great one for anyone who has ever adopted a stray, mixed dog. This movie includes as a great mystery as Benji works to save two children who have been kidnapped. This film is guaranteed to be loved by the whole family as much as Benji, the stray dog, is loved by so many people in his town. Benji was such a popular dog character that his character was reprised for additional films all the way up to 2004, thirty years after the first Benji film debuted.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Click For Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Your Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">DVD Walking Dead</a>

What better way to create lasting ones than to gather the whole family around to watch some great classic Christmas movies? <br /><br />Many movies come to mind, but following are the three considered by many to be the best. <br /><br />1) It’s A Wonderful Life(1946): James(Jimmy) Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore <br /><br />George Bailey(Jimmy Stewart) is considering ending it all to escape all the problems in his life—on Christmas! Just as he is about to jump off a bridge, he’s interrupted by Clarence, his guardian angel(Henry Travers). To convince George not to go through with it, Clarence shows him what life would be like without him. <br /><br />Did you just hear that bell ring? An angel just got his wings. <br /><br />2) Miracle On 34th Street(1947): Edmund Gwenn, Maureen O’Hara, John Payne, Gene Lockhart, Natalie Wood <br /><br />When nice, old Kris Kringle(Edmund Gwenn) claims to be the real Santa and is put in an insane asylum, Fred Gailey(John Payne) decides to represent him in court. In a hearing that tests the people’s beliefs, Kris is found to be the real Santa. <br /><br />Yes, Susan(Natalie Wood), there is a Santa Claus. <br /><br />3) Scrooge(1951): Alastair Sim, Mervyn Jones, Michael Hordern <br /><br />Everybody knows the story of Ebenezer Scrooge. But, even with all the different versions of “A Christmas Carol,” over the years, none have given a better performance than Alastair Sim. It’s as if he was born to play the stingy, hard-hearted Scrooge. Sim is the embodiment of what Charles Dickens had in mind. <br /><br />I think I’ll go buy the biggest goose in all of London. <br /><br />Now go rent these three all-time classic Christmas movies, make some hot chocolate, gather the family around the TV and start making some classic Christmas movie memories. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Click For Films</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Find Films</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">Movie Here</a>

It may not be my fiancées favorite pastime, but he is generally a good sport about it. He may not admit it, but he can recite certain scenes from My Best Friend's Wedding off the top of his head. Quite a few excellent wedding movies have been released in the last couple years, and these are some of my favorites.<br /><br />Meet the Parents has become one of my all-time faves. It was released back in 2000, and stars the ever-so-funny Ben Stiller. The premise is typical of many wedding movies; a nervous young man is introduced to his future in-laws. What makes this movie so excitingly funny is the role of prospective Father-in-Law, played by Robert DeNiro. The dynamic that plays out between Stiller and DeNiro is unforgettable. Oh, the hilarity of it all!<br /><br />Meet the Fockers is a sequel to the above mentioned, and was released in 2004. This time around we have the pleasure of meeting the parents of Ben Stiller's character, Greg Focker. His parents are played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand, both of whom deliver unforgettable roles. They stand in stark contrast to the bride's parents from the previous film. While the bride's parents are somewhat conservative and stuffy, the parents of the groom are new-age leftists. These two films have become my all-time favorite wedding movies. Sooo funny!<br /><br />The Corpse Bride is another highly entertaining movie with a wedding theme. This animated masterpiece was released to critical acclaim in 2005. It is quirky in the way that all Tim Burton films are, and it has some of my favorite stars doing voice-over work. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter play the lead roles. The premise goes something like this; a young man is having difficulty with his lines during his wedding rehearsal. He strays off into the forest to practice alone. He nails his lines perfectly, and places the ring on a fallen tree branch…or so he thinks. It turns out that the fallen tree branch was actually the decrepit finger of the Corpse Bride, who has risen from the dead and claims to be his legal bride.

The vehicle data is updated every 2 – 15 minutes, depending upon the owner’s preferences and manufacturer’s settings.<br /><br />The central server makes the tracking data available to the system owner through the Internet. The owner logs onto the tracking company’s secure web server and sees their vehicle data on a map and in text form. Some tracking companies make the data available for download, so the owner could archive it on their own computer.<br /><br />Why do they use it?<br /><br />Users of GPS tracking systems have many reasons why they’ve installed them:<br /><br />1. Tracking systems reduce vehicle costs by targeting speeding employees, who waste fuel, cause excessive engine wear and ultimately, drive up insurance rates.<br /><br />2. Using the system's automatic mileage reminder reduces downtime and enhances vehicle resale values by encouraging scheduled, preventative maintenance. Your tracking system will remind you when it's time to rotate tires, change oil or perform other scheduled maintenance.<br /><br />3. Many insurance companies offer discounts of up to 30% for vehicles protected with tracking systems.<br /><br />4. Productivity is improved by:<br /><br />a. documenting long lunch hours,<br /><br />b. exposing unauthorized breaks,<br /><br />c. comparing driver overtime requests with system reports of driver activity,<br /><br />d. logging personal vehicle use after hours or on weekends.<br /><br />5. GPS tracking systems improve customer service by showing you which employee is closest to the client who just called. WOW your customers--give them precise arrival or delivery estimates, based upon the actual location of your vehicles at the moment they call.<br /><br />6. Your system can tell you the exact time and date each employee reached each customer. If a customer questions when your employee arrived or left --prove it to them.<br /><br />7. Is one employee more productive than another? --Check the data. Is it time to add a vehicle? --Use your system and there's no more guessing.<br /><br />8. Use your system to correlate overtime performed with your employees' overtime requests. See who is putting in extra time.<br /><br />9. Never make another phone call to find out where your employees say they are.<br /><br />10. Simplify asset management by displaying everything on one computer screen. Make work easier for your dispatcher.<br /><br />11. Tracking systems work without any input from the driver. No driver logs needed.<br /><br />Purchasers of GPS vehicle tracking systems say they recover their investment in an average of six – 12 months, by both reducing expenses and improving productivity. While some users recoup their entire investment at one time by recovering a stolen vehicle, most users are repaid more gradually.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FzcGlyZS1zeXN0ZW1zLmNvbS9jYWxsLWxvZ2dpbmcv" target="_blank">Click For Phone Logging</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FzcGlyZS1zeXN0ZW1zLmNvbS9vYWstcmVwb3J0LWNhbGwtbG9nZ2luZy1wcmVtaXVtLw__" target="_blank">Click Here</a>

Well, the reason for this is that when women follow their hearts and not their heads during dating, the way that they act around men is not always in their own best interests. You can't expect to treat a man like you would treat a girlfriend if you want to make him crazy about you. Whether or not you agree, here are 5 dating rules that you must not break if you want to succeed at dating: <br /><br />Rule #1 - Don't get Attached Too Quickly <br /><br />He's gorgeous and cute on the surface but take your time and get to know the real person before you allow yourself to attach to him. This will save you a lot of heartbreak and disappointment when you find out he's not the man you thought he was or he was never really looking for a relationship. If you take some time to find out who he is first, you can eliminate the bad ones quickly and find yourself a top quality man. <br /><br />Rule #2 - Don't Pressurise or Chase <br /><br />OK, so this one seems unfair. Why should we have to sit back and wait while we let the man do the chasing? The reason is that chasing a man generally does not work in the long-term. A man will generally resist any pressure that you put on him and you could find yourself in a battle. Generally, pursuit is in the genes of a man. If you make it easy for him, he will not find you half as interesting as if you present a challenge. He might be flattered at first, but he will lose interest quickly. Don't believe me? Next time you are dating, try holding back just a little bit and see how much it sparks his interest. <br /><br />Rule #3 - Don't Expect Too Much Too Soon <br /><br />Don't think that you are in a relationship just because you've had a few dates or he seems really into you. When we feel close to someone it is easy for us to open up and spill everything out about what has gone wrong in our lives and relationships. When you first meet a man, resist the urge to tell him anything that he might interpret negatively. It is easy to put a man off with tales of past boyfriends or premature confessions, so be on your guard and save these for when your relationship is stronger. <br /><br />Rule #5 - Don't Sleep With Him Straight Away <br /><br />OK, so you don't like this one either, but it's a fact. When you sleep with a man, you will start to become attached to him, even before you have established that he is a suitable partner. Now that you are attached to him, you will have expectations of a relationship. You have presented yourself as easy prey and the challenge is over for him before it begins. You have already broken most of these dating rules. Yes, he will happily sleep with you, although now he is more likely to see you as someone to have sex with rather than someone to have a relationship with. When you don't give into your urges to break these rules, you will be able succeed at dating.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL09hc2lz" target="_blank">Dating In Manchester</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9NYW5jaGVzdGVy" target="_blank">Start Dating</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">Dating Online</a>

In this age and time, it is pretty typical for men to go after the young, nubile ones because it has long been socially acceptable. The idea of a man dating an older woman is yet to be accepted, although it is fast becoming a new trend. After all, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore got married, right? Women who date younger men said they appreciated the strength, humour, openness, youth and passion of their partners. <br /><br />But what do the men get? It could be her air of mystery; or perhaps because of her maturity and independence in terms of money. Some men also prefer being with somebody older because they can be better lovers, with lots of experience under their belt, and they usually don’t play mind games unlike their younger counterparts. There are a lot of pros, as well as cons in dating an older woman. Let’s take a look at it one by one: First, let’s tackle the differences between an average twenty year old woman and one in her early or mid-thirties. <br /><br />The twenty year-old woman is active, determined and always bent on getting things done. The one in her thirties (and older) has obviously lived a bit more. She has probably learned a lot of lessons in life the hard way, and she’s less likely to be passionate about seemingly insignificant things, like going to dance clubs every Saturday night and get wasted. This can be a life-changing experience for a man in his mid-twenties because with an older gal, he can be laid back and have a peace of mind. Men are hopelessly clueless as to what a woman really wants. <br /><br />This is where the experience of somebody older plays a major role. A woman several years your senior has been there before, so she has already learned not to waste precious time waiting for you to sweep her off her feet. Instead, she knows just what it is that she wants and will even manipulate you physically and mentally to get it. A woman in this particular age group is more likely to have an established career and is more financially secure. She relies less on somebody to support her, which is a strong stress reliever for any man. Moreover, one doesn’t have to worry about going out with young gold diggers who are only after the money. <br /><br />However, keep in mind that these gold-diggers do become old gold-diggers, so keep a close watch on your wallet. Another advantage of dating older women is being able to have stimulating conversations about anything under the sun. Also, they know how to value the truer things in life. Unlike their young counterparts, they have learned not to play head games anymore and have less materialistic ideals. And, most importantly, a man doesn’t have to endure senseless topics like what shade of lipstick matches her eyes, and whether her pants make her butt look big. Be sure to do a credit personality check with her, so that you’ll have an idea of just how much past baggages she’s carrying with her.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9CaXJtaW5naGFt" target="_blank">Click Now</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9Mb25kb24_" target="_blank">Dating In London</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbGlja2luZ3RvZ2V0aGVyLmNvbS9PbmxpbmVfRGF0aW5nL0ZpbmRfTG92ZV9Jbl9MZWVkcw__" target="_blank">Dating UK</a>

		<document id="b20fa944fbf27f7336aae5ae9239e7ce" url=""><![CDATA[Take A Look At Hunger Games.<br/><br/>To understand that, it is necessray to know the ay in which P2P software operates, and what the differences are between P2P legal downloads and bootleg movies. When P2P site members download movies they are copying the file from another member's hard disk. If you are searching for a particular movie, you will be given a list of those available and normally how many online computers have that movie on their hard disk. <br /><br />When downloading, you can be simultaneously downloading from the hard disk of several online members of the site. Napster porvided a hub in the form of a central server, through which all downloads were passed between the provider ansd receiver of the files. Due to that way of working, Napster was found responsible for downloads made using their site since they were, in effect, acting as an intermediary to the crime by passing the illegal downloads from one person to the other. <br /><br />Modern free on line movies pass through no central hub, but are downloaded by means of a direct comnection to the provider's hard drive. You are downloading directly from the hard drive of the computer providing the file - the link is one to one. Because it is software driven, no liability for the way people use it can be laid at the door of those that sell it. <br /><br />That is why the music and movie moguls were so annoyed and upset: the believed the problem to have been dealt with when Napster had been successfully convicted. However, they got it wrong and found that instead of targeting just a few software firms, they faced the task of chasing the many millions of ordinary people that were downloading copyrighted material every day. <br /><br />So when is downloading illegal and when is it legal? What is the differenbce between a bootleg movie and a PSP legal download? Very simple to answer, but very difficult to understand. Fundamentally, no work that is copyright-protected can be downloaded or copied with the express permission of the owner of the work. You can be sure that all of the online music, games and movies are copyright-protected unles the owners have licensed them for downloading without permission. <br /><br />Many do allow it. Particularly new artists or amateur movie-makers wanting to get their name known and their work publicized free of charge, or professionals testing the water for a new album or film idea. Most don't, and if you try to understand the copyright law, particularly in the USA, it is very murky indeed. In the UK, the law with regard to movies is fairly easy to understand: movies are copyrighted ro 70 years after the death of the last main director, composer or writer and music for 50 years after it was released. <br /><br />The situation has been made even more complex in America by the Sony Bono Law, and it looks like no music at is free of copyright restrictions any more, and that movies are going to be covered as well for many years to come unless, possibly, they were made before 1923. As I said - complicated. Given the number of people that use P2P sites, this is not likely, but why take the risk if you don't have to? <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM0OS1kZWFkLXdhbGtpbmc_" target="_blank">Click Here</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9sYXRlc3QtcmV2aWV3cy1vZi1tb3ZpZXM_" target="_blank">Your Movies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdGFyYnVyc3RtYWdhemluZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvMzM1MC1nYW1lcy1odW5nZXItZHZk" target="_blank">Hunger Games</a>

This is the story about a family in the antebellum south. The father is away trying to earn money. Old Yeller is a stray dog who befriends the family and even defends them from a rabid wolf. This movie is popular among adults and children alike. This is the first movie that focused on the love between a boy and his dog, and it spurned many other films and books with a similar theme. <br /><br />Homeward Bound: the Incredible Journey is a great family movie. This 1993 film is a remake of the lesser known 1963 film The Incredible Journey. The animal personalities rule the film. Chance, the American Bulldog, is a scrappy wanderer who tries to put out an air of not needing anyone. Shadow, the loyal and older Golden Retriever is a caring soul who watches out for the other two animals. Sassy, the long haired cat, is a prissy, pampered pet who longs to return to the comforts of home. Together these three have funny adventures as well as heart rending ones in their journey to find their loved ones. This movie helped to establish the idea of animals having individual personalities as many pet owners will attest to. <br /><br />Marley and Me, the newest film on this list, is guaranteed to be a classic. Based upon the book by John Grogan, this film depicts the lovable but worst dog ever, Marley. Marley gets into disaster after disaster from tearing his home apart to shaking in his boots at every thunderstorm that rolls across Florida. Marely and Me depicts the life of Marely from puppyhood up to old age and the journey he has with his family along the way. The love for a dog that never seems to do the right thing is one that many pet owners will connect with. <br /><br />Best in Show, the 2000 mockumentary about contestants in a dog show, is a hilarious look into the world of dogs and their owners. This movie is more about the people who love their dogs than about the dogs, but dog owners everywhere will love it anyway. There are five dogs featured in the film: a Norwich terrier, a Bloodhound, a Weimaraner, a Shih-Tzu, and a Poodle. These dogs represent pretty common entrants into dog shows. Their owners back stories, however, are what really brings personality to the film from the over-obsessive yuppy pet parents to the Weimaraner to the quirky owners of the Norwich terrier. <br /><br />Benji, a classic dog movie from the 1970’s, is a great one for anyone who has ever adopted a stray, mixed dog. This movie includes as a great mystery as Benji works to save two children who have been kidnapped. This film is guaranteed to be loved by the whole family as much as Benji, the stray dog, is loved by so many people in his town. Benji was such a popular dog character that his character was reprised for additional films all the way up to 2004, thirty years after the first Benji film debuted.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d5Zm9wZWRpYS5vcmcudWsvaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPUNoZWNrLU91dC1IdW5nZXItR2FtZXMhLi4_" target="_blank">Check Out Hunger Games...</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3dpa2kuZ2Vla3NwaG9uZS5jb20vZW4vaW5kZXgucGhwP3RpdGxlPUxldHMtTG9vay1BdC1IdW5nZXItR2FtZXMuLi4_" target="_blank">Check Out Hunger Games!!</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kbWxpLm9yZy93aWtpL2luZGV4LnBocD90aXRsZT1HZXQtU29tZS1XYWxraW5nLURlYWQhLi4_" target="_blank">Look Into Movie Reviews!..</a>

Over the years, the suspicion felt by many have not dissipated. Rather, it has intensified as technology continued to develop.

Various industries use this method as a means to safeguard company interests and track information coming in and out.<br /><br />For instance, call centre companies use it as a means to track worker performance in handling client inquiries and requests. It also doubles as a teaching device for their new employees as these people get to listen to actual calls made in the past.<br /><br />Prisons may also use it as a way to monitor conversations between inmates and their guests for added security measures. If this were not present, riots or assassination plots may occur undetected since convicted inmates know that no one is paying attention.<br /><br />Armed forces and other army units also utilize this process to protect military intelligence gathered.
