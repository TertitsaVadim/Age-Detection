In the previous few years, these and various factors have brought about a significant escalation in the numerous incidents that could be termed as 'maritime frauds'. <br /><br />Categories of Fraud <br /><br />Ocean going fraud has many guises therefore methods are open to infinite variations. Most these crimes could be classified into four categories as underneath: <br /><br />o	Scuttling regarding ships <br /><br />o	Documentary frauds <br /><br />o	Cargo Thefts <br /><br />o	Fraud in connection with the chartering regarding vessels <br /><br />Scuttling associated with Ships <br /><br />Better known as 'rust bucket' ripoffs, this involves prepared sinking of shipwrecks in pursuance with fraud against the two cargo and hull hobbies and interests. With occasional exclusions, these crimes usually are committed by ship-owners in times where a vessel is approaching or gets the end of its economic life, taking into account the age in the vessel, its condition along with the prevailing freight marketplace.

No goods are instead to be furnished or shipped, although the ship-owner agrees to provide bills of lading to point out that the goods have been completely loaded on that vessel. The bills of lading as well as such other documents as are expected are presented to the bank negotiating the letter of credit ratings. The banker pays against documents and not against goods. After ascertaining of the fact that cargo description corresponds to the requirements as stipulated in the L/C, the loan provider, in the normal span of events, releases the funds within the terms of this L/C. <br /><br />Documentary Frauds <br /><br />Any such fraud involves the sale and buy of goods to documentary credit terms and many or the different documents specified by the buyer to be presented through the seller to the bank so that they can receive payment, usually are forged. Bankers spend against documents. The forged documents seek to cover up the fact that the goods go about doing not exist or likely not of the standard ordered by you. When the unfortunate purchaser in the goods belatedly understands that no goods are arriving, your dog starts checking, to find that your alleged carrying vessels either will never exist or had been loading at some other type of port at your relevant time. <br /><br />Banks cope with documents and not with the goods covered by them. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/TwiromxibleyEhollama/blog/blogid=7074424" target="_blank">What Causes Truck Accidents on Highways?</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hbnVlbGdheTkyMy5oeXZlcy5ubC9ibG9nLzQ5Mjc0Mzk3L0xvdWlzaWFuYV9NYXJpdGltZV9MYXd5ZXJzX0hlbHBfVmljdGltc19SZWNvdmVyX01vcmUvUjlVMC8/cGFnZWlkPTY0MTJUTVBHOTFXQ1c4R0tP" target="_blank"> Using an Maritime Lawyer When Dealing With Insurance Companies</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hbnVlbGdheTkyMy53ZWJzaXRld2l6YXJkLmNvbS93aGF0LWNhdXNlcy10cnVjay1hY2NpZGVudHMtb24taGlnaHdheXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Louisiana Maritime Lawyers Help Victims Recover More.</a><br /><br />o	Shipment has to be by well-established shipping charges lines. <br /><br />That fourth way your business interest fights your maritime claim is to use video surveillance.
