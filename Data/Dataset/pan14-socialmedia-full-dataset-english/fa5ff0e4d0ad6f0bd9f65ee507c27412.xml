<br /><br />I want you to know one thing. 
<br />You know how this is: 
<br />if I look at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
<br />of the slow autumm at my window, 
<br />if I touch near the fire the impalpable ash 
<br />or the wrinkled body of the log, 
<br />everything carries me to you, 
<br />as if everything that exists, 
<br />aromas, light, metals 
<br />were little boats that sail 
<br />toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
<br /><br />Well, now, 
<br />if little by little you stop loving me 
<br />I shall stop loving you little by little. 
<br /><br />If suddenly
<br />you forget me do not look for me, 
<br />for I shall already have forgotten you. 
<br />If you think it long and mad, 
<br />the wind of banners 
<br />that passes through my life, 
<br />and you decide to leave me 
<br />at the shore of the heart where I have roots, 
<br />remember that on that day, 
<br />at that hour, 
<br />I shall lift my arms 
<br />and my roots will set off to seek another land. 
<br /><br />But if each day,
<br />each hour, 
<br />you feel that you are 
<br />destined for me with implacable sweetness, 
<br />if each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
<br />ah my love, ah my own, 
<br />in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
<br />my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
<br />and as long as you live 
<br />it will be in your arms without leaving mine.©

We were eating at one of those places downtown with seating outside.  For some reason she wanted to sit outside while we ate.  My thinking is the air inside was bought we might as well use it, and I don't have to hear traffic.  We are facing each other across the table.  I'm gagging down a sandwich that they said mayo would ruin the taste of.  The dry bread ruined the taste you hoity toity bitch.  Anyway we are talking and eating and I'm sipping a green tea because they only serve healthy shit at this fucking place so an Arnold Palmer is out of the question.  GASP!  That has sugar!
<br /><br />As we are in the middle of lunch a man comes up to me from behind and gets my attention.  &quot;Excuse me Miss.&quot;
<br /><br />I turn around to see a very thin man dressed a little too nice for our downtown.  &quot;Yes.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;OH MY GOD!  I am from so-and-so modeling agency.  We have SO been looking for someone like you to be in our ads.&quot;
<br /><br />Well now I start to smile.   All I can reply with is a &quot;Really?&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You are perfect.  Your face, your height, and your body.  I'm hoping we can get shots of you with your Dress off.&quot;
<br /><br />Wait a minute.  Get the fuck out!  Me?  Some girls would of freaked out and took off running.  As for me  I just feel my ego getting boosted.  I keep thinking &quot;Yeah!  That's right.&quot;  Knowing I'm going to have to shoot him down I didn't want to let this play out any longer than it had to so I asked him &quot;Are you sure I'm what you're looking for.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;OH MY GAWD YES!  It is so hard to find a good 'before' model.&quot;
<br /><br />I woke up in the ambulance.  Apparently I passed out choking on my shitty turkey sandwich when he said that.  Eh, the meal was free.

<br />Current mood:  awake 
<br /><br />Well since the phone is ringing every five minutes now at work I decided to cancel my nap.  I'll just write a blog instead.  I'm going to take this time to give my opinion on a few things just to let you know where I stand.
<br /><br /><img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />subject that has been a PAN hot topic as of late is fake profiles.  Truthfully I don't much care.  It sucks for the people that really got sucked in, and thought they had real friends.  Who doesn't use a little fakeness here though.  You can put whatever face forward you want online.  You can hide a fat ass, wife beating habit, unhealthy midget obsessions, or even worse things like being a Cowboys fan.  I don't like that these people stole pictures from elsewhere to pose as themselves.  If you don't want your face seen for whatever reason use an avatar.  Plenty of people do it.  It keeps people from messin with sasquatch.

Also, if you’re going to look for it in the Holy Bible, you’d find a different meaning. I have once attended a mass with the priest preaching that love is sacrifice and all that. And as for some who pretends to know a lot but actually doesn’t, they depend their definition with stupid clichés such as love is blind and other similar oh-cut-the-crap stuff.
<br /><br />And if you ask me, I used to believe that love is a fairytale. There would come a handsome prince living in a castle, trying to rescue me from an evil witch, and then we’ll live happily ever after. That was when I was still a little girl though.
<br /><br />It was only until I have experienced it myself that I realized a fairytale life wasn’t for me.
<br /><br />I do not want to be a Cinderella chosen by the prince over millions of other girls just because she has some stupid glass slippers. I do not want to be like Ariel who has to change who she really is just for the sake of being accepted. I do not want to end up as Snow White loved by a handsome prince only because the magic mirror says she is the fairest one of all. I need someone to grow old with, even if one day I may have wrinkled skin and may not anymore look like a Belle.
<br /><br />He may not be some Mr.-nice-guy who claims to have read the bible from cover to cover. He may not be a vice-free citizen who would most likely end up in the senate one day. He may not be a royal prince who could provide me with all the world’s riches and extravagance. He may not be a genius Einstein who could eventually bring home a Nobel Prize in the future.
<br /><br />But nevertheless, he is someone real, not a fiction but a fact.
<br /><br />He does not only give me millions of reasons to smile, but reasons to cry as well. Sometimes he can be the sweetest person alive, but he could also be the most annoying human being ever. He has his own ways of making me laugh, and has his unexplainable habits of driving me mad. He takes care of me whenever I do not feel well, but sometimes he himself makes me sick. But then at the end of the day, I just end up with more and more reasons to fall in love. I guess that is just how love truly is after all...
<br /><br />Love is real, not a fiction but a fact.

<br /><br />Last May 9-17 the DLSU-DEBSOC flew one team and two adjudicators to the 3rd Asian Universities Debate Championship (AUDC) which took place in Institut Teknologi Bandung (IT<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> Bandung, Indonesia. The AUDC is the most prestigious debate tournaments in the whole of Asia and in this year, there were thirty institutions, sixty debate teams, one hundred eighty- three debaters and seventy-one adjudicators all over Asia. Team De La Salle bested schools from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Jakarta, Malaysia, India and much more. The team comprise of Estelle O. Osorio (AB-POM 07’), Dino S. De Leon (ECM-LMG/III), Nico Tuason (BS-CS ST/IV), Robin Garcia (AB-DSM/II) and Jasper Go (PSM-BMG/III) with Estelle Osorio having earning the title of third overall best speaker of the tournament moreover the DLSU-DEBSOC chaired the executive committee of the next AUDC which will be held in the International Islamic University (IIU) in Malaysia. Moreover, Osorio will be part of the adjudicating core serving as one of the Deputy Chief Adjudicator of the upcoming 9th National Debate Championship in October this year.
<br /><br />Subsequently, last April 13-17 2007 the DLSU-DEBSOC took part in the Philippine Intercollegiate Debate Championships – Ninoy Aquino Cup (PIDC) which was hosted by the University of the Philippines-Diliman held in Tarlac. Initially the competition was called differently which team De la Salle championed in year 2003. PIDC was attended by forty debate teams and fifty-seven adjudicators representing universities and colleges all over the Philippines. This time DLSU-DEBSOC sent three debate teams and four adjudicators. The teams comprise of the following DLSU A - Estelle O. Osorio (AB-POM 07’), Dino De Leon (ECM-LMG/III), Nico Tuason (BS-CS ST/IV); DLSU B – Carmina Untalan (AB-POM/III), Bianca Lagdameo (ECM-BMG/IV), Victor Baguilat (AB-ISE 07’); DLSU C – Carlito Reyes (POM-LMG/ II), Jahra Roxas (ISJ-BMG/IV), Diana Cortez (BS-STAT/IV). The DLSU A reached quarter finals but was eventually beaten by the University of the Philippines – Diliman Team A (UPD A) who reached the finals. On the other hand DLSU Team B reached the octo finals but was eventually beaten by the University of the Philippines – Baguio Team A (UPB A). De Leon was 7th Overall Best Speaker while Osorio was 4th Overall Best Speaker.
<br /><br />However there was light seen in the adjudicators who also exhibited good performance.  They comprise of Robin Jason Sebolino (AB-LIM/III) who adjudicated up to the octofinal round, Angela Vargas (EDU-ENG) who likewise reached octofinals, Ren Delos Santos (AB-POM/II) who was at allocated at the quarterfinal rounds and Robin Michael Garcia (AB-DSM/II) who reached the semi-finals and eventually named as the 4th Overall Best Adjudicator of the tournament. All of the Lasallian adjudicators were among the top 16 adjudicators besting fifty-seven adjudicators in the tournament.
<br /><br />It is hence no doubt that the De La Salle Debate Society is still one of the debate powerhouses in the region. This particular accomplishment in the local and international debate scene is an important stepping stone towards the 9th National Debate Championship which will be held in the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio this coming October, as well as the upcoming World Universities Debate Championships which will be in Assumption University, Malaysia on December.
<br /><br />This year the De La Salle Debate Society will be celebrating its 50th year of existence in the university which makes them the oldest organization in the university. In this regard, there will be an alumni diner and an exhibit to display the credentials of the past debaters that represented the name of La Salle. Currently they are preparing to host a High School debate tournament in the country with an attempt to make it the largest and the most prestigious.
<br /><br />Clearly, even if the DLSU-DEBSOC is under funded and under recognized, it still works and endures tremendous amounts of hardships with untiring enthusiasm to represent the green and white in debating. Upholding the value of intellectual growth, critical thinking and a scholarly environment in the Lasallian community, the DLSU-DEBSOC does not fail to be the vanguard of the virtues of truth and democracy within the Lasallian community.
<br /><br />Animo La Salle!
<br /><br />(Published in the DLSU-EBSOC official news letter- The House Floor by Robin Garcia)

<br />miss na miss ko na pero marami akong nadidinig
<br />sa mga kaibigan na bumisita. Sabi nila 1 week 
<br />pa lang daw sila diyan gusto na nilang bumalik.
<br />Dahil daw ung mga ka-edad namin diyan(early twenties)
<br />very shallow at materialistic daw.
<br />Walang alam gawin kung di mag-inuman, mag-disco,
<br />mag-chismisan at gumastos ng pera ng magulang nila.
<br />Kung kakausapin mo para ka daw nakikipag-usap sa loro.
<br />Para bang napaka-inosente sa buhay at masaya na sila 
<br />kung ang T-shirt or sapatos nila eh brandname.
<br /><br />Kung sila ay nagta-try na maging Americanized at kaedad
<br />namin sila, eh dapat dun sila sa thrift store(second hand store)
<br />magsho-shopping dahil dun kami namimili.
<br />Yung mga boots ko, lahat made in china tapos second hand 
<br />pa pati na ang mga maong ko. Nahihiya ba ako dito,no.
<br />Do i give a SHIT about NIKE, Hell NO. Bakit ko uubusin
<br />ang pera ko sa mga kapritsong iyon kung mai-invest ko
<br />pa ito sa stock portfolio ko. Hindi kami nahihiya dahil it shows 
<br />that we are practical and we have our own identitiy.
<br /><br />The &quot;in&quot; thing now here in the States is to be young and 
<br />owning your own very creative business and taking
<br />care of yourself. Because we know nobody else will do
<br />it for us, not the goverment, not our relatives, or any other 
<br />fucking country out there. THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
<br />SPRIT OF THE AMERICANS SHOULD BE THE ONE WE 
<br />SHOULD IMITATE. not their brand names. I am sick
<br />and tired of hearing from the bobos that being americanized
<br />is a bad thing. Because they have limited understanding
<br />and are just plain ignorant of what it is about being an American.
<br /><br />Pilipino ako, i am proud that i am a Pilipino, pero Im proud
<br />that i am an American too. I feel that the Philippines is 
<br />my biological mother, no matter how she looks like, or no
<br />matter he character, I have to love her withought question
<br />or hesitation. The United States is my adoptive mother,
<br />she took care of me, educated me, protected me, and 
<br />provided for me, and I will always love her like i always love 
<br />my biological mother, if not more. Being an american
<br />does not just mean you're morally decadent, overly
<br />materialistic, divorce prone, and have no respect for the elder
<br />just as well as being a Filipino does not mean you're a maid
<br />or a mail order bride.
<br /><br />To me being a filipino is being very creative, adaptive, having
<br />a great sense of humour, and adventurous. 
<br /><br />Being an american means being egalitarian(no dons, donas 
<br />senioritos), independent, fair, and farsighted.
<br /><br />- Ryan Quijano

<br />the place of Megamall, Enchanted Kingdom, and
<br />Jollibee? Today, Starbucks spells gimmick.
<br />Suddenly everyone is mad about coffee, and is
<br />willing to spend a whoping hundred bucks for &quot;one
<br />tall mocha frappe please!&quot; or &quot;I'll have one grande
<br />iced coffee please!&quot; Everyone claims it's
<br />diffrent, it's something else, it's to die for.
<br />Instead of catching a nice flick at te cinema, 
<br />the Filipinos' new idea of fun is to voluntarily park
<br />their buns at the cafe and gulp all the caffeine
<br />they can.
<br /><br />No one knows exactly why Starbucks has
<br />become the hot spot, when they serve is
<br />just foamed Blend 45 for crying out loud. Oh,
<br />try pointing this out to Starbucks fanatics (i.e.,
<br />the likes of teeny-boppers and kikay girls), and
<br />you can expect getting attacked on how little you
<br />know about coffee. Get ready with answers like
<br />&quot;Duh! Starbucks isnt just coffee! They're
<br />ground beans and processed chocolate and
<br />skimmed milk! What do you know about that?&quot;
<br /><br />They have a point there, though, beacuse
<br />even in the United States, when you talk coffee,
<br />Starbucks comes first. Their ingredients are
<br />never questionable, and if im not mistaken,
<br />Starbucks is an established-since-year brand. In
<br />short, Starbucks is the coffee authority. But it
<br />ends there. Starbucks is coffee, period.
<br />Certainly not a gimmick place of some sort, not
<br />convincing enough as an alternative for the mall.
<br />This, I repeat, is the case in the United States.
<br /><br />But Starbucks invades Manila and here it
<br />becomes an obsession. As you may have already
<br />seen, the interiors of Starbucks cafes are all
<br />designed to create a distinct ambience. Notice
<br />from the Italian-tiled flooring, to the cowboy-
<br />motif wall covering, to the fancy lamps, tables and
<br />chairs crafted like those only seen in home
<br />magazines. Of course, behind which all the 
<br />grinders and blenders are displayed as if to remind
<br />you they really do process your cappuccino.
<br /><br />I mean, who can resist frequenting a posh
<br />place like this ? Instead of worrying about other
<br />important things, the typical kikay teenager puts
<br />on her best dress, and with her kikay friends
<br />goes straight to Starbucks where she orders
<br />&quot;one tall caramel frappe please!' This takes time
<br />to prepare, which is fine. She feels rewarded
<br />by the fact that the ethical barista would shout
<br />her name accross the room by time her frappe
<br />is ready. After she claims it, she heads for the
<br />seld-service corner where she takes excessive
<br />pockets of extra sugar, extra cream, an inch
<br />thick of Starbucks tissue paper for souvenir.
<br />Then she sits by the front window, hoping
<br />someone she knows would pass by and see her
<br />drinking expensive coffee. She takes remarkbly
<br />small sips in order to prolong her stay, like a real
<br />smart-ass.
<br /><br />During the entire process, there is the
<br />obligatory flaunting of Nokia cellphones, the
<br />occasional eruptions of &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;sure&quot; here and
<br />there. You get the impression everyone in the
<br />room is from the conyo sector. Pathetic as it is,
<br />the Starbucks athmosphere is so contagious that
<br />it simply brings out the social climber in one.
<br /><br />You haver to admit that the Philippine fran-
<br />chiser of Starbucks-whoever he is-deserves
<br />credit. He's certainly not stupid. He sees
<br />through us Filipinos, and definitely knows how to
<br />flatter us. Mr. Starbucks is aware of the average
<br />Pinoy desire to be associated and considered
<br />among the elite because well, in reality, the
<br />average Pinoy is far from being that, The average
<br />Pinoy home is less attractive than a place like
<br />Starbucks. the average Pinoy meal is without
<br />garnishes. The average Pinoy enviroment is less 
<br />comforting and convenient than the service of 
<br />Starbucks.
<br /><br />But when in Starbucks, the average Pinoy is 
<br />instantly made to feel he's in New York, or Las
<br />Vegas, or Paris, oranywhere else bit manilla-
<br />one probable reason why we Filipinos buy this 
<br />flick. We are total suckers for anything that is
<br />western in concept. But Starbucks has gone
<br />beyong colonial mentality; it has become pure
<br />escapism. It helps us forget about the EDSA
<br />traffic jam, the hostages in Mindanao, and the
<br />decreasing popularity of Erap. In this age of
<br />harsh realities of poverty and chaos, anything
<br />that offers oblivion and temporary indulgence
<br />sells fast. No matter how costly it is.
<br /><br />With their little creativity in repackaging,
<br />Starbucks is no longer just coffee. It's already
<br />a religion. That we Filipinos practically worship
<br />that green logo with the exotic lady shows where
<br />we derive out strength to move on. It is from
<br />the promise of Starbucks every pay day.

More than economic indicators, sosyal and bakya are psychographics. 
<br /><br />P U L L E E Z!!! Don't get me wrong-matapobre and elitsita I ain't, okay...Like one of my dear friends used to say, &quot;po' is a state of mind&quot; Like good taste. One doesn't need a lot of money to be stylish.
<br /><br />Traditionally sosyals are referred to as upper class and the bakya lower class. There is hardly a midle class in the Philippines so don't even bother counting THEM. And anyway they wouldn't know Yohji.
<br /><br />[b]However, a sosyal person with money can enjoy local films, programs and showbiz magazine like a bakya person can. They can go to Jollibee, a very successful local burger chain instead of McDonald&quot;s, which is foreign and sosyal.(I love Jollibee tuna sandwiches!) Even the biggest has-been in America like let's say Madonna can be  sosyal as long as she doesn't try coming to the Philippines to make a movie like jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven &quot; I found Gold in Manila&quot;Segal did. Ooohh ...excuse me-LAMMA Stephen Segal since he not only found gold but also religion; but that was in tibet.
<br /><br />The biggest stars in the Philippines, like late Rico Yan and action star Presidential Candidate Fernando Poe Jr. who had funerals better attended than the Queen Mother, are bakya. The masses, by sheer number, are what carry everything from products, stardom and political office because there are thousand times more poor people than rich people in the Philippines. There were also more people at those funerals because basically there are more Filipinos anywhere than there are Brits even if you count in the drug addicts and  pedophiles hiding in Asia.
<br /><br />Local movie stars are usually to the bakya-born like American movie stars are discovered among Appalachians in a trailer park in Iowa. They also get used to adulation by people of even lower stature than them.</strong>

But the people I am puzzled most are the people who want to sentence themselves earlier than their designated time. The people who are prone to commit suicide.
<br /><br />Some people in my life know that I am big fan of death. I do appreciate the beauty of death, the depth of its blackness and the dread it gives to people. The shock in people's face when they encounter a death-defying situation becomes an art-form in my sight. It is simply a creative dark energy. But I wonder how come I appreciate death and yet I do not intend to sentence myself for it. I mean I just find it very ironic that I like something but I do not choose to experience it even though I have to power to experience it.
<br /><br />I heard many stories of suicide attempts. There is the pessimistic girl whose views in life are so negative that it made her thought of just dying to escape from this negativity. A father who was too emotional in his family problem then that he almost gave in to suicide. And A boy who had been in a long relationship and who has been experiencing family problems at the same time just thought of ending it all by dying. Different stories from different people, but one common thing about all of them aside from their suicide thoughts, is that they are still alive until now.
<br /><br />Emos and Goths become the symbol of dark force. For me, Emos represent the emotional side of humans which usually presented as depression and suicide, and the Goths represent the people who live in the darker side not because they are evil but in order to learn to accept that pain, suffering and dying do exist and that we have to live with it and prepare for it instead of loathing it. From these people I learned something about suicide, suicide seems to be a calming caress to the soul of a person. It gives an energy and relief in surpassing a bad night of coldness and emptiness. Persons (not all) think of suicide during their down and sad times, and this calms them from thinking and being confuse with the situation. It is like a person is saying &quot;why don't just I end my life now... so that I can totally detach myself from the person who broke my heart. After I die tonight, I'll be gone on my own, in the abyss of my grave I will lie endlessly, numb and cold.&quot; The line talks about death, but as the line comes to end, it releases a positive energy.. &quot;in the abyss of my grave I will lie endlessly, numb and cold.&quot; It gives the person a vision of the benefit he could get if he ends his life, he'll be emotionless, devoid from the heartache he is currently experiencing and this makes the thought of suicide so powerful and fascinating. But after the bad night he had, when he is back on his feet again and he comes out to the light, thoughts of suicide fade. And that is the reason why the the pessimistic girl, emotional father and the heartbroken is still alive until now.
<br /><br />Suicide becomes a comfort zone, but unfortunately there are some who are not contented with just the thoughts. They do not find suicide thoughts too comforting, so they end up executing it. For those who find the thoughts comforting enough, may you do well with your life after the bad night. And to those who find the execution more comforting, may your rest in peace.
<br /><br />&quot;Sunday is gloomy with shadows I spend it all,
<br />My heart and I have decided to end it all,
<br />Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad,
<br />I know, let them not weep,
<br />Let them know that I'm glad to go&quot;
<br />-Gloomy Sunday
