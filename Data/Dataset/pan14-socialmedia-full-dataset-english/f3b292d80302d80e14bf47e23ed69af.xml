<br />home from the movies. The boy sensed
<br />there was something wrong because of
<br />the painful silence they shared
<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she
<br />wanted to talk. She told him that her
<br />feelings had changed &amp; that it was
<br />time to move on. A silent tear slid
<br />down his cheek as he slowly reached
<br />into his pocket &amp; passed her a folded
<br />note. At that moment, a drunk driver
<br />was speeding down that very same
<br />street. He swerved right into the
<br />drivers seat, killing the boy.
<br />Miraculously, the girl survived.
<br />Remembering the note, she pulled it
<br />out &amp; read it.
<br />&quot;Without your love, I would die.&quot;

<br /><br />this is GUY TALKING...
<br /><br />IT'S 7TH GRADE...
<br /><br />I stared at the girl next to me...She was my so called &quot;best friend&quot;... I stared at her... Long, silky hair... And I wished she was mine... But she didn't notice me like that... I knew it... After class she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before... And I handed them to her... She said &quot;thanks&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S JUNIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />My phone rang... On the other end it was her... She was in tears... Mumbling on and on about how her love had broken her heart... She asked me to come over because she didn't want to be alone... So I did... As I sat next to her on the sofa... I stared at her soft eyes... Wishing she was mine... After 2 hours... A Drew Barrymore movie... And 3 bags of chips... She decided to go to sleep... She looked at me.. Said &quot;thanks&quot; and gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I want her to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy to tell her... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S SENIOR YEAR...
<br /><br />The day before prom... She walked to my locker... &quot;My date is sick&quot; she said... He's not going to go... Well... I didn't have a date and in 7th grade... We made a promise that if neiter of us had dates... We'd go together just as &quot;best friends&quot;... And so we did...
<br /><br />IT'S PROM NIGHT...
<br /><br />After everything was over with... I was standing at her front door step... I stared at her ... She smiled at me... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me like that... And I know it... Then she said &quot;I had the best time... Thanks!&quot;... And she gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to telll her... I wanted her to know that I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S GRADUATION DAY...
<br /><br />A day passed... And then a week... And then a month... Before I could blink... It was graduation day... I watched her... Perfect body... Floated like an angel up on stage to get her diploma... I wanted her to be mine... But she doesn't think of me that way... And I know it... Before everyone went home... She came to me in her smock and hat... And cried as I hugged her... Then she lifted her head from my shoulders and said &quot;you're my best friend&quot;... &quot;Thanks!&quot;... And gave me a kiss on the cheek... I wanted to tell her.. I wanted to know that I wanted to be more than &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />IT'S A FEW YEARS LATER...
<br /><br />Now I sit in the pews of the church... A church that she is getting married in now... I watched her say &quot;I do&quot; an drive off to her new life... Married to another man... I wanted her to be mine... But she didn't see me like that... And I knew it... But before she drove away... She came to me and said &quot;You came!... Thanks!&quot;... And she kissed me on the cheek... I wanted to tell her... I wantd her to know that I didn't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love her but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why...
<br /><br />YEARS PASSED...
<br /><br />I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my &quot;best friend&quot;... At the service they read a diary entry she had wrote in her high school years... This is what it said... &quot;I stare at him... Wishing he was mine... But he doesn't notice me like that... And I know it... I wanted to tell him... I wanted him to know... That I don't want to be &quot;just friends&quot;... I love him but I'm just too shy... And I don't know why... I wish he would tell me he loved me&quot;... I wish I did too... I thought to myself and I cried...

<br />between them that night. The girl then
<br />asked the boy to pull over because she

<br />Report abuse Share today at 01:37
<br /><br />(This was written by a guy)
<br /><br />Don't break this; it's so sweet!
<br /><br />1. They will always smell good even if it's just shampoo.
<br /><br />2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder.
<br /><br />3. How cute they look when they sleep.
<br /><br />4. The ease in which they fit into our arms.
<br /><br />5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world.
<br /><br />6. How cute they are when they eat.
<br /><br />7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end it makes it all worth while.
<br /><br />8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 outside.
<br /><br />9. The way they look good no matter what they wear.
<br /><br />10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she's the most beautiful girl on this earth.
<br /><br />11. How cute they are when they argue.
<br /><br />12. The way her hand always finds yours.
<br /><br />13. The way they smile.
<br /><br />14. The way you feel when you see their name on the your cell after you just had a big fight.
<br /><br />15. The way she says &quot;lets not fight anymore&quot; - even though you know that an hour later....
<br /><br />16. The way that they kiss after you have had a fight.
<br /><br />17. The way they kiss you when you say &quot;I love you&quot;.
<br /><br />18. Actually...Just the way they kiss you...
<br /><br />19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry.
<br /><br />20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly.
<br /><br />21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt.
<br /><br />22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt (even though we don't admit it).
<br /><br />23. The way they say &quot;I miss you&quot;.
<br /><br />24. The way you miss them.
<br /><br />25. The way their tears make you want to change the world so that it doesn't hurt her anymore...
<br /><br />Yet regardless if you love them, hate them, wish they would die or know that you would die without them it matters not. Because once in your life, whatever they were to the world they become everything to you. When you look them in the eyes, traveling to the depths of their souls and you say a million things without trace of a sound, you know that your own life is inevitable consumed within the rhythmic beatings of her very heart. We love them for a million reasons, no paper would do it justice. It is a thing not of the mind but of the heart.
<br /><br />A feeling.
<br /><br />Only felt.
<br /><br />This chain started in 2002.
<br /><br />It is a love chain letter.
<br /><br />In an hour you are supposed to repost this.
<br /><br />Once you read this letter, you must IMMEDIATELY (meaning within the hour)
<br />post it with the title &quot;why do boys fall in love with girls? &quot;
<br />After you send it, make a wish and it will come true
