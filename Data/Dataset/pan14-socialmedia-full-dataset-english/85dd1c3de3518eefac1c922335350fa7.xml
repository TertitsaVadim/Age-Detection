<br /><br />Just because you were born in '97 doesn't mean you're a 90's kid.
<br /><br />It's not like you could remember the original Simpsons. I am sorry but three conscious years of the 90's just wont cut it.
<br /><br />You're a 90's kid if:

<br /><br />You remember when Super Nintendos and Sega Genisis became popular.
<br /><br />You always wanted to send in a tape to Britain's Funniest Home Videos . . . But never taped anything funny.

<br /><br />You played and/or collected &quot;Pogs&quot;.
<br /><br />Collecting stickers for sticker books.
<br /><br />You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet, or Nano and brought it everywhere.
<br /><br />Furbies.
<br /><br />You haven't always had a computer, and it was cool to have the Internet.
<br /><br />And Windows 95 was the best.
<br /><br />You watched the original cartoons of Rugrats, Power Rangers, and Ninja Turtles.
<br /><br />Michael Jordan was a king.
<br /><br />When wrestling was good. WWF!

<br /><br />You went to McDonald's to play in the playplace.
<br /><br />You remember playing on merry go rounds at the playground.
<br /><br />Before the MySpace frenzy . . .

<br /><br />Before creatives &amp; iPods . . .
<br /><br />Before emos and chavs. . .
<br /><br />Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX . . .
<br /><br />Before Spongebob . . .
<br /><br />When light up trainers were cool.
<br /><br />When everyone wore visors.
<br /><br />When you rented VHS tapes, not DVDs.
<br /><br />Caller ID was a new thing.
<br /><br />When everyone had at least one of those little gooey aliens in a pod.
<br /><br />When no-one knew how to get them 'pregnant'.
<br /><br />When we recorded stuff on VCRs.
<br /><br />When we called the radio station to request songs to hear off of our walkman.
<br /><br />When checking out drawing books and that one book about the rainbow fish from the library was THE cool thing to do.
<br /><br />You had slap braclets!
<br /><br />Way back.
<br /><br />Before we realized all this would eventually disappear.
<br /><br />Who would have thought you'd miss the 90's so much!!!!!

<br /><br />Post with the year you were born in

<br /><br />The first thing you do if you hear tornado sirens during the day is check your watch to see if it's noon.
<br /><br />You don't get worried unless the sky looks &quot;green&quot;.
<br /><br />You use the word &quot;tornado&quot; as a verb.
<br /><br />You chuckle at all the facebook groups called &quot;I survived the ___ tornado.&quot;
<br /><br />You might go indoors when there's a tornado, but you won't &quot;seek shelter&quot; for anything less than an F3.
<br /><br />You know what Doppler radar, Hook echo, wall cloud, and rain-wrapped all mean.
<br /><br />You've never exactly memorized the tornado precautions, but you've heard them enough times that you know them by heart anyway.
<br /><br />Watching the weather is entertaining. And red on the Doppler radar is exciting.
<br /><br />The phrase &quot;Tornado on the ground, take your immediate tornado precautions&quot; sends exciting shivers up your spine.
<br /><br />You've seen photos/videos of tornados and said, &quot;Wow, that's a nice one!&quot;
<br /><br />You can feel/smell tornado weather brewing a few hours before the storm actually begins.
<br /><br />There's an odd feeling as though you've misplaced something if you make it all the way to June without a tornado warning near you.
<br /><br />You think people that live in earthquake and/or hurricane prone areas are crazy.
<br /><br />You know what people are talking about when they mention the &quot;May 3rd&quot; tornado.
<br /><br />You watch the movie &quot;Twister&quot; just so you can point out all the inaccuracies in it.
<br /><br />You know your weathermen by their first names. i.e. Gary.
<br /><br />When you hear the tornado sirens go off, you go outside to watch the storm and take pictures.
<br /><br />Most of the tornado video footage comes from everyday people with camcorders instead of from actual news/weathermen.
<br /><br />You're sure there's a giant tornado magnet hidden somewhere in Moore. And that there are smaller ones distributed throughout trailer parks.
<br /><br />You know that the four seasons are actually: summer, late summer, winter (if you're lucky), and tornado.
<br /><br />You don't consider it windy until the windspeed is faster than 30mph.
<br /><br />You are highly entertained by people from outside tornado alley when there is a tornado watch. (Especially if you're the one who's visiting the other state.)
<br /><br />Your school has tornado drills. And you assumed that schools in every other state had them as well.
<br /><br />There's enough random stuff in your tornado shelter that you could live there for a year.
<br /><br />You stand under your carport or open your front door to watch hail and/or thunderstorms.
<br /><br />You know the difference between a basement, a cellar, and a storm shelter.
<br /><br />The weather is a completely acceptable subject for conversation, at any time, for any occasion.
<br /><br />Your local mall has &quot;tornado shelter&quot; signs posted.
<br /><br />It doesn't bother you the next day to find out that your area was under a tornado watch the night before and you had no idea. Unless, of course, it caused you to miss some interesting cloud formations.
<br /><br />Getting to &quot;play&quot; in the basement/cellar/storm shelter excites you or numbers among your favorite childhood memories.
<br /><br />You keep matches, candles, and candleholders in more than one place in your house.
<br /><br />Your town will never get hit by a tornado because you're between two rivers or because an old Indian legend says so.
<br /><br />You complain about severe weather reports that interrupt the TV show you're watching.
<br /><br />You can get together all your most important possessions in 2 minutes flat.
<br /><br />When tornado sirens woke you up in the middle of the night...you rolled over and went back to sleep.
<br /><br />You've ever tried to reassure someone by saying that &quot;if anything forms it will only be a little tornado&quot;...and couldn't understand why this didn't calm them down any.
<br /><br />It's normal for your area to be under a tornado watch for multiple days in a row.
<br /><br />You laughed at everything in this list, but you also respect a tornado's power. And you know that after it's over, clean-up and re-building has to begin.

<br />sitting 
<br />there having a good time together, she starts talking about this really
<br /><br />great new drink. The more she talks about it, the more excited she
<br />gets, 
<br />and starts trying to talk her boyfriend into having one. After a
<br />while he 
<br />gives in and lets her order the drink for him. The bartender brings
<br />the 
<br />drink and puts the following items on the bar:
<br /><br />A salt shaker, a shot of Baileys, and a shot of lime juice.
<br /><br />The boyfriend looks at the items quizzically and the woman explains.
<br />'First 
<br />you put a bit of the salt on your tongue, next you drink the shot of
<br />Baileys 
<br />and hold it in your mouth, and finally you drink the lime juice.'
<br /><br />So, the boyfriend, trying to go along and please her, goes for it. He
<br />puts 
<br />the salt on his tongue...salty but OK.
<br /><br />He drinks the shot of Baileys......smooth, rich, cool, very pleasant.
<br /><br />He thinks........this is OK.
<br /><br />Finally he picks up the lime juice and drinks it.... In one second the
<br />sharp 
<br />lime taste hits.......
<br /><br />At two seconds the Baileys curdles...
<br /><br />At three seconds the salty, curdled taste &amp; mucous-like consistency 
<br />hits.......
<br /><br />At four seconds it feels as if he has a mouth full of nasty snot.
<br /><br />This triggers his gag reflex, but being manly, and not wanting to
<br />disappoint 
<br />his girlfriend, he swallows the now foul tasting drink.
<br /><br />When he finally chokes it down he turns to his girlfriend, and
<br />says,'Jesus, 
<br />what do you call that drink?'
<br /><br />She smiles widely at him and says, 'Blow Job Revenge.

<br /><br />(1) Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up. 
<br />(2) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house. 
<br />(3) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually end in fine. 
<br />(4) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission. Don't do It. 
<br />(5) Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about nothing. (Refer back to # 3 for the meaning of nothing.) 
<br />(6) That's Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a wom an can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. 
<br />(7) Thanks: A woman is thanking you. Do not question, or faint; just say you're welcome. I want to add in a clause here: This is true unless she says &quot;Thanks a lot&quot; - that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say &quot;you're welcome&quot; in this case, for that will bring on a &quot;whatever&quot;. 
<br />(8) Whatever: Is a women's way of saying Buzz Off ! (or words to that effect) 
<br />(9) Don't worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has asked a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking &quot;What's wrong?&quot; For the woman's response refer to # 3.
