<br />The novel led to the expression &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; being used to pejoratively refer to an African-American who is subservient to whites.
<br />. 
<br />They are propagating an image of black people as submissive and uneducated people.
<br />As a black person living among then for over 20 years, I am sure that most germans are were clearly displeased
<br />against these kind of racist ideias and expressions. But the true is that Europe is seeing its share of insensitive racial blunders. Even the Chanceler Angela Merkel said this morning on a TV interview that &quot;... she is happy that a colored achieved that position...&quot;.Also a leading Austrian television journalist said on camera that he &quot;wouldn't want the Western world to be directed by a black man.&quot; A Polish lawmaker stood up in Parliament and called the election result &quot;the end of the white man's civilization.&quot; Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , during a visit to Moscow, praised Obama for being &quot;young, handsome and even suntanned.&quot; 
<br /><br />On the other hand, visitors to Berlin are often surprised to find there is a subway station in the city called Onkel Toms Hütte, after a residential district which was named in tribute to the novel.

<br />&quot; request the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way &quot; Runtime Error.
<br /><br />The main reasons for that are:
<br /><br />Program or TSR conflict
<br />Software issue 
<br />Computer Virus 
<br />Memory issue 
<br /><br />In my case it was an Add-on to Word (PDFMaker) causing it to quit.
<br />Because that was my first &quot;suspect&quot;, I went to:
<br /><br />Start/regedit
<br /><br />and under the key: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftOfficeWordAddinsPDFMaker.OfficeAddin]
<br />RMC(RightMouseClick) and after export the key (that´s safer !!)  just send it to the &quot;Data Paradise&quot;(delete it !!).
<br /><br />It helps me ! So I hope this helps others too !
<br /><br />If you have any question, just post me a message!
<br /><br />Enjoy &amp; have fun !

<br />asking to run the &quot;Disk CleanUp Utility&quot; and that may be pretty annoying. To turn that off, do as follow:
<br /><br />- Go to &quot;Start&quot; , run and write &quot;regedit&quot;
<br />- on the left side, look for this path: HKEY CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionPoliciesExplorer
<br />- then on the right-side, right-mouse click(RMC) and create a new DWORD named NoLowDiskSpaceChecks
<br />- Double-click that and enter the value 1 and press &quot;OK&quot;.

<br />- do the obvious and reset permission &amp; restart
<br />- make sure to have the latest version of iTunes
<br />- ask yourself if you imported the song/songs in .wav format
<br />- check your import encoder preferences under :
<br />	Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Importing &gt; Import Using : MP3 Encoder or Apple Lossless
<br />-  delete the imported song/songs and add then again.
<br /><br />That´s it and goo luck !

<br /><br />If you are migrating from Win(PC) to OSX(Mac), chances are that you´ll need your contacts to stick with you.
<br />So here is my suggestion :
<br />- there´s no real solution to this without using an extra software !
<br />You need a workaround :
<br />1- install Thunderbird from Mozilla (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozillamessaging.com%2Fen-US%2Fthunderbird%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/</a>) in your Windows,which is a free cross-platform email client.
<br />2 - start Thunderbird and under Tools /Import select the Address Book option, click Next and choose Outlook and click Next. You just imported your Outlook contacts into Thunderbird !
<br />3 - select all your contacts in Thunderbird and choose Tools/Export. choose LDIF (from the Save as...) and save the file after naming it.
<br />4 - transfer this file to your Mac, launch Address Book, and choose File/Import/LDIF. Point to the LDIF file you brought over from Windows. 
<br /><br />Your Outlook/OE contacts are now under Address Book !
<br /><br />Enjoy !

<br />&lt;pre&gt;
<br />This topic is incredible cause even Apple did not to send a global e-mail admitting to this problem and that a repair is forthcoming !
<br /><br />Due to the SSE2/SSE3 Standards compliant the new iTunes updatet cause an error with older PC hardware that make songs sound like &quot;The Chipmunks on acid with an alien back-up band&quot;......HORRIBLE !,specially:
<br />SSE2 is an extension of the IA-32 architecture. Therefore any architecture that does not support IA-32 does not support SSE2. x86-64 CPUs all implement IA-32. All known x86-64 CPUs also implement SSE2.[citation needed] Since IA-32 predates SSE2, early IA-32 CPUs did not implement it. SSE2 and the other SIMD instruction sets were intended primarily to improve CPU support for realtime graphics, notably gaming. A CPU that is not marketed for this purpose or that has an alternative SIMD instruction set has no need for SSE2.
<br />The following CPUs implemented IA-32 after SSE2 was developed, but did not implement SSE2:
<br />    •    AMD CPUs prior to Athlon 64, including all Socket A-based CPUs
<br />    •    Intel CPUs prior to Pentium 4
<br />    •    VIA C3
<br />    •    Transmeta Crusoe
<br /><br />Everything works fine for me after following these downgrade instructions :
<br /><br />Until Apple comes out with a fix, I downgraded to iTunes 10.4 32bit (Warning - all libraries and playlists must be rebuilt using this method):
<br />	1.	Copy My Music/iTunes folder to a safe location
<br />	2.	Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs - Uninstall iTunes
<br />	3.	Control Panel - Add/Remove Programs - Uninstall QuickTime
<br />	4.	Run CCleaner Registry Cleaner and restart (recommended)
<br />	5.	Download iTunes 10.4 from FileHippo.com (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.filehippo.com%2Fdownload_itunes_32%2F10448%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_itunes_32/10448/</a>)
<br />	6.	Run iTunes installer
<br />	7.	Import music file containing mp3s (iTunes - File - Add File to library)
<br />	8.	Test playback of file.
<br />	9.	Download Quicktime 7.6 (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2FDL762"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL762</a>)
<br />	10.	Run QuickTime Installer
<br />	11.	Restore the files you saved in Step 1.  Create &amp; Copy folders from back-up file to the following folders.
<br />	?	Automatically Add to iTunes
<br />	?	Books
<br />	?	Downloads
<br />	?	Mobile Applications
<br />	?	Music
<br />	?	Podcasts
<br />	?	
<br />Restart iTunes and you should be back in business.  If your iPhone is iOS 5, you will need to refrain from syncing until Apple sorts this out.??Enjoy !
