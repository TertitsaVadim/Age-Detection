<br />Doesn't have words that I can describe 
<br />The loneliness I feel throughout 
<br />It was her fault without a doubt 
<br />She's still alive but to me she's dead 
<br />Of everything that we've ever said 
<br />I can't stand to live with her 
<br />All the time we fight 
<br />Because I don't forget anything 
<br />Nothing’s alright 
<br />My Dad says she cares 
<br />He says that she's stable 
<br />When I was cutting myself 
<br />She only cared about the table 
<br />I don't know how I'll feel today or tomorrow 
<br />‘Cause every other day is a day I feel sorrow 
<br />Some kids are lucky 
<br />Not having to deal with this bomb 
<br />Because this poems about you, so called--Mom

<br />it comes from deep inside.
<br />I get all mad and angry,
<br />wanting to go and hide.
<br /><br />My doctor calls it depression,
<br />my dad says it's just me.
<br />But the thoughts and feelings,
<br />no one will ever be able to see.
<br /><br />Some say I'm psycho,
<br />some say I'm just weird.
<br />It's like I'm a different person,
<br />and the old me just disappeared.
<br /><br />I get really edgy,
<br />I want to commit suicide real bad.
<br />Then I get a headache,
<br />followed by feeling sad.
<br /><br />I wish I could get help,
<br />I wish it would go away.
<br />Maybe if I keep praying real hard,
<br />it will some day.

<br />Her favorite dress tied with a bow
<br />Today was Daddy's Day at school
<br />And she couldn't wait to go.
<br />But her mommy tried to tell her,
<br />That she probably should stay home.
<br />Why the kids might not understand,
<br />If she went to school alone.
<br />But she was not afraid;
<br />She knew just what to say.
<br />What to tell her classmates
<br />Of why he wasn't there today.
<br />But still her mother worried,
<br />For her to face this day alone.
<br />And that was why once again,
<br />She tried to keep her daughter home.
<br />But the little girl went to school,
<br />Eager to tell them all.
<br />About a dad she never sees,
<br />A dad who never calls.
<br />There were daddies along the wall in back,
<br />For everyone to meet
<br />Children squirming impatently,
<br />Anxious in their seats.
<br />One by one the teacher called,
<br />Each student from the class.
<br />To introduce their daddy,
<br />As seconds slowly passed.
<br />At last the teacher called her name,
<br />Every child turned to stare.
<br />Each of them was searching,
<br />For a man who wasn't there.
<br />&quot;Where's her daddy at?&quot;
<br />She heard a boy call out.
<br />&quot;She probably doesn't have one&quot;
<br />Another student dared to shout.
<br />And from somewhere near the back,
<br />She heard a daddy say,
<br />&quot;Looks like another deadbeat dad,
<br />Too busy to waste his day.&quot;
<br />The words did not offened her,
<br />As she smiled up at her mom.
<br />And looked back at her teacher,
<br />Who told her to go on.
<br />And with hands behind her back,
<br />Slowly she began to speak.
<br />And out from the mouth of a child,
<br />Came words incredibly unique.
<br />&quot;My daddy couldn't be here,
<br />Because he lives so far away.
<br />But I know he wishes he could be,
<br />Since this is such a special day.
<br />And though you cannot meet him,
<br />I wanted you to know.
<br />All about my daddy,
<br />And how much he loves me so.
<br />He loved to tell me stories
<br />He taught me to ride my bike.
<br />He surprised me with pink roses,
<br />And taught me to fly a kite.
<br />We used to share fudge sundaes,
<br />and ice cream in a cone.
<br />And though you cannot see him,
<br />I'm not standing here alone.
<br />Cause my daddy's always with me
<br />Even though we are apart.
<br />I know because he told me,
<br />He'll forever be in my heart.&quot;
<br />With that, her little hand reached up,
<br />and lay across her chest.
<br />Feeling her own heartbeat,
<br />Beneath her favorite dress.
<br />And from somewhere in the crowd of dads,
<br />Her mother stood in tears.
<br />Proudly watching her daughter,
<br />Who was wise beyond her years.
<br />For she stood up for the love
<br />Of a man not in her life.
<br />Doing what was best for her,
<br />Doing what was right.
<br />And when she dropped her hand back down,
<br />Staring straight into the crowd.
<br />She finished with a voice so soft,
<br />But its message clear and loud.
<br />&quot;I love my daddy very much,
<br />He's my shining star.
<br />And if he could he'd be here,
<br />But heaven's just too far.
<br />You see he was a fireman
<br />And died just this past year.
<br />When airplanes hit the towers
<br />And taught Americans to fear.
<br />But sometimes when I close my eyes,
<br />It's like he never went away.&quot;
<br />And then she closes her eyes,
<br />And saw him there that day.
<br />And to her mother's amazement,
<br />She witnessed with surprise.
<br />A room full of daddies and children,
<br />All starting to close their eyes.
<br />Who knows what they say before them,
<br />Who knows what they felt inside.
<br />Perhaps for merely a second,
<br />They saw him at her side.
<br />&quot;I know you're with me Daddy.&quot;
<br />To the silence she called out.
<br />And what happened next made believers,
<br />Of those once filled with doubt.
<br />Not one in that room could explain it,
<br />For each of their eyes had been closed.
<br />But there on the desk beside her,
<br />Was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.
<br />And a child was blessed, if only for a moment,
<br />By the love of her shining bright star.
<br />And given the gift of believing,
<br />That heaven is never too far

<br />And remembered what you said. 
<br />you told me not to drink, Mum 
<br />So I had a Sprite instead. 
<br />I felt proud of myself, 
<br />the way you said I would, 
<br />That I didn't drink and drive, 
<br />though some friends said I should. 
<br />I made a healthy choice, 
<br />and your advice to me was right 
<br />as the party finally ended, 
<br />and the kids drove out of sight. 
<br />I got into my car, 
<br />sure to get home in one piece, 
<br />I never knew what was coming, Mum 
<br />something I expected least. 
<br />Now I'm lying on the pavement, 
<br />And I hear the policeman say, 
<br />The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,&quot; 
<br />Mum, His voice seems far away. 
<br />My own blood all around me, 
<br />as I try hard not to cry. 
<br />I can hear the paramedic say, 
<br />&quot;This girl is going to die.&quot; 
<br />I'm sure the guy had no idea, 
<br />while he was flying high, 
<br />because he chose to drink and drive, 
<br />now I would have to die. 
<br />So why do people do it, Mum 
<br />Knowing that it ruins lives? 
<br />And now the pain is cutting me, 
<br />like a hundred stabbing knives. 
<br />Tell sister not to be afraid, Mum 
<br />tell daddy to be brave, 
<br />and when I go to heaven, 
<br />put &quot;Daddy's Girl&quot; on my grave.
<br />Someone should have taught him, 
<br />that it's wrong to drink and drive. 
<br />Maybe if his parents had, 
<br />I'd still be alive. 
<br />My breath is getting shorter, Mum 
<br />I'm getting really scared. 
<br />These are my final moments, 
<br />and I'm so unprepared. 
<br />I wish that you could hold me Mum, 
<br />as I lie here and die. 
<br />I wish that I could say I love you, Mum 
<br />So I love you and good-bye

Anger is only one letter short of danger. If someone betrays you once, it is his fault. If he betrays you twice, it is your fault. He who loses money, loses much. He who loses a friend, loses much more. He who loses faith, loses all. Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old people are works of art. Learn from the mistakes of others. You can’t live long enough to make them all yourself
<br /><br />It takes no talent, no brains and no character to criticise. Only god can create a flower but any foolish child can pull it to pieces. When people are hostile or rude, when they cheat, lie or steal, say cruel and bitchy things, it is nothing other than a reflection of their own troubled, sad, pathetic life, rather than a reflection of you. Don`t listen to them, you are who you are, don’t change for anyone. 
<br />BE PROUD! when a girl.....   So SaD <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> When a girl is quiet,
<br />Millions of things are running through her mind.
<br /><br />When a girl is not arguing,
<br />She is thinking deeply.
<br /><br />When a girl looks at you with eyes full of questions,
<br />She is wondering how long you will be around.
<br /><br />When a girl answers &quot;im fine&quot; after a few seconds,
<br />She is not fine.
<br /><br />When a girl stares at you,
<br />She is wondering why your lying.
<br /><br />When a girl lays on your chest,
<br />She is wishing for you to be hers forever.
<br /><br />When a girl calls you everyday,
<br />She is seeking for your attention.
<br /><br />When a girl wants to see you everyday,
<br />She wants to be pampered.
<br /><br />When a girl texts you everyday,
<br />She wants you to reply at least once.
<br /><br />When a girl says &quot;i love you&quot;,she means it.
<br /><br />When a girl says &quot;i can't live without you&quot;,
<br />She has made up her mind that you are her future.
<br /><br />When a girl says &quot;i miss you&quot;,
<br />No one in this whole world can miss you more than her... -always tell them-
<br />boy- hey, hun

<br />boy- why didnt you tell me????
<br />&gt;girl- I didnt want to hurt you.
<br />boy- you could never hurt me
<br />girl- I just wanted to see if you felt bout me as the same I felt bout you.

<br />girl- I love you more than anything, I would give you the world in a heartbeat. I would die for you and take a bullet for you.
<br />boy- ...........
<br />girl- dont be sad, I love you and I'll always be here with you
<br />boy- then why'd you break up with me?
<br />nurse- young man, visiting hours are over.
<br />BOY LEAVES, GIRL IS TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT, AND DIES.
<br />But what the boy didn't know is that the girl only asked him those questions so she could hear him say it one last time, and she only broke up with him because she knew she only had 3 more weeks to live, and thought it would cause him less pain and give him time   to get over her before she died. NEXT DAY the boy is found dead with a gun in his hand..with a note in the other...
<br />THE NOTE SAID:
<br />I told her I would take a bullet for her.... just like she said she would die for me...
<br /><br />Always tell your loved ones how you feel!??? View High

<br /><br />Teddy, I’ve been bad again, my mommy told me so
<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what I did wrong, but I thought that you should know
<br /><br />When I woke up this morning, I knew that she was mad
<br /><br />‘Cause she was crying awful hard, and yelling at my dad
<br /><br />I tried my best to be real good, and do just what she said
<br /><br />I cleaned my room all by myself, I even made my bed
<br /><br />But I spilled milk on my good shirt, when she yelled at me to hurry
<br /><br />And I guess she didn’t hear me, when I told her I was sorry.
<br /><br />‘Cause she hit me awful hard, you see, and called me funny names
<br /><br />and told me I was really bad, and that I should be ashamed!
<br /><br />When I said &quot;I love you mommy, I guess she didn’t understand
<br /><br />‘Cause she yelled at me to shut my mouth, or I’d get smacked again.
<br /><br />So I came up here to talk to you, please tell me what to do
<br /><br />‘Cause I really love my mommy, and I know she loves me too
<br /><br />And I don’t think my mommy means to hit me quite so very hard
<br /><br />I guess sometimes grown ups forget, how really big they are!
<br /><br />So teddy, I wish you were real, and you weren’t just a teddy bear
<br /><br />Then you could help me find a way to tell mommy’s everywhere
<br /><br />To please try hard to understand, how sad it makes me feel
<br /><br />‘Cause the outside pain soon goes away, but the inside never heals!
<br /><br />And if we could make them listen, maybe then they’d understand
<br /><br />So other children just like me, wouldn’t have to hurt again
<br /><br />But for now I guess I’ll hold you tight and pretend the pain’s not there
<br /><br />I know you’d never hurt me, so goodnight teddy bear!

<br />After all you're still only a child 
<br />You have parents, that are supposed to protect you 
<br />But often they don't, more than they do 
<br />Some fathers love their kids more than anything 
<br />But there are bad ones, that disgrace they will bring 
<br />You dread the night, when you go to bed 
<br />That he will come in, say things that shouldn't be said 
<br />They will sneak around when no one else is home 
<br />They can't hurt you if they can't catch you alone 
<br />They will say you can't tell what they did to you 
<br />They will tell you lies that just aren't true 
<br />You get so you can't stand his filthy touch 
<br />They say they do this because they love you so much 
<br />You want his love and so afraid to tell 
<br />Love him so much, don't want him in jail 
<br />You feel so hopeless and so very sad 
<br />Can't remember a time, that he made you glad 
<br />If your mother doesn't believe you, continue to tell 
<br />You need to do something, scream or yell 
<br />This is a poem, that's hard to hear 
<br />You don't deserve the pain and all the fear 
<br />Some people have children, they don't derserve 
<br />Our children's rights, we have to preserve 
<br />You can go to school and tell your teacher 
<br />If that doesn't work go and tell your preacher!

<br />a train running through my mind 
<br />tree's fall knocking out the lights 
<br />and I somehow, lose all track of time 
<br /><br />I sat there in that corner all alone 
<br />wondering what will happen next 
<br />praying that he didn't come home 
<br />I was wrong, now I'm in a hell of a fix 
<br /><br />I heard her tell him, I got beat up bad 
<br />he had to come and look for himself 
<br />when he saw me crying he did get mad 
<br />after that beating, all I thought of was death 
<br /><br />I was always wrong because he had his own rule 
<br />and no matter what I did, it just wasn't enough 
<br />I even had thoughts of camping out at school 
<br />because living at home was getting to be rough 
<br /><br />I use to cry a lot, but I got broke in with pain 
<br />it's hard to do at time, and I can't understand 
<br />holding the tears all the years who can explain 
<br />he walked around, proudly calling himself a man 
<br /><br />He just didn't know what I had been thinking 
<br />pay him back for all the pain that he gave me 
<br />wait till he passed out from all the drinking 
<br />could burn the house down and I would be free 
<br /><br />It's sad to think of all the pain a child gets 
<br />so hard to deal with and seems no one cares 
<br />they go through this life with so many regrets 
<br />from living in shame and hiding from fear 
<br /><br />when will it ever stop?
