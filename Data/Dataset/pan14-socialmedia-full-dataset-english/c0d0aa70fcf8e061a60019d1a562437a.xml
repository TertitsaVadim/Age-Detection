Britain includes a flag!&quot; had been echoed by users from the Continental Congress. But then, a flag is critical. It truly is a image representing a group and their beliefs -- a means of identification.<br /><br />It has extended been noted that in May possibly of 1776, Betsy Ross sewed the first edition in the flag we use today. The American flag has, of course, gone by means of many design transformations because then, as states were extra towards the nation and stars had been additional for the design.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Symbolism Abounding&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Special and interesting as the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2llbC1haXJtYXguY29t" target="_blank">Air Max Pas Cher</a> style is, I feel our flag can also be complete of symbolism. To me, the red stripes reveal courage, blood and struggling. The white stripes indicate truth, purity and open-mindedness. The word stripes, alone, is related to oppressions, struggles, punishments and lessons discovered. An enduring flag represents a state of surving or coming-of-age the challenging way.<br /><br />To me, the stars on our flag signify objectives, dreams as well as the long term -- what we all goal for, in our own way -- the infinite, the stars. The color blue is normally recognized with peace, tranquility and spirituality. With any luck ,, our goals and long term is going to be surrounded by peace and spirituality, just since the stars within the flag are surrounded from the blue.<br /><br />Our flag is extremely much like our nation. It's woven collectively by several threads, equally as our nation is woven with each other by many nationalities, religions, philosophies and personalities.<br /><br />The flag needs to be held up and supported to wave free of charge, equally as our nation requirements assistance to continue to stay as totally free because it continues to be. Any little breeze can lead to a reaction. A harsh wind can make the flag angrily whip around on its foundation. But, even when it gets to be weathered and torn, hanging on by only a few strands, as long as it is nevertheless connected to its groundwork, it'll continue to hang on and wave freely. It is the wind blowing against the flag that retains it waving, that enables the stars (at the same time because the stripes) to be seen. It is the winds of properly-channeled protest and criticism brought in opposition to a nation that retains it altering and shaping and thus, stops it from sinking into a Air Max Pas Cher false euphoria or apathy...or even worse.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Not as Simple as it Seems&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />The flag is not black and white, and neither are most issues involving it.

Res.10&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" /> giving Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration with the flag, continues to be up for vote several times. However, &quot;desecration&quot; signifies more than becoming burned or shredded in anger and protest. By way of the popular sale of interpretated versions of our flag that is been placed on things ranging from paper notebooks and jewellery, to shirts and table cloths, it is been verified the flag has a advertising appeal also as a patriotic one. But Title 4, Segment 8-d, 8-g and 8-i from the U.S. Code (guidelines and laws) forbids wearing it or placing an image of it on something which is meant to become thrown absent. The code also states that it isn't be be utilised for advertising functions. As a result, it's always intriguing to see how &quot;desecration&quot; is interpretated.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;An Implied Pledge&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Any flag represents a nation or group's future, too as it is previous. So, prior to you burn up it or praise it, condemn it or pledge allegiance to it, you must consider yet another appear at it and genuinely see it for what it represents.<br /><br />Often I believe that our nation's &quot;pledge&quot; has gone to yet another rectangular object...a green one. With all the crime and corruption in this nation, it's <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2llbC1haXJtYXguY29t" target="_blank">Air Max Pas Cher</a> as in the event the &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; continues to be subconsciously rewritten to:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I pledge allegiance to the dollar<br />&lt;br&gt;of the U.s. of America.<br />&lt;br&gt;And towards the getting power for which it stands.<br />&lt;br&gt;One cartel, under the stock exchange, insatiable,<br />&lt;br&gt;with affluence and greed for that fortunate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;May Our Flag Always Wave Totally free!&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Since the 9-11 tragedy, the red, white colored and blue American flag continues to be observed on far more cars and flying from a lot more structures than ever before.

Based on organization guru, Brian Tracy, &quot;Leadership could be the most significant single element in determining organization good results or failure in our aggressive, turbulent, fast-moving economy.&quot; Nevertheless not convinced? Based on a research by Jessie Hagen with the US Bank, here are the main factors why organizations fall short:<br /><br />Bad Enterprise <strong>[url= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officiel-airmaxs.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officiel-airmaxs.com</a>]Air Max Pas Cher[/url]</strong> Preparing<br /><br />Very poor Monetary Organizing<br /><br />Bad Marketing<br /><br />Bad Conduite<br /><br />Appropriate software of those important factors is actually a operate of excellent leadership. Let us appear at a number of the conclusions with the US Bank report. In accordance with Hagen's research, within the Business Organizing category, 78% of companies fall short because of insufficient a well-developed company strategy. It boggles my thoughts that numerous folks go into enterprise with no a program, as if it had been the ice cream flavor-of-the-month! Is it any wonder that when I came across the DEA Police &amp; Government auction site of confiscated property, there is really a gleeful statement that declares, &quot;Most organizations fail within their first two years, so chances are, you will come across some relatively new merchandise. At (our) auction, get what you need with out paying full price.&quot;<br /><br />If you just rolled out of bed with a fantastic company idea' and don't want to be a part of this grim statistic, run to your nearest bank, get a free enterprise plan template, and create your plan now! Honor the time-proven cliche, &quot;If you fail to program, you program to fall short.&quot; Leadership is about organizing for good results before it happens. Sun Tzu, the 6th century Chinese philosopher, in his epic work The Art of War, gave some sound enterprise advice that nonetheless applies today: &quot;When your method is deep and far-reaching, then what you gain by your calculations is much, so you can win before you even fight. When your strategic thinking is shallow and near-sighted, then what you gain by your calculations is little, so you lose before you do battle.&quot;<br /><br />In the Monetary Preparing classification, a whopping 82% of corporations failed on account of inadequate cash flow management skills followed closely by starting out with too little money. Enterprise leadership is about taking monetary responsibility, conducting sound financial organizing and investigation, and understanding the unique financial Air Max Pas Cher dynamics of one's organization. Before even starting a business, show your plan to your accountant and get their counsel. What a concept! Asking for the advice of someone who sees the bottom-line realities of enterprise day in and day out; someone who sees the birth certificates, successions, and autopsy reports of thousands of organization entities. It just makes excellent company sense. But many individuals will ignore this advice and eventually meet with company disaster. [Word of caution: don't rely on just one opinion. Get at least two or three opinions from different accountants to get a more informed view].<br /><br />The third company failure aspect profiled within the report, and a critical one, was Promoting. Over 64% from the organizations surveyed in the Marketing and advertising classification failed on account of owners minimizing the importance of properly promoting their business followed by ignoring their competition. Again, like a organization leader, you must be able to effectively communicate your idea to the correct individuals and understand their unique needs and wants. Leadership is all about taking initiative, taking action, getting things done, and making decisions. If you're not doing anything of significance to market and promote your business, you are most likely headed for company failure. I recommend every time you get up inside the morning, jot down 5 new things you can do to promote your business and go DO them! If you can't think of anything to jot down, I highly recommend reading Jay Conrad Levinson's guide, Guerrilla Marketing, which has oodles of useful information and tips on advertising for small organization.<br /><br />Know your competition. Leadership is also about providing value to men and women. If your primary competitors are all providing a better quality and lower priced product than yours, how can you possibly produce any value? Either you harness your strengths to provide different benefits such as speed, convenience, better service; lower your price and improve quality; create a different product for an unmet demand; or get out in the game.<br /><br />Finally, one in the most significant reasons why businesses fail is due to poor management. Inside the Administration category, 70% of <strong>[url= <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.officiel-airmaxs.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.officiel-airmaxs.com</a>]Air Max Pas Cher[/url]</strong> organizations failed on account of owners not recognizing what they don't do nicely and not seeking help, followed by insufficient relevant business experience. Not delegating properly and hiring the wrong people were major contributing factors to enterprise failure inside the Administration class.<br /><br />Leadership is about knowing yourself understanding your strengths and weaknesses. Leaders are aware of their potential. Losers ignore their potential. Leadership is ultimately about influence and delegation. As a leader, you must have the humility to be able to surround yourself with people who are brighter than you and who Air Max can make up for your weaknesses and limitations so you can do what you do best: seize the day and lead!
