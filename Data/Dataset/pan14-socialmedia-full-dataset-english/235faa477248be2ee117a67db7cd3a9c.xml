The proportion for identical twins is even greater, at about sixty to 80 percent opportunity of one having it when the other does.<br /><br />Environmental causes of bipolar <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vZmZpY2lhbGJydWluamVyc2V5c2hvcC5jb20vbWlsYW4tbHVjaWMtamVyc2V5LWMtOC5odG1s" target="_blank">Milan Lucic Jersey</a> condition are much more challenging to evaluate. Bipolar condition continues to be confirmed to possess a chemical foundation in the mind, but the chemical reactions may be caused by any number of elements. A background of losses early in life can be a contributing factor, as can any main source of strain. Physical diseases just like cancer and others can lead to a depressive condition, which can be then normally adopted by mania.<br /><br />Neither genetics nor atmosphere can totally explain the reasons for bipolar disorder.
