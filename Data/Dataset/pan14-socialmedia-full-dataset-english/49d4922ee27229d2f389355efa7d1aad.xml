<br />I SHOULD HAVE  STAYED AT HOME ON A DAY LIKE THAT.HOWEVER,THAT WAS NOT MY DAY.THAT DAY I HAD A TALK WITH ABOUT 200 STUDENTS AT THE DENVER CONFERENCE CENTRE.AND WHEN I LOOKED FOR THE WIRELESS MICROPHONE,I FOUND THAT IT WAS OUT OF BATTERY.HAVING NO CHOICE,I WORE A HIGH_COLLAR COAT ,A SCARF AROUND MY NECK,AND WENT OUT OF HOME.AT THE CORNER OF THE SECOND  LINE OF STREETS,I FOUND THERE WAS A SMALL  DEPARTMENT STORE NEARBY.
<br />IN THE STORE ,THERE WERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE.THE  SALESGIRL WAS A COLOURED GIRL,STANDING AFTER THE CHECK-OUT,WITH   A  CARD ON THE SHIRT,NAMED ROBERTA.IF JUST LOOK OUTSIDE,YOU COULD  QUICKLY JUDGE THAT SHE WAS A SIMPLE GIRL.THE SECOND ONE WAS AN OLD MAN,MAYBE  HE WANTED TO SHELTER FROM THE COLD.HE WANDERED ABOUT GOODS’ STAND,LOOK LIKE NO HURRY.
<br />BUT I HAD NOT MUCH TIME TO CARE FOR A FREE OLD MAN.I NEEDED SOME BATTERIES,AND THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 200 STUDENTS WAITING FOR ME AT THE CONFERENCE CENTRE.WE HAD  MANY THINGS TO DO,AND WE HAD PURPOSES.
<br />AT THE SAME TIME WHEN I INTENDED TO APPROACH THE CHECK_OUT,THE OLD MAN STOOD THERE ALREADY.ROBERTA SMILED.THE OLD MAN SAID NOTHING.ROBERTA TOOK  EACH THINGS WHICH HE CHOSE IN ORDER TO CHARGE  THE CODE INTO MACHINE.I WAS CURIOUS,SO,I LOOKED TO FOLLOW. IT TURNED OUT TO BE THAT THE OLD MAN WALKED ALL A LONG WAY IN A COLD DAY LIKE THAT TO THIS STORE JUST TO BUY A CAKE AND A BANANA!!!WHAT AN ODD!!!
<br />ROBERTA ALREADY FIRGURED OUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY,WHEREAS THE OLD MAN  SLOWLY PUT HIS HANDS INTO THE OLD COAT’S POCKET. “HURRY UP!!!”_I THOUGHT IN MY HEAD_ “YOU MAY BE FREE ALL DAY,BUT I HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO!!!”
<br />THE OLD MAN PULLED A CRUMPLED  PAPER OF MONEY AND SOME COINS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND PUT ON  THE TABLE.ROBERTA SMILED BRIGHTLY AND COLLECTED THAT MONEY AS IF SHE HAD JUST RECEIVED A TREASURE. 
<br />WHEN ROBERTA PUT THE CAKE AND BANANA INTO A NYLON BAG,ONE  MEMORABLE  THING HAPPENED.THE OLD MAN STILL SAID NOTHING,JUST STRECTCHED OUT HIS HAND.THE HANDS WERE SO SKINNY AND SHAKING.ROBERTA GENTLY PUT THE BAG ON HIS ARM_WRIST.AND SHE SMILED MORE BRIGHTLY.

<br />AFTER PUTTING THE SCARF ON HIS NECK,ROBERTA  LOOKED AT HIM AND BLAMED:
<br />“WELL,HOW MANY TIMES DID I TELL YOU TO WEAR WARMLY ENOUGH IF GOING OUTSIDE?I REMINDED YOU TO BE CAREFUL,RIGHT?_ SHE PAUSED A WHILE TO EMPASIZE_I WANT YOU STLL BE FINE WHEN COME BACK TOMORROW”.
<br />THE OLD MAN TOOK THE BAG  AND SLOWLY WENT TO  THE DOOR.
<br />AT THAT MOMENT I REALISED THAT THE OLD MAN CAME THERE NOT TO BUY JUST A CAKE AND A BANANA.HE CAME TO LOOK FOR THE WARMTH.IN THE HEART.
<br />I ASKED ROBERTA:
<br />“IS HE YOUR RELATIVE OR YOUR NEIGHBOUR?”
<br />SHE LOOKED LIKE A BIT OFFENDED WHEN I SUPPOSED THAT SHE ONLY TREATED LIKE THAT WITH RELATIVES OR NEIGHBOURS.TO ROBERTA,OBVIOUSLY,EVERYONE WAS SPECIAL.

<br />You start to think what would happen if you can't see them once again.Will they miss u?Will they remember you?Are they busy and have no time for you?Or they just ignore you?You feel as if you are lost a part of your life,without knowing how to save.
<br />You want to shout : &quot;WHERE ARE YOU?I'M LOST.FIND ME.HOLD ME TIGHT.DON'T LEAVE ME.&quot;

The girl keeps walking from day till night,day after day,but no one notices.Why they can't realize her loneliness? Why they can't walk with her? Why they don't wonder even a little about the girl? Times flies quickly.Sooner or later she has to stop,because she has no energy to keep walking.The girl now turns into an old woman,but she is still alone. All her life she lives in quietness,she lives without the realization of everybody around her.Day after day,she grew older and she hoped she could find the end of the road where she could find a place of her own,a place belonging to her.But after all,she could find nothing,however,she still hopes.She never gives up hope cause she knows God will look at her,poor her,and reward her for her belief.She closes her eyes and falls into sleep,never waking up.She's gone without a sound.She's gone with a smile on her lips and tears on her face.She is in her dream seeking for the end of the road,a place of her own,a man for her life  in heaven. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cry.gif" alt=":)" />

They want to feel safe, they need to be protected, to be cared for, but most of all, they need to know who they are. If you are hated or disliked, you are supposed to lose a stand in your group (family, friends, workplace, neighbors...). Life is complicating. Don't remember how many times I say dissapointing, boring, lonely, and I'm fed up with that. You who read my blog may feel fed up with me also but hiding my feeling won't help it. I need so much a lot of hugs,mais embrasser,merci non. <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/clown.gif" alt=":)" /> I never stops putting questions to matters happening in this life to me, to you, to my beloved ones or to somewhere far away that I just can see in my brain. I never stops wondering whether I'm doing wrong or not, always wondering where the right place I head to. 
<br /><br />How many times you say 'I know'? You know what? Nothing. You just accept it cause that's the fact, that's life, then what's 'life'? Ok, I'm too dumb with all those words and meanings that I learn from book, I learn it hard since I was born, still answers are hidden somewhere. I smile when I hear that word 'Love'. It seems like healing every holes in my brain, compensating for every unanswered questions. But 'love' is also just a word that can be changed quickly. Gosssssssh, I'm so complicated <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" />

Will it be better if time turns back? Sound of a bell wakes me up in middle of my dream. Sitting on the chair in the blue-painted room, looking out from a narrow window full of sunlight, there the kids and happy mothers talking with each other, a green yard, and small houses, i wonder where I am now. For a long time, I did not dream. Funny, dream is not something you can make up or decide but I wish once I can live in my dream if I could have one. Only if time can turn back, I did know what I would do, but only if I could change the present, I would do anything it cost, but there's no 'only if', it makes you feel regrettful, yes, I'm kind like that person, once I did look ahead and now when I am on the verge of breaking down, I am finding back to who I am, but it was covered in the 'past' that my mind did erase somehow. Only if.... time stops now, I could vanish in the air, could I? <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/yinyang.gif" alt=":)" />

The feeling of being in the air, being lifted from the ground, in the middle of air and cloud, hearing the wind, see the mass of the world under your palm, how is that feeling descriable with just few words? The sun comes up and down, then comes the moon and the stars, don't you ever see yourself that close to touch those masterpiece on the airplane? I know I a bit romanticize everything, but if you think not everyone has this chance in their life to see the beauty of our land, the feeling that what is there in the sky, how clouds look like, how my city look like from above? or just thinking you are flying, of course, not with wings but in airplane, is that also a great thing? You can't keep astonished at how marvelous the scenes from above but above all is how beautiful the land under your eyes, it's also a masterpiece, especially when night comes, light shines from neon or buildings or cars,houses, all just brighten up the whole darkness below that like millions candles in night.  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/doh.gif" alt=":)" /> And when being covered by an infinite white clouds, do you ever think of how heaven looks like, maybe like this...Next time, do enjoy your flight thou it's short or long, cause you're flying, and that's the wish of any free person, living as flying <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />Looking back pieces of my memory in each journeys to different countries in Europe, an Asian girl, totally first time exploring the culture and lifestyle of Westerners, I feel myself surprising accustomed to it naturally. There are no words or how to describe exactly what I felt each moment I could experience myself a traveller and an explorer, how amazing and lucky I was to overcome all hardships so that now I can sit here to enjoy looking my photos I took with you. 
<br />You here may be a friend, many friends or maybe a helpful stranger, a companion or a chatter. There is no different in races, skin color, or languages as long as you're open enough to accept the new and looking on bright side of matters, as long as you treat me with your hospitality, I return it back equally, as long as you think of me as a human a person physically as you are, emotional as you are, troublesome like you are, is that so important where I am from? What concerns should be my personality. I always wish I can make a backpack trip with some travelbuddies, 'cause I don't think of travelling to post photos on FB or twitter, I think of it as sincere chances to discover myself, my hidden self, you never know enough of yourself <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> and to enlarge the world you live. I am not a daydreammer, but I know I have some depth in my soul that I need to dig up. 
<br />Instead of seeing people you know, does it surprise you how a stranger can help you that much even you meet him just few moments, how a smile can warm up your fear that much when you even don't know who she is, how a holding can make you cry that much when you even have just few hours with that person, how a night walk be such beautiful with the people you thought you never could get along. When looking back the album, does it remind you how happy you were? is it surprising how you could smile that brightly as if you were the happiest in the world? 
<br />The world is small because we attach each other closer, because we need each other much more dearly, and because we are honest with each other more. This is not fiction, <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/kiss.gif" alt=":)" /> Keep those dear memories in your heart, stamp it in your brain, lock in the photos and widen the smile <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />

The opposite between the easy-going nature with the introversion of a AB blood-type girl born under the star of scorpion makes me feel psychological paralyzed and exhausted with mood changing. It's not like something unprecedented, it's just not simple to make others understand the same way I expect. Sometimes, A total rebel hidden in the surface of the calmness, overwhemed in the sea of emotions without being able to express honestly, afraid to being hurt but desire to being loved crazily, possesive but sympathetic. The constrasting emotions keep me wavering, weak and stupid in making important decisions when it comes to relationships. I want to keep myself safe in my shell, shut down my inner world that hardly anyone knows me well, difficult to accept failure but at the same time desire to have someone break those barriers, though it would not be easy anyway, feeling distant with anybody but at the same time being able to be open with a stranger. And I keep winding the clock time to live in memories kept in photos, in music, in my impressions, in my subconscious. Well, you say, that's totally wasting time. I agree, but if it roots in your personality, it won't change as you wish. Memories are as if the breezes to me, nostalgic, pure, unchanged, and eternal, cause it's stuck in the past and noone could remake. Pictures with friends, with colleagues, with teachers, with family, or myself in any moment is always a treasure to me cause they all passed by me once in my lifetime and the emotions never the same so remember the smile you had today and kept it safely in the closet of memories.
