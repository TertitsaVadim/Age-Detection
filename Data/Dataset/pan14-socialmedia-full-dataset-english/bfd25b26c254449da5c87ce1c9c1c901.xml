<br /><br />In a thrilling encounter Spanish World No. 2 Rafael Nadal will be the Davis Cup teammate and close friend Feliciano Lopez. Prepare for the best tennis in the fast Sunday.
<br /><br />The second-seeded Rafael Nadal of Spain will be his compatriot Feliciano Lopez in order to secure their place in the Australia Open quarterfinals in 2012. He always did well in previous meetings against Lopez, but both are well aware of their strengths and weaknesses and we can expect a brilliant fight when they are together at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia Sunday.
<br /><br />Verdict was roasted even after the 2010 season, and everyone expected him to do the same in 2011, but his knee was the Achilles heel in recent years, the Australia Open quarter-final he lost to compatriot David Ferrer. Although it managed to win three titles after the disaster - all on clay, including the French Open title, but what happened next was amazing, the best tennis to a whole new level - was a large increase Serbian Novak Djokovic. Since then I continued. Djokovic hit Nadal in the final six in 2011 and literally exposed many holes in the armor that the indefatigable Spanish times. He is now time to return on investment - for Nadal, and what may come in the rest of the season - depending on the results of the 2012 Australia Open, when he wanted to set the tone for the challenges ahead. Like a true teacher and student, still focuses on each step that is so advanced, since winning his first Grand Slam at Roland Garros.
<br /><br />Feliciano Lopez, who is currently ranked world No. 19 - he turned pro in 1997 and has two ATP World Tour titles to his credit so far. Currently enjoyed by most of the ATP. 1.1 after the defeat at the start of last season, Lopez has recovered well and reached the quarterfinals in Barcelona and moved to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Face to face Nadal leads 8-2. The last time they met in Rome Masters last year, who beat compatriot Rafael Nadal in straight sets.

<br /><br />Three sets of the Grand Slam in November, No. 2 Rafael Nadal of Spain world to take on the familiar opponent Tomas Berdych when he reached the quarterfinals of the Australia Open tennis great 2012th addition, it is a secret passion for Rafa , Berdych meet the demo we saw at the border on Tuesday.
<br /><br />This is a battle between the Spanish, who is hungrier than ever injured regain the top position and stoic outside, which belongs to the Elite League status in the tennis world again, but many are not over end in the big race - the temperature rises again in the Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday when the World No. 2 Rafael Nadal against world number one Tomas Berdych 7 place in the Australia Open semi-2012th
<br /><br />Although Nadal is ranked World No. 2 in the ATP world rankings between the current situation, the two candidates are alike. Both have a decent afternoon and only lost two games in the last ten games. While Berdych was Bernard Tomic and Nadal Andy Roddick lost his compatriot David Ferrer and Frenchman Gael Monfils in freestyle. So far, this is a good career for two candidates for the Australia Open, but the real challenge begins with this step.
<br /><br />The trial was still cold after the 2010 season, and everyone expects the same way in 2011, but his knee was the Achilles heel of last year's Australia Open quarter-finals, where he lost to compatriot David Ferrer. Although he managed to win three titles this defeat - all on clay, including the French Open title, but what happened next was a bit surprising that the best meeting yet again - there was a sharp increase in the Serbian Novak Djokovic. And that is needed. Nadal beat Djokovic in the last six years, 2011 and, literally, exposed many holes in the armor as a tireless Spanish time. Now is the time to recover - to continue, and what happens in the rest of the season - depends on the results of the 2012 Australia Open, where he set the tone for future challenges. Like a true champion and still a student at each stage of concentration so late, since he won his first Grand Slam at Roland Garros.
<br /><br />On the other hand, the talented Czech Tomas Berdych won six ATP World Tour titles in his career. He achieved his career best ranking of World No. 6 in 2010 after production of certain victory on the road. The Czech Republic has started well last season and reached the semifinals in Chennai and the quarterfinals in Rotterdam. After fighting a great tour for most of last season, has recovered and Berdych won the ATP Beijing.
<br /><br />Face to face is still running 3.10 in the Czech Republic, apparently. The last time last year in Miami Masters quarterfinals Nadal-Berdych in three sets.

Supreme Decree Argentina Federer not only the sixth year in a row to win after winning the U.S. Open title then, and was announced on the big stage - in the melodrama. Now, instead of the semifinals in a game - we can expect some crazy tennis action on Monday when both fighters are working hard together.
<br /><br />It has a relatively easy sailing for two candidates so far in this competition, because both have lost only one match in four games in Melbourne. Federer edges past began to clear and Alexandre Kudryavtsev, sailed into the third round, after a walk through Andreas Beck's talent, and Ivo Karlovic is the dominant and fought and eventually passed local favorite Bernard Tomic.

Reject the quarterfinals on the other hand, Del Potro is more black horse, took a step toward a long period of time - without unnecessary fog on the stage. He reached a career high No. 4 in the world in 2010, the exploits of the U.S. Open, but not in any way, because the injuries were to play their part. Del Potro last year won two ATP World Tour and the ATP-year player to start after bouncing back from the road in style. He led his country into the Davis Cup.

Swiss Ace also has a heated mold after the U.S. Open and has a record of 28-1.
<br /><br />Argentine fled to the 2010 season due to wrist injury, but progress in 2011. Reject the quarterfinals on the other hand, Del Potro is more black horse, took a step toward a long period of time - without unnecessary fog on the stage. He reached a career high No. 4 in the world in 2010, the exploits of the U.S. Open, but not in any way, because the injuries were to play their part. Del Potro last year won two ATP World Tour and the ATP-year player to start after bouncing back from the road in style. He led his country into the Davis Cup.
