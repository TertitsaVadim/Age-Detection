These are harvested in late summer or early autumn with the most common time of 12 months being September and November in the Northern Hemisphere and February and March inside Southern Hemisphere. The quality of grapes is crucial to the products the wine. Grapes are handpicked and transported for a winery and thus begins the wine making process. This process is different for red wine together with white wine, with a brief explanation of each below. <br /><br />Red Wine <br /><br />The first part of making red wine once the grapes have been completely picked is to enable them to be processed in some sort of Crusher Destemmer. The grapes are separated off their stems and crushed to create what is recognized as Must, which is a paste like material. It's then transferred into tanks where they can be left to cold soak for several days. During this time period the must gains colors and flavour. To stop bacteria being created sulphur dioxide is actually added. <br /><br />In addition to the picking of the kiwi, fermentation is the most important part of the wine making process, and therefore comes next. During this stage good sized quantities of yeast is added and a skin is created which floats to the the top barrel. During the rest of the fermentation process this skin color is either punched down on the wine or the wine is pumped over the skin. This is done regularly. Eventually the wine is pressed faraway from the skins into some sort of holding tank where it sits for the sediment to settle out. <br /><br />The final stage of getting red wine is the aging process. The wine is held in oak or redwood barrels to help age. Here oxygen enters and acidity decreases. Wine clarification comes about and the flavour expands. The aging period considerably varies from wine to wine, and once completed it can also be bottled ready for drinking. <br /><br />White Wine <br /><br />Once the grapes have been picked the processing commences. This is done in a Winepress, where the grapes are squeezed for just two hours and then pumped into a tank where the moisture is chilled, resulting in sediment dropping to the bottom so it can be easily removed. <br /><br />Fermentation comes about in Fermentation Vats, which are large tanks. Here, yeast is added along with other ingredients. This is what turns the juice of the grapes into wine. It's then placed into airless vats. It is left to ferment for a period that varies on the kind of wine, and can be as long as one month. Some wines even examine a secondary fermentation. <br /><br />Once fermentation is completed your wine must be left to age. Again, the time it can be left to age for varies this also has an impact in the taste. After this the wine is drawn off to split up the dead yeast cells and also other sediments from the wine that will enter in the bottle. It is then chilled to create more clarification before getting bottled. <br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3NjaWVuY2VzdGFnZS5jb20vZ3JvdXBfaG9tZS5waHA/Z2lkPTQ2ODU4MDE_" target="_blank"> Good information  about wine taste</a>
