<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That no matter how good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that..
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have..
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />You should always leave your loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That sometimes when I'm angry, I have the right to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel..
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That its always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself..
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That the people you care about most in life are taken from you much too soon. 
<br /><br />I Believe..
<br />That no matter how bad your heart is broken, the world doesn't stop for your grief..
<br /><br />And... Always Believe.. God loves you everyday.. 
<br /><br />Cheers.............

And guys.. you can read this to your wife, girlfriend.... and most important is your mum....  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" /> 
<br /><br />A woman has strenghts that amaze men.
<br />She can handle trouble and carry heavy burdens.
<br />She holds happiness, love and opinions.
<br />She smiles when she feels like screaming.
<br />She sings when she feels like crying, cries when she's happy and laughs when she's afraid.
<br />Her love is unconditional!
<br />There's only one this wring with her, she sometimes forgets what she is worth.

<br /><br />anyway, just handover my resignation letter to my boss last week.. currently im working in a so called big company...TTUUTTTTT...(nama company cencored.. haha). But after working for almost 10 months, i realised choosing big company tak janjikan big career or big opportunity.. tapi lebih kepada its open up ur eyes biggg...terkejut skit tgk some ppl prefer to stay at their comfort level for toooo longg... which is i believe is not good for a company..
<br /><br />So, kepada sesiapa yg kerja berbelas belas tahun in a company, its good u r loyal and u contributed to the growth of the company... tapi kepada yg sekadar pergi kerja..balik kerja...tunggu ujung bulan dapat gaji..kasik kerja lebih skit merungut.. cepat wake up.. the company needs you to grow...
