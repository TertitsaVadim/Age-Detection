It is about love and two people. Loving someone can give us the greatest joy we can ever know and it can hurt more than we can believe too. When it does not really hurt when that person did something disappointing to you, but really hurts when you see that person in pain and sadness, then you know you truly love that person.
<br /><br />Loving someone means you should be ready to experience heartache and happiness at the same time. That's the reward and that's the risk. Unless we are willing to experience it, we will never really know what it's like to love and be loved.
<br /><br />Sharing love is probably the most valuable and meaningful experience a person can ever have.
<br /><br />And there's a difference between being in love with someone and loving someone.
<br /><br />It's the difference between a love that's fickle, wild and short-lived and one that's tender and passionate, nurturing and lasts a long time.
<br /><br />The first is easy. The second, the one that really matters to all of us, takes work -- because it's about keeping a relationship.
<br /><br />Loving someone takes efforts. We have to be able to communicate with each other. Nobody can read anyone else's mind. We always presume that our partner knows what we think and feel. Maybe in time we might be able to predict or sense each other's thoughts but it's never perfect and takes time to develop.
<br /><br />Getting the chance to love and be loved by someone is blessed.
<br /><br />Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not what you want him/her to be.
<br /><br />Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way. No one is perfect. It is true love which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth surface of acceptance for each other. True love sees and accepts a person for who he/she is. It is also true love which makes a person change for the better.
<br /><br />The power of true love to a person is undeniable.
<br /><br />A relationship needs commitments too. What is love without commitments from each other anyway? It's like principles and values. Everyone has them but they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them.
<br /><br />The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we love. &quot;Love is like an antique vase. It's hard to find, hard to get, but easy to break.&quot;
<br /><br />Every day everywhere, people fall in love ... but just how many of these relationships are self-sacrificing love, and not just relationships which are formed only for the intense feeling of falling in love? I know hundreds of friends who say the magical words &quot;I love you&quot;... but more often than not, the truth is just -- &quot;I am IN love with you&quot;.
<br /><br />There is a difference between being in love with someone and loving someone. If a person says he/she is in love with you, he/she means that he/she likes you for who you are now and he/she fell in love with you because of the present you. This kind of love is temporary and lasts only as long as the fairytale lasts. When fairy godmother comes in at midnight to whirl us back to reality, we see the heartache of such a relationship... where both were only IN love with each other.
<br /><br />But if a person says he/she loves you, he/she means that he/she loves you unconditionally for who you are now, who you were in the past and who you might be in the future. When he/she says he/she loves you and really means it, you have to ask yourself if you love him/her too or if you're in love with the idea of being in love. It is very hard to see the difference through logical thinking.
<br /><br />Let your heart guide you.

Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forward. Everthing in life is temporary, so if the things are going good, enjoy it because it would not last forever. And if the things are going bad, do not worry, because it would not last forever, either destiny is not a matter of chance but it's a matter of choice, it is not a thing to be regret of but rather a life to be enjoyed with... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/tongue.gif" alt=":)" /> <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />you catch it like the flu,
<br />When someone smiled at me today,
<br />I started smiling too.
<br /><br />I passed around the corner
<br />and someone saw my grin.
<br />When he smiled I realized
<br />I'd passed it on to him.
<br /><br />I thought about that smile,
<br />then I realized its worth.
<br />A single smile, just like mine
<br />could travel round the earth.
<br /><br />So, if you feel a smile begin,
<br />don't leave it undetected.
<br />Let's start an epidemic quick,
<br />and get the world infected

<br />Do you ever feel out of place?
<br />Like somehow you just don't belong
<br />And no one understands you
<br />Do you ever wanna runaway?
<br />Do you lock yourself in your room?
<br />With the radio on turned up so loud 
<br />That no one hears you screaming
<br /><br />No you don't know what it's like
<br />When nothing feels all right
<br />You don't know what it's like
<br />To be like me
<br /><br />To be hurt
<br />To feel lost
<br />To be left out in the dark
<br />To be kicked when you're down
<br />To feel like you've been pushed around
<br />To be on the edge of breaking down
<br />And no one's there to save you 
<br />No you don't know what it's like
<br />Welcome to my life
<br /><br />Do you wanna be somebody else?
<br />Are you sick of feeling so left out?
<br />Are you desperate to find something more?
<br />Before your life is over
<br />Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
<br />Are you sick of everyone around?
<br />With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
<br />While deep inside you're bleeding
<br /><br />No one ever lied straight to your face
<br />No one ever stabbed you in the back
<br />You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be okay
<br />Everybody always gave you what you wanted
<br />Never had to work it was always there
<br />You don't know what it's like
<br />welcome 2 my lyf

<br /><br />“A true Arab knows how to catch a fly in his hands,”
<br />my father would say. And he’d prove it,
<br />cupping the buzzer instantly
<br />while the host with the swatter stared.
<br /><br />In the spring our palms peeled like snakes.
<br />True Arabs believed watermelon could heal fifty ways.
<br />I changed these to fit the occasion.
<br /><br />Years before, a girl knocked,
<br />wanted to see the Arab.
<br />I said we didn’t have one.
<br />After that, my father told me who he was,
<br />“Shihab”–”shooting star”–
<br />a good name, borrowed from the sky.
<br />Once I said, “When we die, we give it back?”
<br />He said that’s what a true Arab would say.
<br /><br />Today the headlines clot in my blood.
<br />A little Palestinian dangles a truck on the front page.
<br />Homeless fig, this tragedy with a terrible root
<br />is too big for us. What flag can we wave?
<br />I wave the flag of stone and seed,
<br />table mat stitched in blue.
<br /><br />I call my father, we talk around the news.
<br />It is too much for him,
<br />neither of his two languages can reach it.
<br />I drive into the country to find sheep, cows,
<br />to plead with the air:
<br />Who calls anyone civilized?
<br />Where can the crying heart graze?
<br />What does a true Arab do now?
<br /><br />-”Blood” by Naomi Shihab Nye

<br />I had too much to do.
<br />I had to hurry and get to work
<br />For bills would soon be due.
<br />So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,
<br />And jumped up off my knees.
<br />My Christian duty was now done
<br />My soul could rest at ease.....
<br />All day long I had no time
<br />To spread a word of cheer
<br />No time to ! speak of Christ to friends,
<br />They'd laugh at me I'd fear.
<br />No time, no time, too much to do,
<br />That was my constant cry,
<br />No time to give to souls in need
<br />But at last the time, the time to die.
<br />I went before the Lord,
<br />I came, I stood with downcast eyes.
<br />For in his hands God! ! held a book;
<br />It was the book of life.
<br />God looked into his book and said
<br />&quot;Your name I cannot find
<br />I once was going to write it down...
<br />But never found the time&quot;
<br /><br />Now do you have the time 
<br />to pass it on?

<br /><br />&quot;Because I'm a woman,&quot; she told him. 
<br /><br />&quot;I don't understand,&quot; he said. 
<br /><br />His Mom just hugged him and said, 
<br /><br />&quot;And you never will.&quot; 
<br /><br />Later the little boy asked his father, &quot;Why does 
<br /><br />mother seem to cry for no reason?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;All women cry for no reason,&quot; was all his 
<br /><br />dad could say. 
<br /><br />The little boy grew up and became a man, still 
<br /><br />wondering why women cry. 
<br /><br />Finally he put prayed to God who would surely know the answer. 
<br /><br />When God responded he asked, &quot;God, why do women cry so easily?&quot; 
<br /><br />God said: &quot;When I made the woman she had to be to be made special. I made 
<br /><br />her shoulders 
<br /><br />strong enough to carry the weight of the world, yet 
<br /><br />gentle enough to give comfort. I gave her an inner strength to endure 
<br /><br />childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children. I 
<br /><br />gave her 
<br /><br />a hardness that allows 
<br /><br />her to keep going when everyone else gives up, and 
<br /><br />take care of her family 
<br /><br />through sickness and fatigue without complaining. 
<br /><br />gave her the sensitivity 
<br /><br />to love her children under any and all 
<br /><br />circumstances, even when her child 
<br /><br />has hurt her very badly. I gave her strength to 
<br /><br />carry her husband through 
<br /><br />his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect 
<br /><br />his heart. 
<br /><br />I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his 
<br /><br />wife, but sometimes tests 
<br /><br />her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly. 
<br /><br />And lastly, I gave her a tear to shed. This is hers and only hers 
<br /><br />exclusively to use whenever she needs it. 
<br /><br />She needs no reason, no explanation, its hers.&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;You see my son,&quot; said God, &quot;the beauty of a woman 
<br /><br />is not in the clothes she 
<br /><br />wears, the figure that she carries, or the way she 
<br /><br />combs her hair. The 
<br /><br />beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes, because 
<br /><br />that is the doorway to 
<br /><br />her heart - the place where love resides.&quot; 
<br /><br />Be proud you are a woman!The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.....
