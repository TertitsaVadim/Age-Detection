<br />it is only the beginning when friendships are close and dreams are far, 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />Tears fill me with memories of both good and bad 
<br />some nearly forgotten yet all dear to the heart, 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />In times of trouble and in times of thanks you stood by my side and held me up. 
<br />Through your ever-patient ears to your comforting hugs 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />From that first day when I saw you and knew that you would love me for who I was, 
<br />you were there for me. 
<br />And until the day when we are old and gray I will always know that, 
<br />you are there for me.

<br />but it hurts more than anything.
<br />I used to think that we would end up together no matter what,
<br />but lately I'm not so sure.
<br />I can't think of one person who isn't trying to tear us apart and make sure that we never end up together.
<br />No one wants me with you, they think you will hurt me, but I truly don't see it!!
<br />They think that you're the reason I cry....and you are but that's only cause I can't be with you, touch you, and hold you.
<br />They don't know that they are the ones hurting me! And Ive been hurt so much before that.
<br />Its like nothing can go right in my life, I can never have what I truly want and Love!!
<br /><br />That's life I guess!

<br />to that place I long to be.
<br />Take my hand and trust my way,
<br />in that place forever stay.
<br />Follow me toward the sand,
<br />we'll run and play, hand in hand.
<br />Take my heart and hold it true;
<br />forever I'll stay close to you.
<br />Seize my words and listen well,

<br />Release your heart and feelings too,
<br />just as I will do for you.
<br />Trust your heart and follow me,
<br />to that place we long to be.

<br />when will I find you?
<br />Day after day passes by,
<br />and still I catch no sign of you.
<br />The one who I'm 
<br />destined to love,
<br />you are invisible to me.
<br /><br />My heart yearns to feel your love.
<br />My eyes long to see your face.
<br />My body aches to feel your arms around me.
<br />My lips shiver in anticipation
<br />to feel your lips on mine.
<br />Yet I do not even know you.
<br /><br />My love, my dearest,
<br />I can't wait till you're mine.
<br />My love, my dearest,
<br />without the hope of meeting you,
<br />I'd die.
<br /><br />my heart beats fast
<br />whenever I think of you.
<br />My breath grows short
<br />while I dream of you.
<br />My body aches for you.
<br />My life is a lonely is a lonely abyss
<br />without your presence.
<br /><br />I do not know you,
<br />but I can hear your voice
<br />sometimes in my dreams.
<br />The question always 
<br />runs through my mind,
<br />&quot;Do I already know you?&quot;
<br />Can the love of my life
<br />be someone i already know?
<br />I do not know you,
<br />but I can see you
<br />sometimes in my dreams.
<br />I do not know you,
<br />but I can feel you beside me
<br />sometimes while I sleep.

<br />Just takes me away...
<br />Back to a time way back.
<br /><br />Back when charming princes
<br />In shining armor, on white horses,
<br />Flourished, their swords,
<br />Making the princesses swoon.
<br /><br />You do that to me,
<br />Make me laugh, and fret,
<br />And swoon, on occasion.
<br /><br />But without a sword,
<br />Or a great white horse,
<br />Or armor,
<br />You are still a prince.
<br /><br />And my prince,
<br />Whom I'd swoon over,
<br />Any day.

<br />Then my heart knows not what is right,
<br />I cry myself to sleep,
<br />Every second of the night
<br />What is there to do?
<br />What is there to say?
<br />I know I can't have you
<br />But still I give my heart away,
<br /><br />I’d walk a thousand miles
<br />And cry a thousand tears
<br />Just to know your love
<br />Will be waiting for me
<br />But what is there to feel?
<br />When you don’t feel the same?
<br />I know I can’t have you
<br />But still I give my love away,
<br /><br />You are my dream come true
<br />I wished upon a star for you
<br />But what am I to know?
<br />If you really love me so
<br />I know I can’t have you
<br />But still I give myself away

<br />there is but one voice
<br />capturing the moment
<br />captivating and controlling
<br />the thoughts, actions, words
<br />leading the way for conscious
<br />desire and decisive emotion
<br /><br />stories and daily goings- on
<br />are frequently passed
<br />between the one voice
<br />and the intermixed beings
<br />creating a warm happiness
<br />a sense of belonging
<br />an aura of completeness
<br />a comfortable existence
<br /><br />time, a distant memory
<br />fading in and fading out,
<br />its power and autonomy fall
<br />on blissfully ignorant,
<br />yet distinctly aware,
<br />ears - focused and true
<br /><br />with the quantity
<br />of well spent hours
<br />adding up and summarizing
<br />the feelings and beliefs
<br />shared and opposed,
<br />comes an ability
<br />to confide and uphold
<br />moments, eternities
<br />abundant with understanding.

<br />Your touch a cool caress
<br />I am lost in your magic
<br />My heart beats within your chest
<br /><br />I think of you each morning
<br />And dream of you each night
<br />I think of your arms being around me
<br />And cannot express my delight
<br /><br />Never have I fallen
<br />But I am quickly on my way
<br />You hold a heart in your hands
<br />That has never before been given away

<br />O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you, that ye may (learn) self-restraint
<br /><br />2:184 (Fasting) for a fixed number of days; but if any of you is ill, or on a journey, the prescribed number (should be made up) from days later. For those who can do it (with hardship), is a ransom, the feeding of one that is indigent. But he that will give more, of his own free will, it is better for him. And it is better for you that ye fast, if ye only knew.
