<br />Universal Laws of Karmas (Punya and Pap) on Life.
<br />PUNYA AND PAP
<br />Why are some people in more favorable situations than the others? Why are some rich, while the others struggle?
<br /><br />Why do some suffer more sickness than the others?Why is science unable to explain all these questions?
<br /><br />The answer to such a disparity lies in the understanding of the punya and the pap. What are the punya and the pap?A punya is earned when our activities are good and comforting to others while a pap is earned when our activities are bad and cause suffering to the others. When the punya mature or give the result, it brings worldly happiness and comfort, and when the pap mature or give the result, it brings nothing but the worldly suffering.
<br />Now, it would be obvious that what we see in the world is nothing other than the result of our past actions.Knowing this would remind us that our activities should be wholesome if we want happiness and comfort in life,otherwise we should be ready to accept the unhappiness and discomfort. When talking about the activities, people mostly think of physical activities, but we should not forget that verbal expressions,and mental thoughts are also considered the activities.For this reason, not only our physical activities be wholesome,but our speech and thoughts should also be pure.
<br />We should also remember that we accumulate punya and pap (karmas) by asking someone else to do something for us or by encouraging someone else to do something.Lord Mahavira’s message is &quot;Live and let live&quot;. Everybody desires to live and enjoy the comforts of life.
<br />Therefore, we should not come in the way of anyone seeking the same.If we can properly understand the implications of this message, it will go long way in molding our attitude towards other creatures.But, around us we see and hear that many people hunt or fish and they eat meat, chicken, fish, eggs, etc. Some meat eating people argue that they do not actually kill animals or these creatures were created for our food.Therefore, eating meat or other animals foods would not affect them.However, they do not realize that by eating meat or other animal foods they are directly or indirectly instrumental in killing animals, birds, fish, etc., The more they eat, the more killing there will be.They are not realizing that their direct as well as indirect actions bring pap or punya. Unfortunately,because most of paps do not show their results immediately,the people do not care about the consequences.We also hear about the riots in which people plunder, hit, and kill the others and set fire to the shops,the homes, and buildings.By doing so, they put a lot of people through unnecessary suffering.These people undertaking such heinous activities may think that they are getting even;however,they fail to realize that by causing suffering to others they themselves will have to suffer the consequences of their evil acts at some point,if not in this life,then in coming lives. Consequently,our actions should not involve disturbing the comforts of other living beings,hurting or killing them in any way, directly or indirectly. By providing comfort and security to others,we gain punya. Punya brings happiness during this life or following lives.On the other hand, if we cause suffering or unhappiness to the others then we acquire Pap.Such Pap brings the unhappiness in this or future lives. The following is a list of some activities that can bring comfort to others and can ultimately provide the same for us.They are:
<br /><br />1) offering food to the needy (only vegetarian food) 
<br /><br />2) offering clothes to the needy 
<br /><br />3) helping the sick
<br /><br />4) helping others to acquire knowledge
<br /><br />5) giving charity (be sure that the money is used for a good cause)
<br /><br />6) helping parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, and others in need
<br /><br />7) helping animals or organizations that help animals
<br /><br />8) studying religion and following its precepts in our daily lives
<br /><br />9)Chanting Gayatri Mantra Daily 
<br /><br />Here is a list of some of the activities that can cause discomfort to others and can ultimately cause discomfort to us. They are:
<br /><br />1) being cruel or violent to the others including the humans, animals, birds, bugs, etc.
<br /><br />2) killing the humans, animals, birds, bugs, etc.
<br /><br />3) showing disrespect to parents, teachers or others
<br /><br />4) speaking harsh words or planning violence
<br /><br />5) not following the religious principles in the daily life
<br /><br />6) being angry or greedy
<br /><br />7) being arrogant
<br /><br />8) to be deceptive.

<br />‘Devnar’ is a combination of two words DEV (God) and NAR (Man), highlighting the fact that there is God in every man. If the entire humanity is the family of God, the visually challenged children are special members in it. And so, they should be given every possible opportunity to develop their potentialities and latent talents. Devnar Foundation tries to unleash the incredible capacity of students by giving them value based education thus enabling them to realize that within them can be found the skill, knowledge and motivation to make something special happen. The Foundation aims to provide opportunities on par with international standards for the visually challenged children in India so that they can be absorbed in the mainstream of society as socially productive individuals. In Devnar School, education, boarding and lodging are absolutely free and any Visually Challenged child is admitted during any part of the year. 
<br />Devnar Foundation was established on 1-11-1991 with Regn.no.1191/91 with four students in a rented room. Within a span of 17 years, the school has grown to the present stature with 350 students, housed in a three storeyed building owned by the Foundation. This phenomenal growth is due to the undoubted ability and unflinching enthusiasm of the founder and his wife, the dedicated staff, many philanthropists and donors. Devnar School is now acclaimed as the best institution for the Visually Challenged in India with the students aspiring to reach lofty heights of achievement, hitherto thought impossible for such children.
<br /><br />Devnar School was founded in 1992 by Dr. A. Saibaba Goud, a leading Ophthalmologist of India who is also the recipient of Dr. B.C. Roy National Award in 2004 for his outstanding services in the field of social medical relief. There is a steady influx of visitors to the school. Politicians and pressmen, beauty queens and bureaucrats, scientists and sportsmen, philanthropists and film stars come and meet the students. Some of them struggle to keep back the tears at first, but after interacting with them, it is not tears of pity they shed, but tears of admiration. Devnar School provides all that is necessary to bring out the best in the students. Their abilities outshine the disability to such an extent that the visitors leave the school humbled by the unconquerable spirit, perseverance and performance of the students. Some of the contributory factors for this phenomenal success are listed here:
<br />OUR FOUNDER AND MANAGING TRUSTEE

<br /><br />Since its independence, the issue of poverty within India has remained a prevalent concern. As of 2010, more than 37% of India’s population of 1.35 billion still lives below the poverty line. More than 22% of the entire rural population and 15% of the urban population of India exists in this difficult physical and financial predicament. 
<br />Poverty Situation
<br /><br />The division of resources, as well as wealth, is uneven in India - this disparity creates different poverty ratios for different states. For instance, states such as Delhi and Punjab have low poverty ratios. On the other hand, almost half the population in states like Bihar and Orissa live below the poverty line.
<br /><br />A number of factors are responsible for poverty in the rural areas of India. Rural populations primarily depend on agriculture, which is highly dependant on rain patterns and the monsoon season. Inadequate rain and improper irrigation facilities can obviously cause low, or in some cases, zero production of crops.
<br /><br />Additionally, the Indian family unit is often large, which can amplify the effects of poverty. Also, the caste system still prevails in India, and this is a major reason for rural poverty - people from the lower casts are often deprived of the most basic facilities and opportunities.
<br /><br />We are the trying to help poor and needy people and also help to stand on his own leg for income.We donate free food,daily needs,give treatment and medicine,free books to poor childrens, etc. and all those thing want money but we try to give our best and with your kind help we do much better and bigger than now.So kindly donate to enable us to help more peoples of India.
