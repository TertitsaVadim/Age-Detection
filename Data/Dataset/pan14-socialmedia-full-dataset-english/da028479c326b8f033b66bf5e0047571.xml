There are a lot of methods and technology for purchase today to whiten teeth. Using these tips can help whiten your smile fast and easily.<br />&lt;img src=&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.static.flickr.com%2F8030%2F8021919368_f942b91917.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8030/8021919368_f942b91917.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; style=&quot;padding:10px;&quot;/&gt;<br /><br />Lemon and lime juice, despite what people say, are not good ways to whiten your teeth. You should really avoid them completely. The acid content in them may wear away the tooth enamel, which causes more discoloration as well as cavities.<br /><br />Drink as little coffee and dark tea as possible, and quit smoking. These items can have a hand in discoloring your smile! If you can't live without tea or coffee, use a straw to drink it, keep your lips covering your front teeth, or brush teeth immediately after your drink is finished. The leading causes of ugly, discolored teeth are strongly colored beverages and tobacco.<br /><br />Drinking through a straw is one of the many small tricks that can help maintain whiter teeth. Using this tool will aid in keeping the liquids from remaining on your teeth for a long period of time. The straw directs the liquid toward the back of your mouth, causing it to interact with your teeth only minimally.<br /><br />You should be careful of what beverages you consume if you want your teeth to be whiter. Drinks like red wine and coffee can stain your teeth. One way to minimize the stains, is to use a straw when drinking these kinds of beverages.<br /><br />Working on bad breath problems can be beneficial to whitening your smile. First, determine whether or not you have bad breath by licking your clean palm. If you do have an unpleasant odor you should use some mouthwash or a breath mint. Always be certain that your mouthwash is free of alcohol, as it can have a drying effect.<br /><br />Do not bleach or whiten your teeth if you're nursing or pregnant. This is because your gums tend to be a lot more sensitive whenever you are pregnant or nursing. Teeth whiting products also contain chemicals that could harm you. Avoid using a commercial whitener while pregnant or nursing.<br /><br />Speak with your dentist about a whitening gel that can be taken home and applied. The dentist can build a mouthpiece that contains special teeth whitening gel. You then wear this mouth piece a couple of hours each evening for 14 to 21 days. Using this method, you can get teeth that are about eight shades whiter.<br /><br />Orange peels are an effective home remedy for stained and yellow teeth. Rub your teeth and gums with the inner part of the peel to keep your teeth white. A paste for brushing your teeth can also be made by mixing up dried orange peels and ground bay leaves together. Be sure to thoroughly rinse your mouth after use to get rid of the sugar from the fruit.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, getting whiter teeth can be costly and hard to do. While this is true for some methods, there are many easy teeth whitening procedures out there that don't have to cost a fortune. From the suggestions in the article, you can find whitening methods that you can use at home without visiting the dentist.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2FydGh1cmhjb3Vsc29uNC5saXZlam91cm5hbC5jb20vMzAwMC5odG1s" target="_blank">Dental Clinic Delhi - How To Get Natural Teeth Whitening At Home</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56b290b28uY29tL3Byb2ZpbGUvRGV2b25GQ29ubmVyMjQvYmxvZy9lbnRyeS9wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWx2c25hdHVyYWx0ZWV0aHdoaXQ_" target="_blank">Natural Teeth Whitening That You Can Do At Home</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pYW1zcG9ydC5vcmcvcGcvYmxvZy9BbGxhblBCZWFtZTQvcmVhZC8xMDUzNzIwMC9uYXR1cmFsLXRlZXRoLXdoaXRlbmluZy1hdC1ob3VzZS1zdWdnZXN0aW9ucw__" target="_blank">The Truth About Natural Teeth Whitening Methods</a>

You can actually get other infections in your body if you get cavities or gingivitis in your teeth that you neglect. It really isn't that hard to keep your teeth healthy. If you want to have healthy clean teeth, it is up to you to utilize the following strategies and tactics for improving or maintaining your dental health (plus stay away from the dentist!).<br /><br />One of the most basic mistakes many people make when it comes to taking care of their teeth is simply not brushing long enough. We may only brush for a second or two because we are in a hurry to get finished. Anyone that brushes for two minutes, or longer, is actually complying with what dentists will instruct you to do today. You can actually buy an electric toothbrush which will help you eliminate the monotony that usually comes with brushing. Brushing your teeth will be much more tolerable. You will probably brush for longer, plus reach spots you would not have otherwise. Kids will brush for longer than normal with an electric toothbrush simply because they will like it more. It is definitely true for adults, as it is for children. <br /><br />In India, people have traditionally kept their teeth clean using products made from the neem tree. The neem tree -- leaves, twigs, bark -- has been found to be a natural antiseptic. Neem twigs continue to be used today and you can buy them in online stores and a number of health food stores. You may not exactly be excited about brushing your teeth with a twig. There's another way you could experience the benefits of neem. You'll find many natural toothpastes having neem as an ingredient.<br /><br />You can naturally and safely clean your teeth and avoid gum disease. In some natural toothpastes, neem is combined with a few other healing herbs.<br /><br />Avoid acidic drinks because they can damage your teeth. We know that soft drinks aren't good drinks anyway, but here's another reason to avoid them: they'll stain the teeth and erode the enamel. You'll need to avoid sports drink too, and some studies have found that they're a lot worse than soda. The acid and sugar concentration in sports drink is very high. As much as possible, avoid fruit juices as well because they have a high sugar and acid content which can harm your teeth. You are better off eating fruit, which is actually beneficial to your teeth. The acid and sugar content in fruit juices are a lot more concentrated and this explains why they aren't good for your teeth. If you can't completely eliminate these beverages from your diet, the least you can do is rinse your mouth after. <br /><br />There are many good reasons to keep your teeth and gums clean. Your smile would be brighter, of course, if you have whiter teeth, but maintaining your dental health will protect you from developing certain illnesses. Moreover, you won't have to undergo dental procedures that are complicated and costly. So you need to do everything you can to take good care of your teeth and gums.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/garretemilio/blog/blogid=12332124" target="_blank">Having A Brighter Smile Through Teeth Whitening</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL0FsZWNOQmFybmVzMzAuYnJhdmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRyeS8xMTAxMTc_" target="_blank">How To Get Whiter Teeth Quickly And Easily</a>, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2JyYWRlbm5jb3NoMjIucG9zdGVyb3VzLmNvbS9oYXZpbmctYS1icmlnaHRlci1zbWlsZS10aHJvdWdoLXRlZXRoLXdoaXRlbmk_" target="_blank">Have The Teeth You've Always Wanted With These Teeth Whitening Ideas</a>

Don't despair if you are afraid to show your stained teeth, there is still hope! You have literally dozens of different teeth whitening products at your disposal. You can use a home whitening treatment or go get them professionally done, either way you have options.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5naWdhc2l6ZS5jb20vdXBsb2FkY29tcGxldGUvTFMwPQ__" target="_blank">Enhance Your Looks And Get Whiter Teeth Now</a> When you have gingivitis or unfilled cavities are present, you should not whiten your teeth. These conditions require care, so you have to make sure you don't exacerbate them by treating your teeth with whitening agents. Before you use any home teeth whitening process, be sure to get your dentist's approval.<br /><br />If you want whiter teeth, you might have to eliminate or reduce your daily intake of coffee. Many people love their coffee, but it is one of the beverages most responsible for making teeth yellow. If you drink it consistently, you are providing a constant failure for any teeth whitening process you're working on. Consider drinking hot chocolate instead of coffee.<br /><br />Use a consistent plan of action for long-term success when trying to achieve a whiter smile. Be careful about the foods and beverages you consume, use the right cleaning products on your teeth and have regular dental checkups in order to keep your teeth white. Consistency in your behavior will keep your smile bright.<br /><br />If you have been diagnosed with cavities or any form of gum disease, you must avoid whiteners that use bleach. This can cause further pain and damage your mouth, and you do not want or need to do that. Discuss the alternatives with your dentist to discover what options may be available for your particular circumstances.<br /><br />If you experience any pain or discomfort while using a home teeth whitening product, be sure to discontinue using it right away. You can increase your sensitivity and cause inflammation by using whitening products. Consult your dentist if you experience new sensitivity, inflammation, pain or discomfort.<br /><br />Avoid consuming dark foods and drinks, which can leave stains on your teeth. Berries that have high blue and black content are very bad for staining. Coffee and soda are also likely culprits. This can help your teeth stop from needing whitening in the first place.<br /><br />Use a quality toothbrush that's right for you. Ask your dentist to recommend a toothbrush to you, so that you know what to buy.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3N0b3JhZ2VzdGFydC5kaXZzaGFyZS5jb20vbGF1bmNoLnBocD9mPTIwMjA1NTAzJmFtcDtzPWVlOA__" target="_blank">Great Tips For Gaining Your Whitest Smile</a>    &lt;img src=&quot;<br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm9.static.flickr.com%2F8189%2F8124379802_be9d19ffe9.jpg%26quot"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8189/8124379802_be9d19ffe9.jpg&quot</a>; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;248&quot; style=&quot;padding:10px;&quot;/&gt; For an easy, cost-effective tooth whitener, mix some baking soda in water.
