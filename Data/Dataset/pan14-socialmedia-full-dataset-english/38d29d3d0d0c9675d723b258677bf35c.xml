Looking into a destination personally is very important as you will be able to choose the destination that will be most rewarding to you. The reason as to why someone should be careful in the decision making process is because we all have different tastes and preferences and so one person’s idea of a perfect destination is not necessarily the idea of the other. Making a decision carefully is therefore paramount to enjoying a holiday.
<br /><br />Spain is one of the great tourist destinations. This owes to the fact that Spain is very diverse in her resources thus in a way, Spain has something for everyone. It is a perfect destination for family holidays as there are areas that are children friendly.

Accessible tourism is basically whereby barriers are removed so that everyone is able to move in and out of the destinations in Spain.
<br /><br />There are catalogues written in Braille so as to give assistance to the blind. The deaf and dumb are also catered for by the ever present tour guides that operate in sign language. Some of the audiovisual presentations also incorporate sign language to further assist the deaf. For people on wheelchairs, the removals of barriers in most locations in Spain have gone a long way in helping them gain access to the areas of interest. There are however some places that still need to be upgraded so as to allow for accessible tourism.
<br /><br />For those people that take a fancy in the environment, there is highly developed ecotourism in Spain. This involves the existence of many botanical gardens that facilitate ecotourism to a great extent. People get the chance to tour the gardens and learn a lot from the surroundings.
<br /><br />Historians as well as scholars also have a great chance of learning a lot of things in Spain.

This large rectangular building was built during the Renaissance but its exterior poses like a harsh prison rather than a palace.
<br /><br />This special monument was built between 1563 and 1584 by Juan Bautista Toledo. Felipe II planned it as a mausoleum cum monastery when he expressed a desire to spend his life like a monk. 
<br /><br />Later monarchs transformed the drab-looking monument interiors with rich décor in keeping with their affluent lifestyles. However, Felipe’s personal rooms were left untouched as when he passed away. His favorite bed and support chair remained in his room where he used to look out to the courtyard and quaint chapel where Masses were held.
<br /><br />Gastronomy
<br /><br />Besides local historical attractions, El Escorial has many interesting nooks and corners for scrumptious local delicacies. There are plenty of good restaurants serving delightful local cuisines besides the fancy and upper class restaurants found in hotels.
<br /><br />There are many types of sumptuous food at El Escorial. One of the more delightful local dishes is the stews which are made of traditional secret recipes. The fish is another popular choice among the locals at El Escorial. These tantalizing local dishes usually go well with the fine local wines available from the region’s best vineyards. Bocadillo is another preferred choice to go with the local cuisine.
<br /><br />Tourists are delighted at these treats as they are not only easily available but also affordable.  With the plethora of pubs and bars in El Escorial, the locals and tourists have no problem enjoying the town and its region anytime for food or drinks.
<br /><br />Great holiday option
<br /><br />El Escorial may not be considered a city but it still offers several cinemas to entertain the locals and tourists in town. Numerous theatrical mementoes are performed depending on the demand of the crowd; jazz and classical concerts are frequently performed at the local Coliseo which dates back to 18th century.  
<br /><br />Numerous theatrical productions are available throughout the year with a free weekly performance.
<br /><br />El Escorial is a great holiday vacation choice from the myriad of holiday packages available. The itinerary includes visiting the historical basilica, famous monastery, royal apartments, chapter houses, sacristy and public library.

		<document id="cde046830ff2f8abc62d2aefe9bc7fac" url=""><![CDATA[Enjoying Beach Holidays In Spain<br/><br/>One of the first types of tourism to be developed in Spain was beach tourism. This was during the summer time when other European countries were experiencing some really cold periods. They then discovered how fair the weather in Spain was and so they world leave their own countries during the cold seasons and move to Spain so as to enjoy the sun and beaches in the country.
<br /><br />A lot of facilities were put up along the coastline as well as in the island destinations so as to be able to meet the growing need for accommodation and restaurants for the tourists. More things were discovered in Spain after a while making the region becoming even more popular. 
<br /><br />Spain beaches are many. They are more than 4,000 kilometers in length. The beaches are connected to the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west, Bay of Biscay in the north, as well as the Mediterranean Sea on the southern and eastern franks. This clearly explains why the country has such a wide area of beaches. 
<br /><br />The weather in Spain goes a long way in making beach tourism a success. This is because the country enjoys over 300 hundred days of sunshine in a year. This is quite something as compared to other European countries. The beaches enjoy the sun most as they receive many tourists every year. 
<br /><br />Costa Brava is one of the most popular regions in Spain. It is sculpted by the Mediterranean Sea. There are some scenic coves and very beautiful beaches in the region. Other areas affiliated to the Mediterranean Sea include Costa Calida, Costa Blanca, Costa de Valencia, Costa del Azahar and Costa Daurada. 
<br /><br />In Andalusia, there are beach destinations too. Some of the most popular ones include Costa del Sol, Costa Tropical, and Costa de Almeria. These are the best places for anyone who wants to have a great time at the beach as well as entertainment and leisure facilities. Marbella attracts many celebrities as it is considered as a holiday capital. It is an up market resort.
<br /><br />The link between Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean is the strait of Gibraltar. One may even see the African coast when the day is clear. 
<br /><br />The Bay of Biscay creates a spectacular stretch which is quite impressive. Cities in the area include Donostia-san Sebastian, Santander and Gijon. The beaches have natural backdrops. It is a tourist hotspot in Spain.
<br /><br />All the beaches and facilities that are available make the region one of the most popular places on earth that attract many tourists each year.

The coast belongs to Girona which is one of the provinces. The area covered is 214 kilometers from Costa del Maresme to the French border. 
<br /><br />Costa Brava actually means wild coast. This name may be in relation to parts of the coastline that are rocky. However, beautiful bays are also found in the area making the perfect place for holidays as resorts have been put up. 
<br /><br />In the 20th century, the only things seen in the area were fishing villages that were quite small. The natural beauty of the region attracted many artists to the region. They included Salvador Dali, Rusinol, Picasso and Marc Chagall. 
<br /><br />The 1950’s saw more tourists come to the coastal area. In the 60’s, the small fishing villages were quickly transformed into tourist centers. In the present day, areas such as Lloret de Mar and Tossa de Mar have leisure facilities and many hotels. In the rock parts however, villages were untouched by the advent of tourism. These form a part of the attraction in the area. 
<br /><br />There are many coastal towns in the area. Most of these can be reached by mountain roads that are winding. One of such areas is Cadeques. Salvador Dali, the famous painter used to live here. The home of this great artist can still be visited to date. There are many areas that are interesting to visit in the region of Costa Brava. 
<br /><br />In Figueres, the theater museum Dali is a great place. It is 38 kilometers to the west of Cadeques. The building was actually designed by Dali himself. The artist’s works that include sculptures and paintings can still be found in the area. The Room of Mae West which is a scenefication can be seen here. 
<br /><br />Dali’s home after his wife Gala died was at the Castle Gala-Dali. It is situated in Pubol. The 11th century castle’s façade was untouched although the interiors were redesigned altogether. Dresses and personal belongings of gala can be seen here. There are also many of Dali’s artworks here. 
<br /><br />There are also archeological places in Costa Brava. This serves as evidence that the area had early inhabitants long before the Romans and Greeks arrived in the region. Ullastret was an Iberian settlement area. There are temples, granaries, wells and houses that date back to the 2nd and 6th century BC. Another ruin is the Piug de Castellet located near Lloret de Mar. A town wall and some houses can still be seen.
