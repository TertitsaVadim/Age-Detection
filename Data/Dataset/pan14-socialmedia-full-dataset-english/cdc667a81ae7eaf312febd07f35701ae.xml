<br /><br />so yes, last night, interesting to say the least.
<br /><br />first of all as we were in the car waiting for biggles he rang and in a slightly angery, yet appolagetic voice, he informed us that he was not allowed out of school.....
<br /><br />so the night started with me trying as hard as i could to get someone to buy us some drink. this involved going up to complete strangers and trusting them with our money. it was all good untill i accidently asked an off duty police officer if he would do our shopping for us. luckaly he didn't file a report and it was trusted to a group of freindly drunkards to buy it for us.
<br /><br />so it was up to the top of our multi story carpark where the police can't see us and we propose a toast to the end of mocks and to our missing biggles.
<br /><br />after we were satisfied we had had enough we wondered back into town now alot more excited about what the evening will hold...
<br /><br />for you see, its not always that i like getting drunk, somtimes it is a bit frieghting, but even things that would have happened anyway feel spontaineouse, and there is a leval unpredictability in the air...
<br /><br />so we got the cathedral and nearly turned tail and ran for there were the largest group of disordaly chavs you could ever wish to see. how ever apon closer inspection we could see our friends, family and aquantenses amoungst the rable. there was one little chav who thought it would be fun to try and set people alight via a deoderant can and lighter. luckaly no one was burnt to ashes, although not through lack of trying.
<br /><br />at some point in the night, after tomathy had run of and my bandito and i were sweet charming two young women, the police came and told us, we were a rable, and even had the cheek to say that i was &quot;adding to the youth coulture&quot;
<br /><br />so whilst bandito ran off to find tomathy, who was still missing after he went off with a girl of his own twenty minutes before hand, i escorted our new friends to a safer place where the police were less warey to venture.
<br /><br />it was about another half an hour untill i saw bandito and tomathy again, and the were looking worse for wear. tomathy had a black eye and bandito was sporting a cut chin. it was obviouse what had happened, yet they still rushed to explain. the chavs who had previousely been od gentlmanly like composure had been agrivated by the fact the police had moved them along and had taken there violence out on poor tomathy and bandito.
<br /><br />so any how, shortly after it was back to mine for more drinks and some cards, and then bed, although i do not think we volentaraly went to sleep.
<br /><br />after a few hours sleep, it was up for school, and teachers have no sypathy for hungover students...

<br /><br />so yes, it has been a good few days since our end of mocks celabrations yet the effects and events of that night live on. tomathy waking up with his black eye drew a little attention from his parents and he was frowned appon by a good few teachers.
<br /><br />how ever the biggest event that affected me, which i did not think it would was me telling ellenor i loved her, which in a drunken mood i probably convinced myself i did, although in all fairness, it was not meant seriousely.
<br /><br />how ever, seeing her on sunday and her texting me untill three last night proves she must have some kind of feelings for me. she also adimmted she &quot;addors&quot; me. i genaraly get that. me and bandito's gentleman act manges to secure us a part in most girls heart, even if it is not seriouse. so should i take this admiration with a pinch of salt? she has said there are other men and i don't like her in that way, so surely it should be ok...
<br /><br />and if anyone does read this and are interested i got Bs in my mocks for maths english and geography, i get the rest of the results tomorow!!!

<br /><br />however my lungs were sensitive, and the smoke from the bonfire is harsher than the smoke i inhale from ciggarettes and brought on huge fits of coffing which made as if my lungs were going to implode. the pain was so great that i went to rest by the river, out of the way. but ferrit and her boyfriend, wondering past the river to go have some time by themselves saw me, and took it as their responsability to tell everyone, which lead to a huge wave of questions and concern. this is negative attention, which i'm not to fond of.
<br /><br />on other matters, i managed to scare elenor away by telling her i was addicted snow, which she believed, thus we go back to our old relationship of being, just freinds.
<br /><br />and on school matters...
<br /><br />so yes, mocks finnished, coursework finnished. now all i have to do is choose my A levals...

<br /><br />it's all about my girlfriend though, i'm gona have a little moan and hope she doesn't read this
<br /><br />well, yesterday was pretty ok, it was half day at school which is ussually when we see each other, but when she came to see me she had all her friends and told me she was having a 'girlie' day. which i thought was bad but her friends was content with just sitting in gepps (my house at school). plus i didn't really mind, i see enough off her to let her have a day with her friends
<br /><br />but the good thing is, where as when she normally says two words to me when she's with her friends, she actually spent time with me and talked to me for nearly all of her time in gepps. how ever when she had to go home i forgot to walk her back
<br /><br />ooops, i'm sure she'll get over it
<br /><br />although whilst i was talking to her, i did get the impression that i was being slightly annoying, but even when she left she came and sat back down next to me. talk about mixed messages
<br /><br />and today when i was hanging out with james in my spare, he said that bekka said that after we break up she thinks i will go out with her best friend
<br /><br />SHE'S THINKING ABOUT BREAKING UP ALREADY!!!
<br /><br />oh, but i still love her

<br /><br />as imiture as it may sound, i went to a school on saterday night. usually this is gay and at my old school only about three people would have gone.
<br /><br />but cos this school is a boarding school, it is the highlight of the term!!! this one was odd, because for the first time i had a girlfriend and i was also sober.
<br /><br />hmmm, i can actually remember most of it. i danced a bit, but speant the most of the time down bekka's throat.
<br /><br />when it came to walking bekka back to house, she decided to suduce me in the at the edge of a frost covered cricket, next to her favourite tree bernard.
<br /><br />why she couldn't come back to an empty gepps i don't understand. it was FUCKING cold. it was so cold that when i tryed to give her a love bite, i actually ended up biting her properly. 
<br /><br />but meh
<br /><br />chose my a levals as well
<br /><br />maths geography art history and art
<br /><br />should be fun, i want to be a historic survayer, just for kicks really. 
<br /><br />i got caught bunking maths as well, fair to say my parents wern't to happy. but thats the problem with boarding school, you do somtimes accidently fall asleep and miss lessons...
<br /><br />i had core of drums today as well (it's a marching band in the army) i learnt to play the great escape, i fealt cool
<br /><br />much love &lt;3

<br /><br />i actually love her, i just hates the way she treats me.
<br /><br />she is the best part of my life for the last three months and i liked her ages before we started going out, long before she even loved me
<br /><br />but she always talks about me behind my back. there are countless jokes that have been made about me behind my back that have been made by her, and she never tells me anything. i highly doubt she trusts me
<br /><br />the worst thing is i don't know weather this is true or wether it's me being paranoid. but it makes me hurt inside and makes me feel so shit about everything. but i know if i break up with her i will have nothing worth waking up for
<br /><br />advice please, other than drinking and smoking my self into a hole
