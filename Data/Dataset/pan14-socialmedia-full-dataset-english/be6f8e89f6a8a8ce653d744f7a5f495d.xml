Why Shop Mphone  for Firefighters As the hearsays are gradually confirmed, American Magzine Industry has set out on the preparations.What's Must-Own now?: MP200 !
<br /><br />In the summer of 2009, Time Warner has found a design company called &quot;Wonderfactory&quot; in New York. Tips you Should Remember the Most Expensive Mphone of the Month This company is specializes in the Transformation from the traditional media to the digital reading platform. To early December of 2009, the Sports Ilustrated belonged to Time Warnerfirst produced a demonstration video of flat e-zine. Although the real look of iPad was unknown at the time, the video accurately predicted the physical appearance and interactive mode. The change of multi-finger touch and large-screen flat-panel leaped off the paper. For Internet users of &quot;iPad age&quot;, this experience is refreshing. This video named &quot;Sports Illustrated &quot;flat panel demo&quot; has been viewed 88 million times on YouTube, prototype of iPad version of &quot;Time&quot; magazine is also derived from this.
<br /><br />A month later, Apple had issued iPad. Here the [issue&quot; means that Jobs walked onto the stage to show the iPad to initiate the global discussion on this production. Third-party programmers start to proceed with various applications of the development, the real machine is still produced in Chinese factory, and beening introduced to the market officially after three months. At that day, the editorial team, the design department and the website operation department of the Times were summoned by the chief editor Richard Stengel for a meeting, the manufacture of iPad version was officially put on the agenda. Josh Quittner began to live the life [without iPad, but needing iPad&quot;.
<br /><br />In the first few days when the project was officially started, in order to simulate iPad's user experience, &quot;Time&quot; magazine design director asked DW Pine to make an iPad model with cardboard and glue. Put the printed simulated pictures in the middle of cardboard so as to feel the result of touch-scroll screen. These simulated pictures were still glued on the wall of Quittner`s office as yet. After the imitated pictures passed, they transformed the working point to the imitated software the Apple Company offered. Though different from the real object, you could seesaw the general effect of the products on computer screens. When just transferred on the simulator, Quittner found the iPad e-zine`s biggest puzzle – how to keep the rhythm sensation of paper magazine. On the iPad, the screen resolution is still not as good as paper, and the screen size are not up to &quot;Time&quot; magazine`s format, thus, one page of the magazine's contents need to be split into 2.5 screen to render. When moving the paper contents into the iPad version, a reader will have to make 25 times of shifting the screen to have an access to the body part.
<br /><br />As a result, the reading cadence of the Times on iPad has been rearranged: the articles are arranged in the order of short, medium, long, short, medium, long reports and then those profound reports requiring much time to read. Quattrone compares it into a sinusoidal wave, considering it proper to be read on digital facilities. There is a program of The Moment every term of the Times Magzine. It usually chooses one and additional explaining as the representation of news. On the ipad, the program has been developed into six whole-screen pictures and become the spread of &quot;pictrues per week&quot; of the Times Website. In the text, ratio of the picture in iPad version has also been greatly improved. In the same issue, there are only three pictures of Steve Jobs` reports, while in the iPad version, there are 11 pictures which can mostly represent Jobs` career, you can click to open the album to see the full Screen pictures.

Iâ€™ll Have What Fergie Having: iPhone Cases  How can Apple imagine that users can complete important tasks on computer without the mouse. However, some users commented that, &quot;iPad is a magical revolution. Could not imagine, after people experience a fantastic user interface of Apple, who will still use the keyboard and mouse?&quot; These comments are just from iPad. But we should know that these users have not really come into contact with iPad. Made a synthesis of iPad comments and found that they come from two groups: major fans of electronic products sbelittle iPad, while iPad is mainly popular among the public. For the two diffierent groups, they just can review iPad from their diffierent ways. Electronic products fans, to use BitTorrent or Linux operating system, or to own many electronic mail boxes which have a amount bigger than your pockets? If your answer is Yes, you are belong to this group.You Know What?! Aunt all Prefer N900 phone
<br /><br />Generally speaking, iPad is just like iPod Touch of a bigger size. iPad is about half-feet thick with glass as its upper part, and aluminum alloy, back cover. iPad has no presses, except the HOME under the screen and the power press in the top of the body. Wi-Fi version`s iPad can surf the internet only through Wi-Fi hotspots. Another version of the iPad may access the internet both through Wi-Fi hotspots and mobile operator AT &amp; T's mobile network. Just as the iPhone, users can complete the operation by knocking or dragging with fingers. When the 9.7 inches screen is closed, you can see every finger print on it clearly.
<br /><br />iPad has an e-book reader application, but it will not save the newspaper and book industries. As an e-book reader, iPad's ability in selective reading is not strong, and it is currently only able to read 60,000 books. Users can not clearly read under the light along. iPad weighs about 1.5 pounds, so it can last some time and you will feel iPad very heavy. In contrast with this product, the Amazon Kindle e-book reader weighs only 10 ounces. The books from the Apple bookstore cannot be read in other devices. Even using Apple's Mac or iPhone, can not read these books either. When the iPad is vertical, it is the bad experience to make text input on the keyboard in the screen. And when it is turned 90 degrees, the keyboard is unable to use basically.
<br /><br />Apple will launch a matching keyboard in April which is priced at 70 dollars. Once it is installed, iPad would be separated into two parts. There is a processer with faster speed of iPad. The running speed is faster than iPone. However, iPad can not play Flash video. It is not proper for Apple let iPad confront the famous video form on the net.
<br /><br />Although some video sites turn video to a compatible format to iPad/iPhone/Touch, such as YouTube, TED.com, CBS.com and others, but now all the news sites and game sites still using Flash. In another word, it needs aeveral years to let the iPad play all videos on websites.
<br /><br />Like the iPhone, iPad can not run multiple applications simultaneously. iPad does not have UBS interface and camera which means that users can not use Skype for video chat. Apple may add camera in the next version of iPad. The bottom line is that the user can buy a laptop with complete keyboard, DVD drive, USB interface, camera card slot and camera with less money. In addition, if the user has owned a laptop and a smart phone, will he buy the excess third device?

Before that, Apple`s developers could use whatever they need to develop the application. After the modification, Apple reduces the tools which developers can use to 3 kinds.3 New You Should Know
<br /><br />Some developers claimed that they will no longer develop applications for Apple products. Give a Glimpse of 5 Most Attractive TV80 , You Will Impressed!

However, according to critics, Apple takes this measure mainly aiming to beat its competitors for it is far too strict for simply improve the quality of applicationWomen in Lisbon all Are Crazy about to Wear iPhone plastic cases
<br /><br />Many developers use some special tools for physical modeling, or take them as 3D graphics engine. These tools can be used to develop certain type of application like game. Upon the new provision of Apple, all applications submitted to it should be applied with appointed tools; otherwise it will be rejected to enter App Store.Some Trend Bible that Deserve to Learn for Maintaining Your mini i9 phone
<br /><br />Many developers show their resentment in the blog on Apple. One developer named Hank Williams said: [Once those useful tools are separated from developers, things would be like that the developers are required to develop software for iPhone in a specified desk.&quot; Another developer Pierre • Lebo Ping said that the changed terms of Apple's is hardly feasible. He urged developers to express their dissatisfaction towards Apple.You Know What? I Bought a All New E66 2.4 for My Mother at a Very Low Price
<br /><br />Many developers joined the face book group of &quot;I and Adobe are together&quot;, the group now has 6,000 members. One named Dan-Gris programmer said he would not develop applications for the iPhone. Anther developer named Greg-Silaipake sent a letter to Apple CEO Steve Jobs, and he said the revised terms limited the creativity.
<br /><br />Jobs answered that this limitation is for the improvements of the quality of applications, because non-standard applications developed with the help of other tools would hinder the development of iPhone. Apple's official has yet not commented on such dissatisfaction to the outside. Industry experts point out, Apple's restrictions will prevent developers to reuse the application of Adobe Flash. Currently, both iPhone and iPad are not compatible with Flash. In April 12th, Adobe released a software suit named Creative Suit 5 which will help developers transfer flash codes into iPhone codes.
<br /><br />Flash programs are common on the Internet. Many games and video are using Flash for development. However, according to Apple`s new clause, applications developed with the help of Creative Suit 5 will be rejected by Apple.
<br /><br />Adobe said that Apple changing its licensing terms will not prevent the company released software in a statement. Kevin Lynch (CTO of Adobe) said in his blog that this function will still be included in CS5, while whether it will be adopted is up to apple.

The Latest Collections of iphone on sale  are Said to be the Hottest One According to the media reports, some Apple fans published an Apple an internal memo on March 22. Apple claims in the internal memo that it plans to allow American customers to buy the iPhone of Apple of full price under the premise that they do not sign service contracts with AT &amp; T.Most Dramatic 9700 phone In Vogue
<br /><br />But judging from the not &quot;unlocked&quot; state of iPhone, clients need to book some wireless services of AT&amp;T company after buying the full price Apple phone. How to Get Rid of the Scar of your iphone accessories cheap But the users buy Apple mobile phone at full price do not need to comply with the two-year use agreement prescribed in AT &amp; T / iPhone agreement, which provides convenience for the customers choosing compound wireless services. Attractive Mini i9 Modish
<br /><br />Apple company claimed in the memo to &quot;all stuff&quot; that clients can buy full price iPhone without accepting the contract with AT&amp;T company. The iPhone 3G with 8GB memory space price 499 US dollars, 16GB 599 dollars and 32GB 699 dollars. While in the current U.S. market, the iPhone 3G signed a two-year service contract with AT &amp; T sells for 99 dollars; the iPhone 3GS of 16 GB sells for 199 dollars; and the iPhone 3GS of 32GB sells for 299 dollars. The market analysts believe that the act of Apple sell iPhone handsets at full price will further reduce the profit margin of AT &amp; T's exclusive sales of the iPhone.
<br /><br />In the memo, Apple also mentions the two restrictive articles, each customer can only buy one iPhone at full price one day, and each customer can at most 10 phones at full price. There are two main reasons for iPhone mobile phone clients who can only choose wireless service from AT&amp;T company to drop this service contract at present. After selecting buying the iPhone of full price, you can choose to sign a short-term service contract with AT &amp; T. In the future, after Apple and other wireless service carriers sign a cooperation agreement, you can choose the wireless service operators.
<br /><br />The analyst Michael Gartenberg in Market analysis company Altimeter Group pointed out that this memo reveals a &quot;ironic&quot; message. The customers who buy the iPhone of full price still need to sign an agreement with the AT &amp; T Wireless Services Inc., which indicates that Apple's development of thinking has no substantive changes.
<br /><br />Last year, AT&amp;T only sold iPhone with two-year sevice contract that does not need to sign to old customers. At that time the 8GBiPhone handset's selling price was 599 US dollars; the 16GBiPhone handset's selling price is 699 US dollars. Experts guess that the act of Apple company may means that after the expiration of the contract of the mono sell iPhone of AT&amp;T, Apple company may choose to sign the selling deal with other wireless running companies.

The user of iPhone exceeded 500 thousands only in four months in South Korea. By virtue of iPhone, the number of wireless internet user increased strongly 10 times. Some unknown game or software developing companies became rich over night by providing [App Store&quot;(App Store, all kinds of business platforms) to Apple Corporation in South Korea. The new services like mobile banking and mobile office are introduced by using smart phone. IPhone is undoubtedly a catalyst for invigorating the Korean fictitious software industry.Choose Most Popular ciphone i9 for Housewives
<br /><br />In addition, as in the Korea whose society is full of power and motivation, the phone is undoubtedly the core element for measuring the competitiveness of individuals and of enterprises. The Best Blackberry Accessories for Work The news about the reappointment of Lee Kun-Hee, chairman of Samsung Electronics, is spread to the outside world by short message in Twitter.
<br /><br />But with calmly thinking, the translation brought by iPhone is not so happy. iPhone struck mobile phone industry heavily, it is one of five most important export trade. According to the latest trend of mobile phone importing and exporting from the knowledge and economy department of Korea, since last year till to March in this year, the exporting of Korea mobile phone is keeping decreasing. Since a large number of South Korean mobile phones are exported from 1997, except the global financial crisis last year, the factors, the export appears to the first time reduction which is more than 10%.
<br /><br />And the especial reason is that the price of iPhone is 199 to 299 dollars which is threatening the high level mobile phone, the most competitive part in Korea market. Adding companies of overseas mobile communication service which play a decisive role of mobile phones sales, it is willing to add wireless communication usage that is charging more fees for iPhone grants to make South Korea phones industries face a more difficult situation.
<br /><br />Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics did not predict that the mobile phone market would change around the software and the content. But for Sony of Japan who had predicated the change of the market, just got the much stronger shock from iPhone. Sony has earlier got into the content industry since it produced the global hot sold walkman in the 1980s. At that time, Sony invested thousand billion won to purchase audio-visual companies and movie studios, and made great efforts to develop the game industry.
<br /><br />However, after Apple's introduction of &quot;iTunes&quot; (an online store) in 2001 which is a strange and special business model involving the contents of transactions, Sony's 10-year efforts have been wasted. Sony`s one most competitive manufacturing production TV was also caught up by South Korea's. For Sony, it lost its most precious property for pursuing mirage. Executive of Sony recently told to journalist, [people standing for the technology of Sony are leaving it.&quot;
<br /><br />Last month, Ralph, CEO of the mobile department of AT&amp;T, confidently presented in the speech of the opening ceremony of the CTIA, [America will lead the wireless Internet and the smart mobile phone market in the whole world.&quot; That is to say, as the U.S. suppressed the Japanese manufacturing industry by its financial industry, the United States will use the Smartphone to control the world mobile phone market.

Choose Most Popular eken m003  for Housewives tech blog Gizmodo said Apple had two opportunities to get iPhone back in time to avoid worsening situation before they made public photos and video of new iPhone. This is a very obvious problem. Why did not Apple get back this mobile phone in time? In fact, they had two opportunities. But they missed them both.
<br /><br />This is what might have happened: An engineer of Apple went to a pub with a new confidential iPhone in 18th Mar. The day was his birthday. After a while, he left the pub, and also left his mobilephone on the pub's barstool.
<br /><br />The next thing was very funny: A drunk regular guest of that bar picked up this phone, he thought it was lost by somebody in a party of the bar, so he left it to partygoers. One of them was stumbledly aware that this phone was a bit strange. Based on our understanding of Apple's standard security protocol, this phone was almost immediately blocked by Apple. If someone worried that Apple just found the cell phone lost, do not make a mistake, they immediately knew the incident after the engineer last the phone.
<br /><br />At first, the person who got it wanted to give it back. What was going on then on the earth? What happened at that time? He recognized this was an iPhone phone, because its look and usage pattern were very like the iPhone, and even disguised as iPhone 3GS. Though there was no password protection, but it was running in a systema similar to that of the general iPhone OS, only slightly different, and the Facebook above and other applications were still running. The news comer expresses he hadn`t use this phone much. After some hours, that is, the following morning, the phone was out of use.
<br /><br />We believe that that was because the engineer or Apple had realized the mobile phone was lost. Perhaps at that day's night, they not only locked the new hardware's functions, but also hoped that the new operating system's information wouldn't be leaked. Therefore, the most sensible approach is calling Apple, rather than holding an inactive phone in hand. This insider began to contact Apple at the phone. Unfortunately, there was no result.
<br /><br />We assume that this phone was running the beta version of iPhone OS 4 operating system. We have previously tested such software. And we think that this software will be introduced for new generation of iPhone. But at that time, we did not notice that [Find My iPhone&quot; service of MobileMe are not available for iPhone OS 4.0. In previous versions, with this feature through the network map the location of iPhone can be deternined only a few seconds. In other words, it may be due to the failure of beta software that makes Apple can not track the phone.
<br /><br />This function of MobileMealso can not be used in the iPhone OS 4, but the iPhone's Exchange Server is able to provide the same function. This means Apple can stop iPhone in distance. The final fact proved Apple did so. Of course, Apple may also develop a completely different tracking service or launch a new iPhone OS 4 version, making Find My iPhone can work normally.
