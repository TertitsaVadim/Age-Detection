Howard knows of multiple people who have won big jackpots more than once, including one person who won a jackpot twice in one month.<br /><br />Unlike some of the pick-five or pick-six numbers games that Howard studies, Ginther won three of her four big prizes with scratch-off tickets.<br /><br />&quot;As far as I know, there's no way to beat the odds with scratch-offs,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Ginther appears to have figured out a way to beat the system, or she's just really lucky.

Lustig won his first lottery prize of $10,000 in 1992. He has won six other times since.<br /><br />According to ABC News, Lustig’s biggest win was for $842,000 in 2002.

Her next win came in 2006 in the &quot;Holiday Millionaire&quot; scratch-off, which netted her $2 million. Her odds of winning those games were 1 in 15.8 million and 1 in 1,028,338.<br /><br />Four-Time Lottery Winner<br /><br />In 2008, Ginther purchased a winning &quot;Millions and Millions&quot; scratch-off ticket. She collected $3 million from the game, which she had a 1 in 909,000 chance of winning.<br />Ginther chose to receive her first prize annually over 19 years, but the following three prizes were all paid out in as lump sums. Her latest prize will amount to $7.5 million after taxes.<br /><br />Texas Lottery Director of Media Relations Bobby Heith said winning multiple times is rare, but not unheard of.<br /><br />&quot;Ten million dollars is, I think, the largest prize we've ever given in a scratch-off ticket,&quot; Heith said.<br /><br />Gail Howard, a lottery expert who writes books on how to maximize winning probability, said that while Ginther's luck is special, it is far from the first time someone has won big more than once. Howard knows of multiple people who have won big jackpots more than once, including one person who won a jackpot twice in one month.<br /><br />Unlike some of the pick-five or pick-six numbers games that Howard studies, Ginther won three of her four big prizes with scratch-off tickets.<br /><br />&quot;As far as I know, there's no way to beat the odds with scratch-offs,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Ginther appears to have figured out a way to beat the system, or she's just really lucky.
