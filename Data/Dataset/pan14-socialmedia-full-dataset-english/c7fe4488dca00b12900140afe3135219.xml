Unfortunately, most people joining a network marketing program for the first time don't read the books first. Even if they did, they would get a message that is really hard to grasp for someone used to the standard sales techniques of the modern world.<br /><br />If you are new to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Ftd2F5dG9vbHMud29yZHByZXNzLmNvbS8yMDExLzA0LzAyL3Rvb2xzLW9mLXRoZS10cmFkZS8_" target="_blank">Team INA Tools</a> network marketing, a great book to read is &quot;Masters Of Networking&quot; by Ivan R. Misner, Ph.D., and Don Morgan, M.A. While it does contain instructions on how and where to network, I believe that part of its value lies in what it doesn't always say out loud, but hints at in the subtitle: Building Relationships For Your Pocketbook And Soul.<br /><br />So what does that have to do with selecting the product that you will attempt to &quot;sell&quot; through network marketing?<br /><br />The book I just mentioned gets a lot of its message across through the stories of people who have passed through the stages of learning to network. In keeping with that, I am going to talk about my favorite subject...myself.<br /><br />In 1996 I was introduced to my first network marketing venture. Never mind what it was, but I will say that it was a valuable product and I felt good being associated with it. I honestly felt that it was a service that many people could use and that by purchasing this service they could get better service in certain health related areas and they could possibly save large sums of money.<br /><br />In other words, I BELIEVED!<br /><br />I also believed that I could make a lot of money. After all, I saw other people doing it, and being a product of 20th century marketing practices, I began doing what I thought I was supposed to be doing. I placed ads, I handed out flyers, left business cards laying around, and mailed out a lot of brochures. After a few months, I was making some money, but it sure seemed a hard way to make a living!<br /><br />In the meantime, people I knew were making larger and larger sums from the same product, and with a fraction of the time, effort, and money. So I did the next logical thing...I dropped out and spent a couple of years licking my wounds, nursing a grudge, and generally being a chump. The one thing I didn't do was ask for help or study the subject of network marketing. However, I DID keep signing up for program after program, with the same predictable results.<br /><br />Finally, I broke down and did the unthinkable...I did some research!<br /><br />What did I learn? I learned that some of the best &quot;sales&quot; people and some of the best network marketers had the same thing to say. Their opinion was to quit concentrating on sales and concentrate on building a network of people who respected you. They did not necessarily mean &quot;respected&quot; in the sense of someone who was an expert or who stood head and shoulders above the rest. What they meant was that you should be someone who is willing to listen, to help, to guide, to support...to be a genuine friend and someone who could be counted on.<br /><br />I started thinking about the people I had known who were successful. Not a one was a &quot;sales&quot; person. They were housewives, retirees, ex-teachers, bus drivers, fast food workers, garbage collectors...but most had three things in common. They believed in the product and the company, they knew the important points of the product and the opportunity, and they were genuinely interested in and involved with those they sold to or recruited.<br /><br />As it happened, at about the time I was doing this research, I actually had a JOB teaching newcomers to an industry how to become successful in that field. It felt great. I got to take people and help bring them to a point where they were going to be in a position to have a new career and make lots of money. I didn't have to &quot;sell&quot; them anything. I provided solid information, guidance, advice based on experience, and sometimes a shoulder to cry on. I noticed one interesting thing. They hung on my every word. If I said a certain item was important to have, within 48 hours at least half of my students would have that item if they didn't have it already.<br /><br />By the way, one common benefit of the job I am speaking of and a network marketer is the gratitude of the people that have come into the business and been successful thanks at least in part to the interest and support you have shown them.<br /><br />I saw this happen again and again, and not just with me, but with others who were providing this instruction as well.<br /><br />Okay, I'm slow, but not fatally so. I realized that if I could place myself in a similar position in a network marketing endeavor, I might have similar results.<br /><br />I then began to apply my newfound knowledge to network marketing, and, after a couple of false starts and the occasional retraining session, I found out that the technique works!<br /><br />Start with a good strong product from a reliable company. Make sure you understand what the heck you are talking about, arm yourself with order pads and pencils, and then get out there and start being NICE! I know it's going to be difficult, but you will have to buckle down and be a benefit to society and let people like you.<br /><br />I guess you've figured out that in the network marketing world, YOU are the best product to sell.

By all accounts, our marriage is one of, if not, the most important relationship we'll ever have. We go into marriage believing that our bond with our spouse is unique and unbreakable. When that dynamic starts to shift and we see some cracks in the foundation of the relationship everything we believed can be questioned. If you love your spouse and you don't want to even consider the idea of divorce you need to address the problem issues now. With proper guidance, patience and insight you can not only improve your marriage but you can rebuild it so you and your partner are closer than you've ever been before.<br /><br />One common thread that runs through marriages that are facing difficulties is that one of the partners has simply started taking the other for granted. This is easy to do and once it happens it can undermine the entire relationship. The person who feels used starts to resent their spouse and this leads to arguments and unending frustration. If you are the person who feels taken for granted you need to shift that dynamic right now. The easiest and most effective way to do that is to become less available to your partner. You may think that's impossible given the fact that you two live together and spend an incredible amount of time with each other, but you can make it happen. Just as you likely pulled back from your partner when you needed some reassurance of their feelings before marriage, you should do the same now. Go out and spend time pursuing your own interests or focus more on your career. Sometimes you must show your spouse what they risk losing if you want them to fully appreciate you.<br /><br />Another issue that many couples face once they have children is the shift in their relationship from that of romantic partners to co-parents. Having a child together dramatically impacts the dynamic between a man and a woman. Suddenly they are thrust into a new world where another individual is completely dependent on them. This often causes a couple to lose their connection to each other. They are so busy tending to the needs of their family that they lose sight of each other's needs. You have to ensure this doesn't happen in your marriage. If it's already happened, you need to change it. One easy way to do this is to plan alone time each and every week for you and your spouse. Make an effort to set aside time only for each other. That means you need to arrange child care or you need to stay up later or get up earlier so you can interact without the children present. Talk about things, hold hands, make love or do whatever you can to keep your romantic connection alive. This is vitally important to the health and well being of your marriage.

In spite of this, though, Montenegro offers a rich history and an interesting culture. It has many beautiful attractions, as well, which include four spectacular Montenegro national parks and  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3JlbnQtYS1jYXItcmlqZWthLmNvbS9vcGF0aWphLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">rent a car opatija</a>.<br /><br />The Durmitor National Park is the largest of all the Montenegro national parks, covering an area of roughly 39,000 hectares.<br /><br />Established in 1952, the park is the site of 18 glacial lakes, the biggest of which is the Crno Lake or Black Lake, as well as blue rivers, deep canyon valleys and impressive mountains. There are various necropolises, medieval monuments and old churches within the park, too.<br /><br />Because of this, the Durmitor National Park has been included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites - one of only two in Montenegro. It is the most popular national park in the country, as well, providing tourists with opportunities to go horseback riding, rafting, kayaking and hiking.<br /><br />The Skadar Lake National Park has a large area, too. In fact, the Skadar Lake (also known as Lake Scutari) can reach up to 530 square kilometres at times, depending on its water level, making it the biggest lake in the Balkan peninsula. Of all the Montenegro national parks, the Skadar Lake National Park is the one most known a birdwatcher's paradise since it is home to many swamp birds, including the rare Dalmatian pelican, which is also the symbol of the park.<br /><br />Aside from birdwatching, the park is also a great place for windsurfing and spelunking. It can provide a great gastronomic experience, too, since the towns of Virpazar and Rijeka Crnojevica, which are famous for their restaurants, and the vineyard of Crmnica can be found on the lakeshore.<br /><br />You can enjoy an unforgettable dining experience within the Lovcen National Park, too, particularly in Njegusi Village, which manufactures the best ham and cheese in the country. What sets this park apart from other Montenegro national parks, though, is the fact that it is the site of the Njegos Mausoleum, one of the most important cultural monuments in Montenegro and the masterpiece of Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic.<br /><br />Finally, there is the Biogradska Gora National Park. Although the smallest, it is by no means the least of the Montenegro national parks. In fact, it is just as popular because of the developed tourist facilities around Biogradska Lake. It also contains a 1,600-hectare rainforest - one of only three remaining rainforests in all of Europe.<br /><br />Indeed, these Montenegro national parks are the gems of Montenegro, and are certainly great places for holidays. So whether you want to have an exciting adventure or just get away from all the hustle and bustle of work and city life, don't forget to consider Montenegro as one of the destinations for your next vacation.

However, they must be used properly and safely <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jlc3RzaG9ja2NvbGxhcnNmb3Jkb2dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">shock collar reviews</a> if you're going to train your dog with them. In this article, I will show you how to use shock collars to achieve this goal.<br /><br />A <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jlc3RzaG9ja2NvbGxhcnNmb3Jkb2dzLmNvbS8_" target="_blank">shock collars for dogs</a> is an electronic dog collar that will send a shock to the dog when they do something wrong. Most of these types of collars come with different levels of shocks that can be administered, and should be set properly for the size of the dog. A shock will be sent from the transmitter to the receiver of the dog's collar. You control the transmitter to send signals when your dog does something that you do not approve.<br /><br />It's a simple idea -- any time the dog does something wrong, you send a shock to the dog. They might not figure it out the first time, but if they do the same thing again and get shocked, they might start to notice a pattern. If they do it three or four more times and receive a shock every time they have done that same behavior, then soon they will think that doing that behavior causes them to get shocked. Thus, they will stop doing that behavior.<br /><br />An electronic shock collar can be used to stop many different kinds of misbehaviors in dogs, such as jumping up on furniture or visitors, digging holes in the backyard, chewing on things and so on.<br /><br />It is important that you have your transmitter on you at all times so you can administer shocks immediately if the dog misbehaves. It is important that you start the shock at the lowest setting possible so you do not send too much electricity to the collar. If your dog is not responsive to the low shock then increase the settings on the collar.<br /><br />If the dog starts to panic or becomes excessively loud after being shocked, then the chances are you have the shock level up to much. In this case, make sure to decrease it. You want to discipline your pet, not cause it to go into a panic.<br /><br />It is important that the dog training shock collar be used to modify misbehavior and not aggressive behavior. Biting and attacking others is something that you will not correct with a simple electronic collar. In this case, a professional trainer may be needed.

One way that I've found to do this in a business setting is with custom business cards. Custom business cards can range from the subtle to the exotic and everything in between. Here are just a few ways that you can make a striking impression with your very own custom business cards: <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jYXJkc21hZGVlYXN5LmNvbS8_" target="_blank">business card printing</a>,<br /><br />o    Shapes - any shape you can imagine is possible. Do you own a pizzeria? Consider pizza shaped business cards. You have a pet-based business? Make your business cards in the shape of dogs and cats. Keep in mind that custom shapes are often costly, but the impression can be well worth the expense.<br /><br />o    Sizes - custom business cards can be made to be any size. 2 x 3 is the standard business card size, but experiment with 3 x 3 or 2 x 2. Anything to set your card apart from the competition. Changing the size of your cards can be an inexpensive way to set your card apart.<br /><br />o    Colors - do not underestimate the power of full color custom business cards. While black print on a white card is standard, think about adding at least a color logo or even a full color picture in the background. The more color, the more expensive, so pick a format that suits your needs.<br /><br />o    Texture - custom business cards can be made of anything from metal to rice paper to plastic. Using a unique texture is a subtle way of setting your business card apart. An inexpensive way to add texture to your cards is to use different types of card stock. But if you need to make a dramatic impression, the expensive metal cards are sure to stand out.<br /><br />o    Opacity - one of the more stunning effects I've seen lately with custom business cards is the new see-through card. These cards are made of plastic ranging from the thickness of a credit card to thinner than paper. They come in varying degrees of opacity. Some of these cards are as clear as glass, making the logo and information on the card appear is if it is standing in midair. Other cards just look a little bit foggy, but are still see-through. While somewhat expensive, this can be a great way to stand out from the crowd.

The coffee market is a $70 billion a year industry, thus proving there's money to be made. With this in mind, is Boresha Coffee going to be the next big thing in network marketing, or will it be just another MLM opportunity?<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Product&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Boresha Coffee offers an arabica coffee blend to market. The company claims their blend is better than many of the leading brands you're used to consuming. This is a sizable claim considering the number of choices that are available when it comes to a cup of joe, but the product may quickly appeal to someone looking for a new brand to start their day.<br /><br />One big focus of Boresha Coffee is to donate a large part of their profits to children's charities. This is certainly a major step forward in the industry and an initiative that could lead to tremendous growth for Boresha.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;The Review&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Boresha is establishing themselves with a good product, as all evidence shows the popularity of coffee. It's going to come down to how well they position themselves in the marketplace that will determine their success. They, like all network marketing opportunities, are faced with the battle of standing out from the crowd. If you decide to become a distributor, what will you do to set yourself apart from all the other Boresha Coffee representatives?<br /><br />In order to make their mark on the industry, Boresha will need to find a way to separate themselves from their competition. In order to do this, it is imperative for this MLM company to supply sufficient marketing strategies for their distributors and help them gain a substantial share of the market.<br /><br />The purpose of this review is to point out crucial factors to success in the network marketing industry. There's a certain mindset and education level that must be obtained in order to grow your business successfully. This applies not only to Boresha, but any network marketing opportunity you see.<br /><br />To ensure long-term success, Boresha must recruit some industry leaders that carry strong influence in the industry. This will help with the development of brand new distributors and make strides towards seeing all Boresha distributors share in the company's success.<br /><br />Top network marketers have experience implementing several online marketing strategies, including autoresponders, pay-per-click advertising, social networking, and many more. More importantly, industry professionals are proven leaders and are able to coach their teams to positive outcomes. Boresha's growth will lay in the ability of each individual's ability to master these skills and teach them to newcomers who join the opportunity.<br /><br />Finally, one of the biggest elements to Boresha Coffee's staying power is consistency. Network marketing companies have a tendency of changing their compensation plans, which can frustrate members and lead them to quitting the company altogether. Effective communication between top-tier leaders and distributors, as well as the development of new leaders, couuld prove to be the winning formula Boresha needs to stand out in the industry.<br /><br />If Boresha Coffee establishes consistency and recruits influential leaders into their fold, they have a chance to accomplish great things in the network marketing industry. The outlook for their future looks promising at this point, but their ability to develop new distributors and teach them how to effectively market their business will tell the true story.

While small business <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pZmduZXR3b3JrLmNvbQ__" target="_blank">factoring</a> companies do take a percentage of money acquired, in most cases it is well worth the small loss in order to get the outstanding dues paid.<br /><br />Large companies and firms that send out thousands of invoices for small amounts of money will likely find factoring economical. This is because factoring companies base their bids on the credit report of the indebted customer rather than your small business. Factoring companies charge for every invoice or account they have to investigate for credit rating information.<br /><br />For instance, if you have two hundred customers with outstanding accounts receivable of $50 or less, the cost for a factoring company to investigate each and every account will cost more money than you will be saving by outsourcing this kind of work. Small businesses with large outstanding accounts receivable transactions, on the other hand, will find a business factoring loan well worth the small profit loss.<br /><br />To decide if getting a factoring loan is the right choice for your business, grab a piece of paper and note down the expenses and profits of each option.<br /><br />To start, figure out how much interest on a regular loan would eventually add up to. Take into account how likely you will be to pay the maximum each and every month. It's safest to extend your estimates as far as how quickly you'll be able to pay the loan back.<br /><br />Next, do a little research online to find a factoring company that meets your specifications. The specifics of their factoring services should be listed prominently on their website, but don't be shy about giving them a call or sending an email if you have questions. Once you have all this information, you'll be able to make a realistic estimate about how much of your accounts' outstanding balance you would lose by choosing a factoring company.<br /><br />Now, compare the cost of you doing your own collections work against the cost of working with a factoring company. In most cases, small business factoring saves money and extra stress in the long run. However, every business, business model and financial situation is unique and should be given individual attention.<br /><br />By analyzing and balancing the data gathered, you will be able to see what choice is best for you and your small business. If you need money in hand right away, a small business factoring loan is a reliable and effective way to get just that. You may lose some money up front, but if you invest your sudden influx of cash correctly, it'll make you a bundle down the road.

If you guessed that they turn into a whining, groveling, sniffling mess... you'd be right! Look, if you are guilty of having gotten to the point where the only solution to win back your girlfriend seems to be to get down on your knees and beg for her absolute forgiveness, pay attention. You might be doing more harm than good by trying to compel her to come back to you this way.<br /><br />Have you ever seen in a movie where the guy does exactly this? Meaning, you get to see him get down on his knees, with tears in his eyes? Doesn't it look a little, oh I don't know, uncomfortable to see that? Don't you think your ex girlfriend is going to feel the same way if this is how you go about trying to win her back?<br /><br /><strong>Guess what? </strong><br /><br />It IS how she is going to feel. I can remember the first time I really got the chance to get inside the mind of a woman about this issue. I was sitting with some female friends of mine, just having some lunch and conversation and the topic of ex boyfriends came up. One of the women brought up a little story about how one of her ex boyfriends did the whole, I'm a beg you until you come back to me deal.<br /><br />I could not believe the reaction. There were five women there, plus me and another buddy of mine. And all five women gave pretty much the same reaction with the same look on their face when they heard that story.<br /><br />Disgust. Horror. The look a woman gives when she sees a pathetic man. These were the looks that were on all of their faces. Oh yeah. Mix in a little bit of laughter and you get the picture. So, me being curious about this, I did my own impromptu poll about this.<br /><br />Every single woman had pretty much the same answer. Sure, they all used different words, but the overall meaning was the same. None of them would ever get back with an ex boyfriend that turned into a sniffling mess. Even though they might feel sorry for them.<br /><br /><strong>Why does this matter to YOU?</strong><br /><br />Because there is a MUCH BETTER way to go about it, trust me.<br /><br /><strong>Here's a little advice on how to get her back without turning into a sniffling mess:</strong><br /><br /><strong>1. Have a little self pride, even if you want to get her back.</strong><br /><br />You need her respect if you are going to get back together. This is not something that you can skirt around. (Like the pun there<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/unsure.gif" alt=":)" />. You have to be able to approach her with a sense of pride, albeit not too much if you want her to take you seriously.<br /><br /><strong>2. Be sorry about what may have happened, but do not grovel.</strong><br /><br />There is a BIG difference between being sorry for whatever may have gone down that led to the break up and groveling. Sorry is when you let her know that you did wrong and that's it. Groveling is when you take it to that level of constantly apologizing to her. Don't grovel.<br /><br /><strong>3. Prove to her that you are the guy she should be with, but not with words.</strong><br /><br />Words are so cheap and any woman knows this. They learn it when they are teenagers or maybe in college. They all have that ex boyfriend from their past that they trusted and believed and then got hurt. So, if you really want to win back your ex girlfriend, you need to put less emphasis on the talk, and more emphasis on the way that you ACT around her.

The anesthesiologist or CRNA will start placing monitors on you, and the circulating nurse might be placing SCD's on your legs or feet. After all monitors are placed, the anesthesiologist or CRNA will start having you breath oxygen through an oxygen mask. Soon after, you will start getting medication through your IV to make you unconscious. You will be receiving general anesthesia for this procedure which means you will have a breathing tube placed. Once the medication has taken effect and you are unconscious, the anesthesiologist or CRNA will insert the breathing tube. After the breathing tube is in place, you will be positioned and prepped for surgery. If you are a male, your abdomen will probably be shaved. You may have a catheter placed in your bladder to drain urine. The circulating nurse will then &quot;prep&quot; your abdomen with a betadine or chlorhexidine gluconate antiseptic antimicrobial skin cleanser, <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL1JOWVRhbGsuY29t" target="_blank">gastrick bypass surgery</a>.<br /><br />Once your abdomen is prepped with the skin cleanser, the surgical team will begin to place sterile drapes over you. You will be covered completely with these sterile drapes except for the area in which they will be making the incisions. After all the drapes are on, and all the equipment the surgeon will be using is hooked up and ready to go, the lap band procedure will begin.<br /><br />The surgeon will begin by making several small incisions in your abdomen. These incisions will be used to put the laparoscope and laparoscopic tools through. Carbon dioxide gas is then pumped in to inflate your abdomen; this is done to make it much easier for the surgeon to see. The surgeon will use the laparoscope to see inside your abdomen without having to make a large incision and open your belly. The surgeon will be looking at a monitor which the video from the laparoscope will be sent to throughout the lap band procedure.<br /><br />A special adjustable round band will be inserted through one of the small incision sites, and carefully placed around the top part of your stomach using the laparoscopic tools. Once the band has been placed in the correct position, it will be fastened in place. An access port which is connected to the band with special tubing is then placed in the abdominal wall. This access port is placed to where it can be later used to adjust the band. By using a special needle and syringe to add or remove saline, the band will become tighter or looser. After the band and port are secured, the incisions are closed with either staples or suture.<br /><br />When the lap band procedure is over the anesthesiologist or CRNA will begin to wake you up. You may hear them asking you to open your mouth or to squeeze their hand. They do this to make sure you are awake enough to breath on your own before they take the breathing tube out. They will then remove the breathing tube. You will be moved onto a stretcher and they will wheel you to the recovery room or PACU (post anesthesia care unit).
