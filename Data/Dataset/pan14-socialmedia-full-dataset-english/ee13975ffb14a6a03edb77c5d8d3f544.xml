<br />A watch is a small clock, typically worn either on the wrist or attached on a chain and carried in a pocket; wristwatches, however, are the most common type of watch used today. Watches evolved in the 17th century from spring powered clocks, which appeared in the 15th century. The first watches were strictly mechanical. As technology progressed, the mechanisms used to measure time have, in some cases, been replaced by use of quartz vibrations or electromagnetic signals. Digital watch was developed in 1970.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Basic Structure of Watch:&lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Movement:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
<br />A movement in the watch is the measure of passage of time and shows the current time (displaying other information like date, month and day). Motions may be entirely mechanical, entirely digital (with no moving parts), or a mix of the two. Most watches intended mainly for time keeping today have digital movements, with analog hands on the watch face showing time.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Antireflection:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A treatment to the watch glass which assures the dispersion of reflected light.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Numbers system:&lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Automatic winding:&lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt; The watch is wound by the motion of the wearer's arm rather than through turning the winding stem.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Bangle bracelet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br /><br />A band formed by two or more long-curved links which wrap around the wrist. Bangles may have an opening between the links to slide onto the wrist, with or without clasps.
<br /> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Band: &lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />A band may be more specifically described as either a &quot;strap&quot;.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Battery :&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />A Power storage cell used to supply power for various movements and displays in watches.

<br />Swiss watchmaker Vacheron  Constantin marked its 250th anniversary in 2005 with the world's most complicated wrist watchâ€”the Tour de l'Ile. The watch is so complicated that it required over 10,000 hours of research to create. Its name refers to one of the historical sites of the venerable company, located next to the current Maison Vacheron Constantin on the Quai de l'Ile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

<br />The most common type of moving violation is speeding. Because a New York motorist can get 3 to 11 points for committing such an infraction, it is important to know how to fight such a ticket. This information is particularly useful at the Traffic Violations Bureau because this venue does not allow for any type of deal-making of plea bargaining. This article will provide a basic framework to help you fight a New York speeding ticket at the Traffic Violations Bureau.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The first step is to compute how many points are involved with the New York State speeding ticket you have been given.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The following chart will help you figure this out:&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;li&gt;1 - 10 mph over speed limit - 3 points&lt;/li&gt;
<br />&lt;li&gt;11 - 20 mph over speed limit - 4 points&lt;/li&gt;
<br />&lt;li&gt;21 - 30 mph over speed limit - 6 points&lt;/li&gt;
<br />&lt;li&gt;31 - 40 mph over speed limit (possible suspension) - 8 points&lt;/li&gt;
<br />&lt;li&gt;More than 40 mph over speed limit (possible suspension) - 11 points&lt;/li&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Points are measured from the date of offense (even if you are convicted years later). So when adding the possible points for a newly issued speeding ticket you must go back 18 months from the date of the new ticket and determine how many other points you have on your record. Also, three speeding convictions within 18 months will result in an automatic revocation in your driving privileges for 6 months.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The next step is to determine whether your case is returnable at a Traffic Violations Bureau (TV<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> court or not. There are two, very different traffic court systems in New York State and, therefore, this determination is important for you to understand what you can and cannot do. If you are not within the TVB, then usually you can resolve the case by a plea deal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The TVB courts cover any New York traffic ticket issued in New York City (Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island), western Suffolk, Buffalo and Rochester. A New York speeding ticket issued in any other place within New York State will not be a TVB court.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The reason this is an important inquiry is that TVB courts generally do not allow any type of deal-making or plea bargaining. Rather, you must either plead guilty or not guilty and, if you plead not guilty, you are given a hearing where you will either win or lose. In this &quot;all or nothing&quot; court, it really pays to retain an New York traffic lawyer to fight your case. That is, a New York traffic attorney who is experienced and knowledgeable in fighting speeding tickets at the TVB. Putting aside the emotions involved with fighting your own case, most motorists do not know how to listen carefully or cross examine. Rather, they basically ignore the officer's testimony, fail to ask any questions and, instead, just tell the judge their story. This incomplete approach is not recommended and is clearly not effective.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If you do fight your own TVB speeding ticket, listen carefully to the officer's testimony and even take notes. If the officer omits critical testimony (ex., date, time, location, direction, your ID information), then point this out to the judge after the officer rests. Similarly, if the officer gives testimony which is inconsistent with his other testimony or the information on the ticket, then likewise point this out to the judge.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />For instance, I once was fighting a NYC speeding ticket when the officer testified that the motorist was proceeding east bound on the Long Island Expressway. The ticket, however, indicated W/B (i.e., west bound). After the officer rested, I showed the ticket to the judge who promptly dismissed the case.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Even without an omission or inconsistency, you should still ask thoughtful questions of the officer. For example, if your defense is that the officer pulled over the wrong car, then ask him where was he when he first saw your car, did he have to pass any other cars to apprehend your car, and how long did it take him or apprehend you. These types of questions build on your defense.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Also, ask to the see the officer's notes. Read them and determine whether his notes are consistent with his testimony. Any discrepancy should be pointed out to the judge. Also, do not be afraid to ask the officer to decipher illegible portions of his notes.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />After your cross examination of the officer, it is time for you to offer your defense. Speak slowly and clearly. Hand up any evidence supporting your defense such as photos, witness statements or diagrams. Keep in mind that the judge hears many, many such cases and, therefore, you should not be repetitive or rambling about irrelevant information.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;One last tip:&lt;/b&gt;  Prior to fighting your case, watch the judge and how he handles other cases. Does he listen and take notes? Does he seem impatient or distracted? If you are concerned about whether you will get a fair hearing, ask for a new date. It is unlikely that you will get the same TVB judge on the next assigned date.

<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If you think that certain traffic violations should be waved aside or ignored then you are having a wrong presumption. The reason is that if you were booked or issued a violation ticket, points will definitely be deducted from your license. When this happens, your chances of getting cheap insurance become minimal and you might end up having your driving license revoked.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />It is true that some traffic violations are worse than others but you should accord each the required attention it deserves so you don't become a traffic offender and face the consequences. Therefore, hiring the services of traffic violation lawyers is a viable option for you to choose.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />You really need these attorneys to stand in for you in both minor (misdemeanor) and major (felony) traffic violation. Do not ignore the powers and influence of traffic violation lawyers because they can help you out of any traffic offense you get yourself into. Here are summaries of how these lawyers would be of assistance to you if you hire their services.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Understanding NYS Speeding &amp; Traffic Tickets, Points, and Time Frames&lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />1. The weather in May, June, and July are a sharp respite from our brutally cold and sometimes icy winters, although this year we were lucky, with minimal snow, and only a short number of gloom days. The northeastern seaboard got bombed while we got hardly anything.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />2. The town and city of Ithaca go into summer mode, more tourists, festivals, and out of state visitors but much less College traffic and congestion. The population variance is immediately palpable.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />This blog post is for those that call me asking, how long will this (tickets, points, violations) stay on my record?
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />First, which record? Are we talking about your criminal record or your NYS DMV record?
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Second, the better set of questions, the ones they really want to ask but can't really articulate are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />How will this ticket (violation) impact me, my life, my insurance, my license, and in what way (s)?
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;THE IMPACT of UTT (Uniform Traffic Tickets) and Points&lt;/b&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />As far as your New York State criminal record is concerned, all misdemeanors and felonies will stay on your permanent record forever (if you were 19 years old or older when committed). Violations are sealed (including traffic tickets) here, except for three:
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- DWAI (VTL 1192 (1)) Driving While Your Ability Was Impaired
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- Solicitation of Prostitution
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- Sexual Solicitation
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;As far as your NYS DMV record, there are four time frames you should be aware of:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- Drug and alcohol related traffic infractions (VTL 1192 (2) DWI per se BAC .08 or more, VTL 1192 (2) (a) (a) Aggravated DWI per se BAC .18 or more, VTL 1192 (3) DWI common law, VTL 1192 (1) DWAI, DWAI drugs, DWAI drugs and alcohol) All stay on your DMV record for 10 YEARS.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- Violations/traffic infractions (not related to drugs or alcohol) stay on your NYS DMV record for 4 YEARS.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- All traffic violations (including alcohol and drug related) can be held against you by NYS insurance carriers (under NYS law) for 3 YEARS.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- All traffic violations which carry points or the potential for suspension and /or revocation of license privileges (speeds, following too closely, etc.) have an 18 Month look back period. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;

<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;First steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />When you get a parking ticket, formally known as a Penalty Charge Notice, you have the choice of paying within 14 days, in which case the fine is halved, or appeal the ticket.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The size of the fine depends on the offence committed. The typical fine for parking in the wrong place is Â£120 but this is halved to Â£60 if paid within 14 days.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />To appeal the ticket you need to send a letter to the council explaining that you are challenging the ticket, and why.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Grounds for appealing your ticket&lt;/b&gt;
<br />The legal grounds for appeal are as follows, and you must put your reason for appealing into one of these categories. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />1. The contravention did not occur (This covers misleading signs, non-visible signs &amp; markings, loading, in valid permit/parking voucher displayed, ticket was not issued etc.) 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />2. The penalty exceeded the relevant amount.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />3. The Traffic Regulation Order was invalid. (This only applies if the authority's regulations are legally defective)
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />4. I was not the owner of the vehicle when the alleged contravention occurred.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />5. The vehicle was taken without my consent (e.g. stolen) at the time the alleged contravention occurred. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />6. We are a hire company and have supplied the hirer's name and address.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;It's not your car&lt;/b&gt;
<br />This one is straightforward. Fines are directed to the registered owner of the vehicle. For cars that have recently been bought or sold, the Notice to Owner will be sent to the person who is registered as the owner at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA). If you have sold you car, the seller may not have updated the DVLA, so you should do it.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If you are appealing a ticket on these grounds, you need to provide contact details of whoever bought the vehicle from you, or whoever sold it to you.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;My car was stolen&lt;/b&gt;
<br />If you are appealing on the grounds your car was stolen when a ticket was issued, you will usually be required to provide a crime reference number when you appeal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;The fine is too big&lt;/b&gt;
<br />If you are fined by a parking attendant, rather than a private company, the penalty will be either Â£70, dropping to Â£35 if paid within 14 days, or Â£50, dropping to Â£25 if paid within 14 days, depending on the nature of the offence.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Fines issues in London can be Â£ 80, Â£100, or Â£120 - halved if paid within 14 days.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If your ticket exceeds these amounts you should phone the council to see if there is any reason why the ticket is more. If the fine exceeds the standard amount applicable in the area, you can appeal. See below for advice on tickets from private companies.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;They never put the ticket on my car&lt;/b&gt;
<br />It used to be the case that if you received a Notice to Owner in the post, but no ticket was applied to your car, then you could appeal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />For a ticket to stand, previously it had to have been physically applied to the car. So if you return to your car and find that a parking attendant is in the process of writing a ticket, you could drive off without being pursued for the offence. The attendant might say 'I have already started writing the ticket', or may ask that you wait while he completes it, but you are not required to remain at the scene.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Note that this only applied when the ticket is being issued by a parking attendant. Police officers and traffic wardens can also issue tickets, although the overwhelming majority is handed out by parking attendants.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Changes in the rules for parking tickets in April 2008 meant that this defense no longer applies, and councils may now send you a ticket through the post. However, if this happens the first thing you should do is request photographic evidence of the contravention.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If the council cannot supply this, then you can argue the contravention did not occur. Check the photo carefully against the actual area. Has it been cropped to make it misleading, does the picture actually show a contravention, is it marked with date and time, does it definitely show your car? In many instances, there may not be sufficient proof.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;They sent confirmation of the ticket too long after the offence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If a parking ticket is not paid within 14 days, a Notice to Owner is sent. If The Notice arrives more than 6 months after the alleged offence, you can appeal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;I had a valid ticket/permit&lt;/b&gt;
<br />If you had a ticket or permit to park when you got your parking fine, you can appeal. Parking attendants often take pictures of offending vehicles to show that a valid ticket was not displayed visibly, so be sure that you still have the ticket if you want to appeal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;They missed something off my ticket&lt;/b&gt;
<br />There are certain details that a Penalty Charge Notice must contain. It is invalid if it fails to state any of the following:
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- The reason for the ticket.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- The size of the fine 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- A statement that the penalty must be paid within 28 days, beginning with the date of the Penalty Charge Notice. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- A statement that if the penalty is paid within 14 days starting from the date of the Penalty Charge Notice, the amount of the penalty will be reduced by a specified amount.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- A statement that if the penalty charge is not paid before the end of the 28 day period a Notice to Owner may be served by the local authority on the owner of the car. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />- The address where the penalty charge must be sent. If any of these are missing, you can appeal.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;The parking bay was too small&lt;/b&gt;
<br />Tape measures at the ready. If your ticket was for 'parking outside of a marked bay', you should check the parking space met the minimum width. By law, a parking bay must be at least 1.62m wide, measured from the edge of the kerb to the outer edge of the white line.

<br />Have you ever wondered how many hours you've spent sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic? According to the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) at Texas A&amp;M University, you might spend as much as two weeks in your car each year.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The 2007 study revealed that in 28 urban areas, including cities like Boston, Detroit, Atlanta, San Francisco, Orlando and Minneapolis-St. Paul, drivers spent an entire work week sitting in traffic each year.Â­ In Los Angeles, the country's benchmark for traffic congestion, it could be up to nearly two weeks.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Traffic has serious consequences, and not just on your well-being. The estimated cost of traffic for 2005 was more than $78 billion (in fuel and wasted time), and that doesn't take into account factors like environmental damage or health coÂ­sts due to pollution. In fact, Americans bought 2.9 billion extra gallons of gas because of traffic congestion. The average annual cost to an individual driver was $710.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Many factors can contribute to traffic congestion, but the most basic explanation is that the number of drivers trying to use the same road is so high that it goes beyond the road's capacity to handle cars. That's a pretty simple explanation -- too many cars in Â­one place causes traffic. Unfortunately, the underlying reasons for too many cars in one place at one time are more complicated. University departments and civil engineers dedicate hundreds of hours and require millions of dollars in funding to understand how traffic congestion forms and what can be done about it.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />City planners, civil engineers, environmental advocacy groups, homeowner associations, politicians and the general population can have a significant impact on how we address traffic congestion. Traffic is a very political and sensitive issue since almost every proposed method of addressing it carries a hefty price tag, raising the question of who pays the bill.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />In this article, we'll learn about traffic congestion on highways and surface streets and the options city and state officials have when approaching traffic management. We'll look at ways you can help prevent traffic snarls through your own driving and car-maintenance habits. And in the last section, we'll find out which cities are known for the worst traffic.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Traffic Causes&lt;/b&gt;
<br />You can't understand it -- how can a five-lane highway become so packed? It feels as if every car in the city has joined you on the highway at the same time. Traffic creeps forward at a snail's pace, when it moves at all. You're forced to waste time, gas and money. What causes this?
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />As the first car stops, the following cars must also stop. Even when the first car begins to move again, additional approaching cars have to stop farther down the road and the congested area travels backward in a wave until traffic is light enough for it to dissipate.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />Assuming construction, accidents, and stalled vehicles aren't to blame, it's likely due to more cars entering the highway than leaving it. As more cars enter a crowded road, drivers have to use their brakes to avoid collisions, creating a traffic wave. A traffic wave occurs when cars slow down, and the slowing trend continues backward -- like a domino effect. As long as there are more cars approaching from behind, the traffic congestion travels in a wave.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />In general, you can divide up the contributors of traffic into two broad areas: network overload and traffic disturbances.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />&lt;b&gt;Network overload&lt;/b&gt; 
<br />If there are highways or surface streets that suffer from heavy traffic congestion, no matter what the actual road conditions might be, they fall into the category of network overload. These are the bottlenecks and traffic snarls where demand always outweighs capacity.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />As space opens up ahead of your car, you can accelerate and escape the congestion. The person behind you can accelerate a few moments later, and the person behind them a few moments after that. The congestion doesn't immediately clear up -- it continues to shift slowly back down the highway. Congestion can clear if traffic becomes light enough to stop the traffic-wave effect.
<br />&lt;br /&gt; 
<br />&lt;b&gt;Traffic disturbances&lt;/b&gt;
<br />Accidents and breakdowns, road construction and repair, and harsh weather conditions are all considered traffic disturbances. You can't always predict where these disturbances will occur, but they still heavily impact traffic flow.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />It's easy to imagine construction, an accident, or a cop giving a traffic ticket causing congestion -- drivers slow down either to change lanes or engage in a bit of rubbernecking as they try to see what happened. Road work might shut down one or more lanes, requiring drivers to shift over into open but crowded lanes. Bad weather might cause some drivers to maintain a slower driving speed out of concern for safety. According to the 2007 Urban Mobility Report from the Texas Transportation Institute, traffic incidents account for between 52 and 58 percent of the delays motorists' experience.

<br />Here in New York City, our vehicle traffic laws dictate that the statute of limitations on parking tickets is approximately eight years and three months. This means that the Parking Authority has a little over eight years to try to collect on outstanding parking tickets, likely employing a variety of methods -- warrants, towing, booting to do so.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />However, in Nassau County, there is no statute of limitations on parking tickets, meaning officials can conceivably come after you for as long as they wish.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />In fact, one woman who has long since left Nassau County recently received a bill for seven expired meter tickets issued 15 years ago.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />According to reports from WABC New York, an executive who chose to remain anonymous received a &quot;second final notice&quot; from the Nassau County Parking Authority informing her that she owed $920 on the seven tickets issued back in 1996, and that she risked ruined credit, arrest warrants and towing/booting if she failed to pay up.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />However, the woman indicated that she never received any prior warning and, more importantly, paid all the tickets back in 1996.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&quot;I have an excellent credit score, close to 800, I pay everything,&quot; said the woman. &quot;Again I can't just show any check because who retains checks for 15 years?&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Indeed, because banks are only legally required to keep records for seven years, there is no way to prove that she did pay the tickets or for the Parking Authority to prove that she didn't.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Interestingly, the sudden reappearance of the parking tickets may have something to do with a recent audit by the county comptroller, which determined that Nassau County has failed to collect upwards of $123 million in outstanding parking tickets dating all the way back to 1979.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&quot;They didn't do a good job collecting their parking tickets and so in an effort to recoup millions of dollars they lost in revenue while laying off people in Nassau County they are going after their lost revenue,&quot; said the woman said. &quot;It's more than a pain, it's just not fair.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Luckily for her, a crew from WABC New York spoke with the head of the Nassau County Parking Violation Agency on her behalf and convinced him to drop the price of the outstanding tickets from $920 to $120, eliminating 15 years of interest and penalties.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If you have been issued a traffic citation, fight to keep your driving privileges and your insurance premiums as low as possible. Consider contacting an attorney who understands New York's confusing legal system, and who can help you evaluate your options and make the right decisions.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;

<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF DWI CHARGES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If you are charged with driving while intoxicated in Suffolk County the consequences of such charges vary depending upon whether an individual takes the breathalyzer as well as the results of the breathalyzer results. Also the outcome of your case can be significantly impacted if there was an accident. Driving while intoxicated is a misdemeanor. A misdemeanor is a crime punishable by up to one year in jail and or 3 years probation or what is called a conditional discharge. A conditional discharge is you stay out of trouble for one year with the condition that you maintain yourself as a law-abiding citizen.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If the breathalyzer results are very high .16 or greater and this is an individual's first time in getting charged with driving while intoxicated then there is a possibility that there may be no probation and the person will get what is called a conditional discharge.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If an individual refuses the breathalyzer test, then the offer from the district attorney will be as charged a misdemeanor. Oftentimes there is a possibility of an individual getting a conditional discharge without probation. However the standard offer for an individual charged with driving while intoxicated with a breathalyzer results greater than .12 would be as charged and 3 years probation as well as if you refuse to take the breathalyzer test.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If an individual's breathalyzer results are between .08 and .09 in some instances we are able to have the charges reduced from driving while intoxicated down to a traffic infraction called an imprudent speed a three-point ticket.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If an individual receives a 2nd DWI charge within 10 years regardless of the breathalyzer results there will not be a reduction of the charges from anything less than the misdemeanor driving while intoxicated. Additionally when an individual is charged with DWI and the individual takes the breathalyzer. The judge suspends an individual's license at arraignment. If the breathalyzer is not too high a hearing will be scheduled within a matter of days of being arraigned on the charges. This hearing is called a hardship hearing. At the hardship hearing an individual needs to be represented by an attorney and show proof that driving without a license is a hardship, if a hardship license is not granted an individual will be eligible for a conditional license 30 days after the DWI arraignment.

<br />The new law will include a series of provisions to overhaul the way prescription drugs are distributed and tracked in New York State, including enacting a â€œreal time&quot; prescription monitoring registry to provide timely and enhanced information to practitioners and pharmacists; requiring all prescriptions to be electronically transmitted; improving safeguards for the distribution of specific prescription drugs that are prone to abuse; charging a workgroup of stakeholders with the responsibility to help guide the development of medical education courses and other public awareness measures regarding pain management and prescription drugs; and requiring the Department of Health to establish a safe disposal program for unused medications.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />â€œThis landmark agreement will help put a stop to the growing number of fatalities resulting from overdoses on prescription drugs,&quot; Governor Cuomo said. â€œWe have seen too many untimely deaths as a result of prescription drug abuse, and today New York State is taking the lead in saying enough is enough. I commend Attorney General Schneiderman, Majority Leader Skelos, and Speaker Silver for their hard work in putting together this groundbreaking reform package that will help protect New Yorkers and put an end to prescription drug abuse.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said, â€œThis is a major victory for the people of New York. With I-STOP, we will create a national model for smart, coordinated communication between health care providers and pharmacists to better serve patients, stop prescription drug trafficking, and provide treatment to those who need help. I applaud the Governor, Assembly and Senate for agreeing to take action and curb the prescription drug crisis that has impacted families in every corner of this state. Now, New York will be a national leader in protecting the public from the devastating consequences of prescription drug abuse.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos said, â€œThe effects of prescription drug abuse are being felt all across this state, especially among young people who are using painkillers to disastrous consequences. I commend Senator Lanza, who has championed this bill for more than three years, and Senator Hannon, the Chairman of the Senate Health Committee, for recognizing early on that a legislative remedy was a critical and necessary step. I thank the Governor, the Attorney General, and our colleagues in the Assembly for working with us to lead the charge in cracking down on prescription drug abuse so New Yorkers are better protected.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said, â€œPrescription drug abuse has become a pervasive problem in communities across the state. This legislation will help to control prescription drug abuse by creating a real-time online database enabling doctors and pharmacists to track certain controlled substances. This initiative will ensure patients receive the medication they need and deter those who seek to abuse them. I applaud Governor Cuomo for his leadership on this issue and commend Attorney General Schneiderman and my colleagues in the legislature for supporting this important life saving measure.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Senator Andrew Lanza said, â€œThis historic agreement will allow New York to be at the forefront of the battle against the prescription drug abuse epidemic, which has destroyed families and lives from one end of the state to the other. The agreed upon legislation will allow doctors and pharmacists to have the information they need to ensure that we turn the tide on this deadly crisis. I thank the Governor, Attorney General Schneiderman, Senator Skelos, the Speaker, Senator Hannon and Assemblyman Cusick for working so long and so hard in this cooperative effort.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Senator Kemp Hannon said, â€œComprehensive action to address the misuse of painkiller drugs in New York is needed. In the last documented year, over 22 million prescriptions for painkilling drugs were written - without refills - in a state with only 19 1/2 million people. The cooperation and collaboration evidenced by this legislation marks the beginning, not the conclusion of a concentrated effort to bring a balance to these drugs. This bill reflects the Senate's work as evidenced by our two roundtables and a report, addressing the number one health crisis today.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Assembly Member Michael Cusick said, â€œI want to thank Governor Cuomo, Attorney General Schneiderman, Speaker Silver and all of my colleagues who worked together to craft this agreement. This is meaningful legislation that provides an essential tool to allow for the responsible dispensation of prescriptions by medical professionals and pharmacists. It will protect access to critical medication for patients who truly need it. But at the same time, appropriate controls will be implemented to restrict access of abusers and ensure those who profit from the abuse face the necessary consequences.&quot;
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Illicit use of prescription medicine has become one of the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 15,000 people die every year of overdoses due to prescription painkillers. In 2010, 1 in 20 people in the United States over the age of 11 reported using prescription painkillers for nonmedical reasons in the past year. During the period 1999 through 2008, overdose death rates, sales, and substance abuse treatment admissions related to prescription painkillers all increased substantially. Sales of opioid painkillers quadrupled between 1999 and 2010. Enough opioid painkillers were prescribed in 2010 to medicate every American adult with 5mg of hydrocodone every four hours for a month. Moreover, an estimated 70 percent of people who abuse prescription painkillers obtained them from friends or relatives who originally received the medication from a prescription. The problem is of particular concern with respect to young adults and teens.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Details of the legislation are as follows:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The Creation of a New and Updated Prescription Monitoring Program (I-STOP)
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The legislation will require updating and modernization of Department of Health (DOH)'s Prescription Monitoring program (PMP) Registry to make it one of the best systems in the nation to monitor prescription drug abuse and to help the medical community provide better care. The new system will substantially decrease opportunities for â€œdoctor shoppers&quot; to illegally obtain prescriptions from multiple practitioners. The legislation requires enhancement and modernization of DOH's secure prescription monitoring program registry, which will include information about dispensed controlled substances reported by pharmacies on a â€œreal time&quot; basis, to effectively stop doctor shopping and combat the circulation of illegally-obtained prescription drugs.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The PMP Registry will be secure and easily accessible by practitioners and pharmacists, allowing them to view their patients' controlled substance history. In addition, this legislation strikes the right balance by requiring health care practitioners to consult the PMP Registry before prescribing or dispensing the controlled substances that are most prone to abuse and diversion, while exempting practitioners from consulting in specific situations in order to protect patient access to needed medications. Moreover, pharmacists, for the first time, will now be able to consult the PMP Registry before dispensing a controlled substance.

<br />If you want to reduce your contribution to traffic jams, the first thing you should do is take care of your car. Making sure your car is properly maintained can help prevent breakdowns on the road. Maintenance includes regular oil changes, tune ups and tire care. Make sure your tires are kept at the right pressure -- it's safer and can improve your gas mileage by up to 3.3 percent [source: fueleconomy.org]. Keeping your car in good working order will save you time and money and might help keep you out of dangerous situations.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />When on the road, try to maintain a safe and steady distance between you and the driver ahead of you. Suddenly speeding up -- only to slow down again cause's drivers behind you to do the same thing, eventually resulting in a congestion wave and road rage.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />In an article titled &quot;Vision of Congestion-Free Road Traffic and Cooperating Objects,&quot; Ricardo Morla proposes we think of cars occupying virtual slots. Each virtual slot takes up a real space that travels at a specific, continuous speed down the road. As cars approach one another, drivers must adjust the speed of their cars so that the virtual slots don't overlap. Moral admits that this system fails whenever more cars enter a highway than the virtual slots can accommodate. Still, by keeping a safe distance between you and other vehicles, you can help minimize congestion.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Driving at non-peak rush-hour times is another good way to avoid contributing to the congestion problem. If you have flexibility with your schedule, you can travel at non-peak hours. Proponents of the congestion-pricing system say that levying fees on drivers during peak hours would encourage people to drive at off-peak times. Critics point out that this comes close to regressive taxation, meaning that the poor shoulder most of the cost. They say that people with flexible schedules tend to be professionals working in white-collar jobs, whereas people who work in lower-paying positions tend to have set hours and are unable to avoid traffic. The people least able to afford the fee would be the ones footing the bill.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Carpooling is a great option if you live near people who work near you. Most cities have HOV lanes you can use, and carpooling createsÂ­ less stress on the environment, leading to less pollution. Many people are reluctant to give up the freedom they have when driving their own car. Carpooling means aligning your schedule with other people and scheduling any errands or side trips after you get back home.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />If your city has a good public transportation system, you can always use it to reduce your impact on congestion. But just like carpooling, using public transportation means giving up some of your freedom and flexibility.

<br />Many cities, like Los Angeles, have sophisticated traffic communications systems that alert drivers to changing conditions on the road, giving them time to decide what to do. Several cities have invested millions of dollars so that road crews can rapidly travel to trouble spots.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;There are a few ways cities can address highway congestion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Ramp metering - cars are only allowed to enter the highway at timed intervals. This is done by placing a light similar to a traffic signal at the end of the ramp. Cities using ramp metering report a travel-delay reduction of 29.4 million hours annually with a significant decrease in traffic accidents -- yet capacity on the highway actually increased when ramp metering was introduced [source: TTI]. In Minnesota, the DOT instituted a strict ramp-metering program that included 430 ramp meters. As an experiment, the DOT shut off the ramp meters for seven weeks in 2000. During that time, traffic accidents increased by 26 percent. After the experiment, the DOT reinstituted the ramp meters and saw highway capacity increase by 14 percent. Though ramp metering can increase highway speeds while decreasing accidents, it usually takes a long time to implement and requires thorough investigation to make sure surface street traffic isn't affected as cars back up to enter the highway. 
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />High-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) - many cities have included these lanes on highways. HOV lanes are reserved for cars with a certain number of passengers (usually two or three people per car). Drivers have an incentive to carpool, reducing the total number of cars on the highway. Some HOV lanes have exclusive off-ramps, reducing the need to merge with other traffic.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Adding lanes - a common approach to congestion problems is to add lanes to the highway, either by widening the road, decreasing the width of existing lanes or converting a shoulder or other space into a lane. These sort of adjustments are expensive, time consuming and controversial. Several studies suggest that increasing the width of a road only increases the volume of cars without addressing congestion. Other studies say that in many circumstances, widening the road can greatly reduce congestion. According to TTI's extensive research, adding lanes and widening roads only works if capacity stays ahead of population growth.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Traffic Control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Most reports on congestion focus on highways, but surface streets can have their own share of problems, particularly as suburban populations increase.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Civil engineers have to take many factors into consideration when designing for surface streets. For instance, a poorly designed intersection can be inconvenient or unsafe. Consider all the different elements a civil engineer must tend to: a driver's line of sight, the impact the intersection will have on the streets surrounding it, the amount of traffic the intersection is likely to see and other issues.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Another challenge is suburban sprawl neighborhoods that were once less populated might experience a growth spurt accompanied by new needs in road design.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Most cities have a well-established system of roads, making extensive changes impractical or even impossible. It's easy to make suggestions to solve a city's traffic problems, but implementing solutions can be prohibitively expensive. Perhaps the easiest way to make an impact on city traffic is through traffic lights.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Traffic lights typically are on a timed system, a sensor system or a combination of the two. Timed systems follow a set schedule no matter what traffic conditions are like (though the schedule itself might change throughout the day). Sensor systems detect cars as they pull up to the intersection, which triggers a change in the traffic light. Advanced traffic systems network signals to a master computer system. A good system uses signals that are timed together so that the flow of traffic remains as constant as possible. However, even a well-designed traffic coordination system will only reduce traffic delay by approximately 1 percent.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Another way to control traffic dispersal within the city is to institute turn prohibitions and auto-restricted zones. Turn prohibitions mean you can't turn at specific intersections or points on a road, which channels traffic into alternate routes. Auto-restricted zones are areas where cars aren't allowed at all, usually to facilitate pedestrian traffic or preserve a historic district in a city or town. In Boston, for example, you can find the Downtown Crossing Project, an auto-restricted zone encompassing 12 city blocks.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />A true congestion-pricing system would track each driver as he maneuvered around city streets using an electronic system of sensors. Each car would have an electronic identifier unique to the vehicle, similar to a radio frequency identification tag. Rates might vary throughout the day, generally reaching the highest point around rush hour. Driving on city streets during this time results in a fine. Because no congestion-pricing systems currently exist, there are no specific rates or fine-collection techniques to speak of at this time. Critics of congestion-pricing systems point out that such a system would likely be a political impossibility because drivers have become used to driving on city streets for free. A similar system in Seoul, Korea faced massive public opposition, including charges that the city was imposing a tax on drivers.

<br />Whenever you enter a query in a search engine and hit 'enter' you get a list of web results that contain that query term. Users normally tend to visit websites that are at the top of this list as they perceive those to be more relevant to the query. If you have ever wondered why some of these websites rank better than the others then you must know that it is because of a powerful web marketing technique called Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />SEO is a technique which helps search engines find and rank your site higher than the millions of other sites in response to a search query. SEO thus helps you get traffic from search engines.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />This SEO tutorial covers all the necessary information you need to know about Search Engine Optimization - what is it, how does it work and differences in the ranking criteria of major search engines.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;How Search Engines Work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />The first basic truth you need to know to learn SEO is that search engines are not humans. While this might be obvious for everybody, the differences between how humans and search engines view web pages aren't. Unlike humans, search engines are text-driven. Although technology advances rapidly, search engines are far from intelligent creatures that can feel the beauty of a cool design or enjoy the sounds and movement in movies. Instead, search engines crawl the Web, looking at particular site items (mainly text) to get an idea what a site is about. This brief explanation is not the most precise because as we will see next, search engines perform several activities in order to deliver search results - crawling, indexing, processing, calculating relevancy, and retrieving.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />First, search engines crawl the Web to see what is there. This task is performed by a piece of software, called a crawler or a spider (or Googlebot, as is the case with Google). Spiders follow links from one page to another and index everything they find on their way. Having in mind the number of pages on the Web (over 20 billion), it is impossible for a spider to visit a site daily just to see if a new page has appeared or if an existing page has been modified, sometimes crawlers may not end up visiting your site for a month or two.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />After a page is crawled, the next step is to index its content. The indexed page is stored in a giant database, from where it can later be retrieved. Essentially, the process of indexing is identifying the words and expressions that best describe the page and assigning the page to particular keywords. For a human it will not be possible to process such amounts of information but generally search engines deal just fine with this task. Sometimes they might not get the meaning of a page right but if you help them by optimizing it, it will be easier for them to classify your pages correctly and for you - to get higher rankings.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />When a search request comes, the search engine processes it - i.e. it compares the search string in the search request with the indexed pages in the database. Since it is likely that more than one page (practically it is millions of pages) contains the search string, the search engine starts calculating the relevancy of each of the pages in its index with the search string.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />There are various algorithms to calculate relevancy. Each of these algorithms has different relative weights for common factors like keyword density, links, or metatags. That is why different search engines give different search results pages for the same search string. What is more, it is a known fact that all major search engines, like Yahoo!, Google, Bing, etc. periodically change their algorithms and if you want to keep at the top, you also need to adapt your pages to the latest changes. This is one reason (the other is your competitors) to devote permanent efforts to SEO, if you'd like to be at the top.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />&lt;b&gt;Differences between Search Engines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
<br />Although the basic principle of operation of all search engines is the same, the minor differences between them lead to major changes in results relevancy. For different search engines different factors are important. There were times, when SEO experts joked that the algorithms of Bing are intentionally made just the opposite of those of Google. While this might have a grain of truth, it is a matter a fact that the major search engines like different stuff and if you plan to conquer more than one of them, you need to optimize carefully.
<br />&lt;br /&gt;
<br />There are many examples of the differences between search engines. For instance, for Yahoo! and Bing, on-page keyword factors are of primary importance, while for Google links are very, very important. Also, for Google sites are like wine - the older, the better, while Yahoo! generally has no expressed preference towards sites and domains with tradition (i.e. older ones). Thus you might need more time till your site gets mature to be admitted to the top in Google, than in Yahoo!.

Japanese and Chinese beads are uniform while the Czech beads are uneven in their shape. They are small in size and can be kept in a bag or tubes. Larger beads are available in loose form at cheap prices but they are heavy in weight. . Actually the size of the bead depends on its type and material.

<br />&lt;p &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beaded Jewelry Making &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p &gt;Before it was possible to smelt steel and defeat it into shape for jewelry and anklet wristbands, pill anklet wristbands was being made. Nothing easier than to take eye-catching and light-weight seashells or plant legumes, cut them with an awl or other distinct device, and sequence them around one's hands, hands or neck. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p &gt;Seashell pellets used for anklet wristbands have been found that are over 100,000 years old, showing that people have wanted to enhance their bodies with wonderful anklet wristbands since the beginning of time. A handmade anklet wristbands developer today can create unique pieces designed for modern times, or homage to the cultural and traditional styles of the past. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;White sapphire is a variety of the gemstone a colorless form of sapphire used in a variety of jewelry as a precious stone alternative. Sapphires are generally much less expensive than gemstones. Most white-colored sapphires are heat treated to obtain the preferred clear color; this is done by heating the sapphires in ovens to temperatures between 500 and 1800 &amp;deg;C for several hours, or by heating in a nitrogen-deficient atmosphere oven for seven days or more. as it is very difficult to find natural white-colored sapphires. Some may also be chemically treated, with regards to the quality of the stone and its indented use. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Sapphires are a type of corundum, which is a crystalline form of an &amp;nbsp; aluminum oxide(Al 2 &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOxygen%26quot%3B%26gt%3BO"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen&quot;&gt;O</a> &lt;/a&gt;3 ) which forms in a crystalline pattern. Presence of other elements like &amp;nbsp; iron, &amp;nbsp; titanium, &amp;nbsp; chromium, &amp;nbsp; copper &amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp; magnesium &amp;nbsp;give different color. When corundum is red, it is known as ruby. When it appears in other colors, it is called sapphire. Sapphire is the birthstone for September and has been around since ancient times. White Sapphire provokes purity and fearlessness. It also enhances artistic abilities and purifies our passions. It is believed that natural white sapphire gemstone has strong power to ward of evil, and is sometimes used as a talisman. It is an Oriental belief that just gazing at white sapphire brings good luck.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;White sapphires are valued for their ability to unlock the creative and artistic capabilities of a person.&amp;nbsp; It is also said to make a person more attractive and charismatic because it represents the planet Venus which is by itself representative of love, beauty and artistic qualities. Also, White Sapphire generates keenness towards creative endeavors and increases the flow of wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;It is a very durable stone, It can be cleaned with warm water, soft brush and detergent. Also, ultrasonic or steam cleaners do not harm White Sapphire and most commonly comes in shades of blue. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;White sapphire does not contain the iron, titanium or chromium that gives other sapphires color. White sapphire is authentic sapphire that is colorless and has similar hardness as blue sapphires and sapphires in other colors. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
<br />    &lt;br&gt;
<br />  There are two major resources for white sapphires. Grayish to light yellow-colored organic stones may be treated to become clear, and some companies also develop their own sapphires, developing artificial sapphires which are chemically similar to the genuine thing. A artificial white-colored sapphires tends to be less expensive, because customers consider lab-cultured gemstones as substandard, but it may sometimes be of better quality, thanks to the managed increasing circumstances. Natural sapphires are found in South eastern Asia, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Africa, the middle East, and in the united states. The value of White Sapphire depends on its size, color and transparency. Not only its fine quality but its origin also plays a major role. The most priceless are authentic Kashmir stones. Then comes Burmese sapphires and then sapphires from Ceylon. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical properties Natural White Sapphire Gemstone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The White Sapphire has a hardness of 9 and a refractive index of 1.766 - 1.774. It has a dispersion of 0.018, all qualities which are just a little lower than that of diamonds. It is a gemstone variety belonging to the â€˜corundum' species. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;The Nassau County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency is the &amp;nbsp; Nassau County Traffic Court . It is an uncommon practice , and the only court of its type in the New York. As the title indicates, this traffic court manages a lot of the speeding tickets and other traffic infractions and parking violations in Nassau, maybe most of them. You do have to appear for certain types of cases, like repeat offenses, leaving accident scenes, moving large yellow-colored automobiles with kids and flashing lights, and other extraordinarily naughty actions. Parking and traffic tickets are the staple diet of the Traffic Court, but that must not be a surprise. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;At the &amp;nbsp; Law Office. , the Defense of Traffic Tickets is taken extremely seriously. Although most Traffic Tickets are not criminal in nature the consequences of a conviction can have long lasting effects. Traffic Felony prosecutions can cause to any one of, or a variety of the following:: &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;â€¢ &amp;nbsp; A Suspended or Revoked Drivers License . &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Increased Insurance Premiums for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Termination of your Auto Insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;â€¢ A &amp;nbsp; Drivers Responsibility Assessment &amp;nbsp; Fee payable to the DMV for 3 years. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Points on your Driver's License &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; The failing to response a Traffic Ticket can result in the suspension of your driver's license. If you are subsequently stopped by the police for a traffic violation while you are operating a motor vehicle you can be arrested and charged with a criminal offense. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;If you obtain more then ten points in any 18 month period, your driver's license will be suspended by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Points are computed by the Department of Motor Vehicles from the date the summons is issued, not the date of conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Commercial truck and other drivers from Nassau County and parts of New York City have come to rely on the Law Offices for aggressive representation and convenience in handling traffic violation charges. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The local and municipal court system of Nassau County attends to traffic related crimes. They provide the option for plea-bargaining, which gives us more flexibility and legal options in negotiating the charges or moving forward with litigation. The municipalities in Nassau County can negotiate the traffic violation and even the fine amounts that they assess. There is a great deal of give and take, which is advantageous to you. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;If you receive a traffic ticket in Nassau, Suffolk or any other New York county, you may think it's easiest just to pay the fine and be done with it. However, due to the New York Department of Motor Vehicles' points system, paying a fine and accepting the charges can turn out to cost you a great deal down the road. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;Search engines are one of the primary ways that Internet users find Web sites. That's why a Web site with good search engine listings may see a dramatic increase in traffic. Everyone wants those good listings. Unfortunately, many Web sites appear poorly in search engine rankings or may not be listed at all because they fail to consider how search engines work. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;In particular, submitting to search engines is only part of the challenge of getting good search engine positioning. It's also important to prepare a Web site through &amp;quot;search engine optimization.&amp;quot; Search engine optimization means ensuring that your Web pages are accessible to search engines and are focused in ways that help improve the chances they will be found. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Search Engines Work &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;search engine&amp;quot; is often used generically to describe both crawler-based search engines and human-powered directories. These two types of search engines gather their listings in radically different ways. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Engines: The Same, But Different &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;All crawler-based search engines have the basic parts described above, but there are differences in how these parts are tuned. That is why the same search on different search engines often produces different results. Some of the significant differences between the major crawler-based search engines are summarized on the Search Engine Features Page. Information on this page has been drawn from the help pages of each search engine, along with knowledge gained from articles, reviews, books, independent research, tips from others and additional information received directly from the various search engines. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Placement Tips &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;A query on a crawler-based search engine often turns up thousands or even millions of matching web pages. In many cases, only the ten most &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot; matches are displayed on the first page. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Naturally, anyone who runs a web site wants to be in the &amp;quot;top ten&amp;quot; results. This is because most users will find a result they like in the top ten. Being listed 11 or beyond means that many people may miss your web site. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The tips below will help you come closer to this goal, both for the keywords you think are important, and for phrases you may not even be anticipating. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick Your Target Keywords &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;How do you think people will search for your web page? The words you imagine them typing into the search box are your target keywords. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Your target keywords should always be at least two or more words long. Usually, too many sites will be relevant for a single word, such as &amp;quot;stamps.&amp;quot; This &amp;quot;competition&amp;quot; means your odds of success are lower. Don't waste your time fighting the odds. Pick phrases of two or more words, and you'll have a better shot at success. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The Researching Keywords article provides additional information about selecting key terms. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position of your Keywords &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Make sure your target keywords appear in the crucial locations on your web pages. The page's HTML title tag is most important. Failure to put target keywords in the title tag is the main reason why perfectly relevant web pages may be poorly ranked. More about the title tag can be found on the How to Use HTML Meta Tags page. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Build your titles around the top two or three phrases that you would like the page to be found for. The titles should be relatively short and attractive. Think of newspaper headlines. With a few words, they make you want to read a story. Similarly, your page titles are like headlines for your pages. They appear in search engine listings, and a short, attractive title may help encourage users to click through to your site. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Search engines also like pages where keywords appear &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; on the page, as described more fully on the Search Engine Ranking page. To accommodate them, use your target keywords for your page headline, if possible. Have them also appear in the first paragraphs of your web page. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you look online there's another article about search engine optimization, or as it's more commonly known â€œSEO&quot;. No matter what you're selling or what business you're in, SEO has been the buzzword/all the rage for a few years now. SEO refers to a process that allows websites to increase traffic, gain market share, eliminate liver spots and save a whaleâ€¦ Problem is, it's been so ingrained in website owners' minds that many have over-optimized their sites. They actually started building sites for search engine ranking instead of for actual USERS. Here are 10 examples of how an SEO can go just a bit too far: &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keyword Stuffing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most common form of â€œover-optimization&quot; among offending websites. It is the overuse of words or phrases that are relevant to either the website itself, or to the search parameters used by surfers whom the website is targeting, in order to increase ranking for those terms. If you are still doing this and somehow survived the many Google panda updates I am sure your days are numbered. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Text &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;This is basically another means of keyword stuffing, only it's done in such a way that it isn't visible to the reader. It will, however, be indexed by search engine crawlers, and is typically done by masking the text. This is accomplished by using a font color that matches the background. There are basically no circumstances where this should ever be legitimately required. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over-use of Backlinks &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The idea behind backlinks is that the more sites out there that you have out there linking to your site, the more popular your site must be, and therefore the more value your content is perceived to have. The problem is that sheer numbers of links don't speak to quality of content, and if your site backlinks to a lot of useless pages/content; then it's just gaming the system. As we have all seen with the Google penguin updates though, some backlinks can be very harmful (tip: Google negative SEO as well and see how many hits you get). There is such a thing as a backlink you can and should refuse! &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak Links &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if your page has too many weak links out to other websites, especially above the fold, for the purpose of ranking for a partner (link swapping, reciprocal link exchanges, etc.), the website will be viewed as overly-optimized by Google at the very least, and probably your visitors too. This just looks cheesey and is a super dated technique any way, just delete any reciprocal link exchange pages you have as they are not helping you. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forcing What Should Come Naturally &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Link building and optimization should take place in the form of building a network between your site and other related destinations that appeal to surfers looking for what you provide. In other words, â€˜if you build it, they will come' - and that doesn't mean links, it means quality content. People have used techniques like creating mini sites to link to their sites and using large blog networks to link to their sites, but this is not natural and eventually Google will catch on and your site will suffer. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content That is Keyword-Driven &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;You've no doubt seen examples of this, where the content is written so awkwardly that it becomes unreadable. And it's done for nothing more than the sake of repeating a keyword phrase umpteen times in the space of two paragraphs. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchor Text &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;When your backlinks all have the same anchor text, regardless of where they are linking to, that's a give-away sign that you are over-optimizing. Naturally obtained backlinks will vary in their anchor text and sometimes will just be to a literal page on your site as that is what a person naturally linking to your resource would do. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doorway Pages &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;This is the use of a web page that is designed strictly for search engines, and provides no content for the viewer. Its only purpose is to redirect users to one's website and increase ranking. This technique used to be heavily used by affiliate marketers but it has been rendered almost useless by the various recent Google updates. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Many Ads &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Yes, ads earn revenue, but having too many above the fold, especially if they aren't relevant to the page content smacks of over-optimization. Quality content needs to be the foremost consideration in that crucial area. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Many Links with Same Content &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;When you create links to pages on your website that are essentially duplicates of another page, or one for each keyword, it's definitely a case of over-optimizing your website. The simple rule you should always live by is to never duplicate content (content you wrote included). &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;1)The first vehicle to the intersection has the right of way; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;2) When two or more vehicles reach an intersection at the same time, the vehicle to the right has the right of way; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;3) The vehicle with the right of way may move straight ahead or, if legal, may turn right or left after signaling; &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;4) If one driver is going straight while the other wants to turn left, the driver who wants to turn left must wait. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;5) Even with the right of way, remember to use the appropriate turn signals and be careful to avoid hitting other vehicles and pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A traffic ticket is a notice issued by a law enforcement official to a motorist or other road user, accusing violation of traffic laws. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the United States, most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Traffic Court handles cases that usually begin when a citation or ticket is written by a law enforcement officer. Tickets can be issued for violations of traffic laws and other non-traffic offenses. Parking tickets are NOT handled by the Traffic Division. These are handled exclusively by the local city or the Los Angeles Parking Violations Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Most tickets can be resolved without appearing a court and can be managed using Online Services or by phone. You may have a lawyer present if you must appear in court but you are not entitled to court appointed counsel for traffic infraction matters. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The back of your traffic ticket contains information on how to answer the ticket. You must respond to the ticket to prevent a suspension of your driver license or driving privileges. It is a crime to drive with a suspended or revoked license . Local courts handle traffic tickets for moving violations in most parts of New York State. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;How to Pay Traffic tickets: &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt; Turn the ticket over and read the back of it. Most tickets will have contact information on the back of the ticket. Check option - &amp;quot;if you wish to plead guilty.&amp;quot; Go through the instructions that regarding this section. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Pay your traffic ticket over the phone. This is especially popular in the big cities now. There is usually a toll-free number on the back of the ticket. Simply call the number and follow the instructions. At the end of the call, you have enter your credit-card info and down the confirmation Number. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Log on to your computer and pay the traffic ticket online .. That, of course, doesn't mean you don't have to pay the fine. When you log on, it will instruct you to enter a credit card, which it will charge the traffic ticket. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;You will then need the citation number on your ticket. You will: &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Select the court where your ticket is assigned &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Select the law enforcement agency &amp;nbsp; that issued your ticket &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Enter the citation number from your ticket &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Enter your birth date &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Your ticket information and eligible online options will appear. Select the Appearance Date Extension option if it is shown. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;You can use Search by Driver's License if you do not have your citation number. You can select your ticket from the list and proceed by selecting the payment option if it is shown. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Pay in person. On the back of the traffic ticket, you will be told which courthouse you can appear at to contest the ticket. At the courthouse, you can also pay for your violation. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;If you get one or two continues moving violations - such as running a stop light or speeding -- your driver license won't be suspended. Usually, your license isn't at risk unless you've been convicted of at least three moving violations in the past three to five years -- specifics depend on the your state. In some states, just one moving violation can result in license suspension for drivers under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point Systems &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Most states handle driver license suspensions using a system that defines point system for each type of moving violation. If you get too many points in a certain period of time, you are at risk of losing your license. In some states, motor vehicle accidents can result in points as well, even if no fault determination was ever made by a court or law enforcement agency. &lt;/p&gt;

<br />&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how watchmakers repair your watch? &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Watches fall into two basic categories: electronic and mechanical &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;Many of the earlier quartz watches were digital readout, either LED (Light Emitting Diode) or LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).Now a days quartz watches are workings as analog watches with mechanical hands moving.Quartz watch use cell, electric circuit borad and quartz crystal to generate the timing pulse and a coil to transfer the electronic energy to mechanical to rotates the hands . &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;The &amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;mechanical watch &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; is made up of a power source (Mainspring) and a power train of rack and pinions, gears like the quartz watch. The energy is transferred to the dial side of the watch and the time is displayed by hands being driven by the dial train. &lt;/p&gt;
<br />&lt;ul&gt;
<br />  &lt;li&gt;Watches should be serviced on a regular schedule every 24 to 36 months to remove the old sticky oil and dirt and clean and re-lube them to keep them running best as possible and to prolong their life. &lt;br&gt;
<br />&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;

<br />&lt;/ul&gt;
<br />&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
