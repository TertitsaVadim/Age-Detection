<br /><br />-- When you chew gum before you kiss, it actually makes your breath SMELL WORSE than before because of your salivary glands...
<br /><br />// Mints work MUCH better. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
<br /><br />`*GUYS; It is much more ROMANTiC to kiss girls in a fancy restaurant or UNDER THE STARS than to kiss in your disgusting bedroom or in the movie theaters
<br /><br />`*GiRLS; Just because a guy kisses you every 10 minutes doesn't mean he’s using you ...he's just a little horny &amp;&amp; there`s no problem with that !!!
<br /><br />-- It has been PR0VEN that when people with the SAME Hair C0L0R kiss, it is more R0MANTiC than that of a different hair color!!!
<br /><br />[(WE D0NT KNOW WHY)]
<br /><br />-- your First Kiss isn’t always your BEST Kiss
<br /><br />-- If you can tie a KN0T in a CHERRY with your tongue, it doesn't mean you are a good kisser .. it just means your TOUNGE MUSCLE is strong
<br /><br />-- ALL GiRLS are NOT hoes, and ALL GUYS are NOT PLAYERS .. EVERYONE gets a LiTTLE H0RNY sometimes
<br /><br />BE A GREAT KiSSER W/ THESE TiPS
<br /><br />-- T0UCH HiS/HER FACE
<br /><br />-- RUN Y0UR FiNGERS THR0UGH HiS/HER HAiR
<br /><br />-- KiSS S0FTLY AT FiRST, THEN APPLY M0RE PRESSURE
<br /><br />-- H0LD Y0UR KiSSiNG PARTNER
<br /><br />Kissing Language (yup, it's a language)
<br />if a kiss is the Language of Love,
<br />then we have a lot to talk about it...
<br /><br />methods of Love....
<br /><br />+kiss on the ear--------------------&quot;i'm horny&quot;
<br />+kiss on the cheek-----------------&quot;we're friends&quot;
<br />+kiss on the hand------------------&quot;i adore you&quot;
<br />+kiss on the neck-------------------&quot;we belong together&quot;
<br />+kiss on the shoulder--------------&quot;i want you now&quot;
<br />+kiss on the lips---------------------&quot;i love you&quot; or &quot;i want you&quot;
<br />+holding hands-----------------------&quot;we can learn to love each other&quot;
<br />+a wink---------------------------------&quot;Let's get it on&quot;
<br />+slap on the butt---------------------&quot;thats mine&quot;
<br />+playing with the ear----------------&quot;i can't live without you&quot;
<br />+holding on tight---------------------&quot;don't let go&quot;
<br />+looking into each other's eyes---&quot;let's get romantic&quot;
<br />+playing with hair on head---------------&quot;tell me you love me&quot;
<br />+arms around the waist -----------&quot;i love you too much to let go&quot;
<br />+laughing while kissing-----------&quot;i am completley comfortable w/you&quot;
<br /><br />=advice=
<br />***if you're kissing someone, close your eyes. it's not nice to stare...
<br /><br />=requirements=
<br />post this again after reading!!...or you'll have a bad year of relationship
<br /><br />If you REALLY LIKE (or LOVE) SOMEONE right now AND MISS THEM and can't get them out of your head or ur crushin on someone then re-post this within 1 minute and whoever you are missing will surprise you tomorrow
