(2011 Update) - Careers<br/><br/>Even those nurses having less experience are offered better compensation packages. Also since this profession is an experience driven field the compensation only gets higher and the anesthetist nurse salary only goes up with time. Those nurses who have years of practical experience and are single-handedly administering the anesthesia procedures without the supervision of senior doctor are the highest paid nurses.<br />Method#3: Don't forget to consider all benefits to be additional compensation when looking at nurse base salary. As costs rise, many employers shift a greater portion of your health insurance premium cost to employees. In many cases the split is 80/20. This shift results in a lowering of actual take-home pay. In a few cases, employers may pay 100% of the premium to compensate for a rigid salary structure.<br />These types of jobs are in demand of well-qualified nurses who can handle the situations that generally come up where they are sent to work. Their skills and authenticity are verified by the several documents that are required at the time of application. These documents are verified by the government and official medical organizations. The paperwork is put together in what is called a profile and can include medical licenses, immunization certificates, health certificates and the like. A nurse's eligibility is determined by this record, or profile, of credentials.<br />To start off, therefore, you will need to earn your degree in nursing. You will need to pass the examination that has been certified by the state in which you live. When you pass you will have achieved your bachelor degree.<br />The salary a registered nurse paid largely depends on the region in which they work; the industry or specialty and their level of experience. On average, an RN can earn approximately $66,000 as a starting salary. Registered nurses that choose to work in specialties such as trauma, radiology and critical care earn higher salaries. Nurse practitioners earn a salary in the range of $82,000 to over $100,000. Nurse anesthetists can earn $157,000 to well over $200,000 each year. A person who is thinking about becoming a RN can expect to earn a very good income, but there are other equally important benefits in this career.<br />If you have no clue what a pediatric nurse makes then you need to keep in mind that the pay range for this position will be anywhere from $35,235 to as high as $59,598; which is much better than most of the jobs on the market today. If you want to add this up to how much you will be making per hour; you can expect a payment scale of anywhere between $13.58 to $36.37 per hour. The great thing about this pay is you will have the option of working overtime which can easily increase your annual income.<br />The one thing which you have to keep in mind when searching at the salary opportunities is the fact that they'll vary depending on a number of different elements. One of the factors that will determine your pay is the place that you get hired or even the type of hospital setting that you begin working in. Not all of the nursing programs are better; in fact several of these jobs are filled by students who completed their education from certain schools.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ExbnVyc2luZy5jb20vdHJhdmVsLW51cnNlLXNhbGFyeS8_" target="_blank">read here</a>

Once you are qualified you will be able to work in hospitals, clinics, and family practices. Your speciality will be with working with children and their families and therefore you will need to be able to relate closely to people of all ages.<br />When a person decides to get into a nurse field they may wonder what the nursing salary may be. There are a few different factors that may influence the pay scale of a nurse. These factors could range from the location, business setting and experience. A nurse with varying education and training will also be up for promotions and top nursing jobs.<br />SS contribution - most don't consider this a benefit as 6.7% of their salary goes to social security but employers are required to contribute roughly the same amount for the employee's SS. The average RN's salary is $30.04 an hour and annual contribution will be worth $4186.37. Add to this your employer's contribution which should be about the same amount.<br />So what is an average salary? This will, obviously, will depend on several factors. Where you live being one of the major factors, as well as which specialty you choose to work in as a registered nurse, i.e. med-surg, emergency, ICU, etc. The starting hourly rate is better than most other starting pay rates for almost any other job. For example, I received my nursing license in Alabama. Typically the state of Alabama is one of the least paying areas of the country in regards to the registered nursing salary, it starts around $19 an hour. And whether a state is union or non union can play a big part on the pay rate too.<br />Nurses are known for achieving some great salaries that make them among the better paid professionals today especially in the United States. Whether the degree was achieved through formal school or through an online school, the benefits and the salary are the same. This is precisely the reason why a lot of students who will be graduating this year are seriously considering taking up Nursing.<br />As a registered nurse in Indiana, you can work in varied health care settings including hospitals, nursing homes, long term care facilities, ambulatory care centers, operating room, ICU, schools, physician&quot;s office, OPD, Emergency Rooms, health clinics and others.<br />Depending upon the state in which the nurse lives, other state-sanctioned requirements may apply as well. As a result of the increased levels of education required for this position, the median annual salary for this branch of nursing can reach as high as eighty thousand dollars. In some countries, the salary can range as high as six figures.<br />Something many people may not initially realize is that, aside from the extra money and better career advancement opportunities, you also are less likely to have to waste your time on endless meetings. Since there are not many higher-ups working the night shift, you will probably not have many meetings at all, and if you do, they will be focused and short.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ExbnVyc2luZy5jb20vdHJhdmVsLW51cnNlLXNhbGFyeS8_" target="_blank">click now</a>

		<document id="f5bc3572fbadb6a418ab9a0bd7df899f" url=""><![CDATA[Traveling Nurse Salary - Careers<br/><br/>If this sounds like the career you are looking for, there is plenty of information available on how to get started.<br />Nursing is normally seen as a vocation, with much of the reward coming from looking after people, and contributing to the society, but nursing is still a job, and you will get a nurse salary as part of your occupation. The Bureau of Labour Statistics keeps information on how much money each and every nurse gets in their wages, and could help to reveal that, while most people are yet finding it extremely difficult to earn a good wage in formerly vital jobs such as accountant or financial advisor, the average nursing salary has improved year on year.<br />The salary that the regular Licensed Practical Nurse receives in the United States is US$35000. This figure though can be somewhat inconclusive. Upon examining the facts in detail it gets quickly apparent that the span of licensed practical nurses wage varies rather largely due to the location of the job. In Puerto Rico, as a Licensed Practical Nurse you can get a little in excess of $16,000, in contrast in a quantity of east coast cities you might reasonably expect an LPN pay more than $45000 each year. Note this would not be only for the highest paid Licensed Practical Nurse employment but the average earnings.<br />Cost of living is measured by the ACCRA Cost of Living Index which accounts for housing, utilities, transportation, groceries, health care, and miscellaneous consumer products. An ACCRA value above 100 represents a cost of living higher than the national average while a value below 100 indicates a cost of living lower than the national average. The highest ACCRA values are Hawaii (163), Alaska (133.93), California (131.46), Connecticut (128.8) and New York (128.02). The lowest ACCRA values are Tennessee (89.05), Kentucky (89.18), Oklahoma (89.48), Arkansas (90.18) and Texas (91.26).<br />Many great RN jobs exist around the nation, but many experts agree the best cities to be a nurse are San Francisco, New York and Boston. Although the cost of living is much higher in these cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas compared to some other areas, the higher wages and wide range of available jobs in nursing more than make up for it. Here are some details about these cities and why nurses flock to them.<br />The state in which LPNs by and large collect the best salary is Massachusetts. It is the highest paid LPN state in US with a median LPN wage of USD 48,180 per annum, closely followed by District of Columbia with average annual wages of US$45,450. Third in line is Rhode Island where average salary for an LPN is US$43460, with fourth place going to Delaware at USD 41,460 each year. Next is New Jersey with the average Licensed Practical Nurse wage here being USD 41,240 with average LPN income for Maryland also coming in greater than the $40,000 barrier. The origin of all these salaries is a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br />On an average a registered and qualified nurse anesthetist can earn around $1, 30,000. Very few people are aware of this silent profession, and it is time to educate people about such specialized courses and the career growth prospects involved with them.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ExbnVyc2luZy5jb20vdHJhdmVsLW51cnNlLXNhbGFyeS8_" target="_blank">travel nurse practitioner salary</a>

Those providing home healthcare services make around $20.33 an hour and $42,300 a year.

Other factors influencing salary includes, advanced education in the specialty track, few years practical work experience, job location and job position.<br />This is a legitimate question for anyone wanting to pursue a career in nursing. I have always wanted to be a nurse, simply because I really enjoy taking care of people. However, I was curious to find out how much money I might earn by working as an RN. After I enrolled in nursing school, I was always asking my clinical teachers how much I could expect. The answer surprised me. So how much can an RN expect to make?<br />The licensed practical nurse (LPN) wage varies based on a lot of different factors. Some of the most important determinants of salary include experience and qualifications, the location where the LPN works, and the type of institution.<br />The wages of LPNs working in different healthcare facilities vary, but do not have significant differences. Still, this information can be valuable to you when you are performing a job search. According to official statistics the remuneration of licensed practical nurses working in the offices of physicians is the lowest on average. Their mean hourly wage is $17.68 and they make $36,770 a year. Those LPNs employed in general medical and surgical hospitals have a mean hourly wage of $19.22 and a mean annual salary of $39,980.<br />By completing advance education for Masters, Post Masters, certification and doctoral, you can get easy employments in the higher level nursing position with lucrative salary.<br />Though you will not be able to expect to be earning the highest sums in the beginning, you must be aware that there are certain cut-off points which could elevate you into the subsequent pay band if you have experience, or are better qualified. In reality, most nurses employed by hospitals, where education is regarded to be important, earned more than those at general physician's surgeries.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2ExbnVyc2luZy5jb20vdHJhdmVsLW51cnNlLXNhbGFyeS8_" target="_blank">travel nurse salary range</a>

They also advise parents on the correct methods to care for their newborn baby. And with a master's degree, these professionals can even become a neonatal nurse practitioner, providing more acute medical care when doctors are absent.<br />When you already got a certification from the national board and a license from the local state where you want to be a nurse practitioner, you can be stationed in any of the duties of a nurse depending on your hospital you are working with and your capabilities at the same time. Below are some of the responsibilities that a registered nurse can take.<br />Firstly, the level of education of an NP has an impact on the salary offered. Normally, in order to be able to practice as an NP, her or she is required to have a master's degree prior to sitting for a licensing examination to acquire the license.<br />A nursing practitioner job varies, but sometimes it depends on the area of study you focus in.  Some nurses specialize and become a family practitioner, while others become an adult practitioner.<br />A career, on the other hand, is something upon which we planned. It is a profession for which we trained, often by going to school to learn not only haw to do it, but why it is done. We love to work on our careers because they are chosen by us and after much thought. It is a job that we want to do for the rest of our lives. Careers are food for the soul. More often than not, our careers are something that we thought about as a child and never had any doubts that we would be great at it for life. Careers can offer something that no job could ever hope to offer, like...<br />Nurse practitioners manage the medical condition of the individual not only through medication but also through an emotional approach that takes into consideration the societal and other pressures faced by the individual. The result is a wholesome approach that educates the patient and the family about the condition and enables them to conquer the condition through more than medication, by adopting a healthier lifestyle as well. The benefits are long lasting for the patient and deeply satisfying for the nurse practitioner.
