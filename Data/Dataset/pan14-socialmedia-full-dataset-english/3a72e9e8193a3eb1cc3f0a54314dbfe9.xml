Under no circumstances put it in the blue aspect or you could trigger the brakes to lock up. Use only corporation supplied brake line anti-freeze as there are many products out there that will cause hurt to the inner brake process.<br /><br />8. Be sure glad-hands hook up 'tight'. If they go on 'loose' they will arrive off in a tight turn and will trigger unwanted cycling of the air compressor. Make sure you have a pleasant and snug match.<br /><br />These couple of suggestions can make the big difference in between go or no go scenario, producing that delivery dedication, or completing a operate vs. a breakdown. Breakdowns throughout inclement weather are incredibly unsafe.
