<br />what do I have to lose right? 
<br /><br />Hope it works! 
<br /><br />Supposedly The Phone Will Ring 
<br />Right After You Do This. 
<br /><br />Just read the little stories and 
<br />think of a wish as you scroll all 
<br />the way to the bottom. There is 
<br />a message there - then make your 
<br />wish. 
<br /><br />No attachment on this one. 
<br /><br />Stories 
<br /><br />I'm 13 years old, and I wished 
<br />that my dad would come home from 
<br />the army, because he'd been having 
<br />problems with his heart and right 
<br />leg. It was 2:53 p.m . When I made 
<br />my wish. At 3:07 p.m. (14 minutes 
<br />later), the doorbell rang, and 
<br />there my Dad was, luggage and all!! 
<br /><br />I'm Katie and I'm 20 and I've been 
<br />having trouble in my job and on the 
<br />verge of quitting. I made a simple 
<br />wish that my boss would get a new 
<br />job. That was at 1:35 and at 2:55 
<br />there was an announcement that he 
<br />was promoted and was leaving for 
<br />another city. Believe me...this 
<br />really works!!! 
<br /><br />My name is Ann and I am 45 years 
<br />of age. I had always been single 
<br />and had been hoping to get into a 
<br />nice, loving relationship for many 
<br />years. While kind of daydreaming 
<br />(and right after receiving this email) 
<br />I wished that a quality person would 
<br />finally come into my life. That was at 
<br />9:10 AM on a Tuesday. At 9:55 AM 
<br />a FedEx delivery man came into my 
<br />office.He was cute, polite and 
<br />could not stop smiling at me. He 
<br />started coming back almost everyday 
<br />(even without packages) and asked me 
<br />out a week later. We married 6 
<br />months later and now have been 
<br />happily married for 2 years. 
<br /><br />What a great email it was!! 
<br /><br />Just scroll down to the end, but 
<br />while you do, think of a wish. 
<br />Make your wish when you have completed 
<br />scrolling. Whatever age you are, is the 
<br />number of minutes it will take for your 
<br />wish to come true. ex.you are 25 years 
<br />old, it will take 25 minutes for your wish 
<br />to come true). 
<br /><br />However, if you don't send this to 
<br />people in 5 minutes, you will have bad 
<br />luck for years!! 
<br /><br />Go for it!!! 
<br /><br />SCROLL DOWN!!!!

Its time to change that girls and guys are worrying themselves over nuthing. The media controls the way we think. <strong>Weight, Looks, Personality, Cheating, Personal groups (Emo's, Slags and Slutts, and the geeks) e.t.c</strong> 
<br /><br />The media is making us all self conscious wen shuldnt we shuld all b happy the way we r. Fat or Thin. Pretty or Ugly. Cuz no matter wot everyone is pretty in our own ways. U shuldnt have to change who u r, just cuz the media says. Girls getting boob jobs just to look like <strong>Jordan or Caprice or Jodie marsh</strong>. 
<br /><br />Men getting worried if they r good looking to get a girl. there is a girl and guy out there for everyone. u just dnt realise it yet u have to kiss a few frogs to get to the one. I dnt see y everyone is so worried.
<br /><br />Ppl on this site have ago at girls who show their body off but at the end of the day they do that cuz they feel comfortable with themselves. You shuld nt judge them cuz they show their bodys off, you neva no they culd b reali nice girls at heart. 
<br /><br />Ppl judging guys and girls for cheating but yet havent u notice that almost every show we watch there is cheating goin on every, celebrity relationships wiv cheatin in n they r ment to b our roll models. Thats y ppl cheat cuz they think its ok for them to do it.
<br /><br />Everyone u dnt need the media u shuld just be happy the way u r. no matter wot u look like, no matter hw much u way, no matter hw much ur body u show off u all shuld just b proud of urselfs, n nt let anyone tell u diff, as long as ur happy with u being u, if u look deep down we r all pretty n beautiful, so y change that for sumthing that culd kill us?.
