How nice is it when you know where your sports bra is without digging through piles of lace! Why Organize? Organizing make it easy for Google and yahoo to find you. It's the job of your chosen SEO consultant to keep up to date and also to sort the wheat from the chaff with regard to the information they deal with.<br /><br />3. Be wary of automation<br /><br />I know we're dealing with computers, so it's tempting to think that they should lend themselves to automation and time saving. Actually, as SEO progresses, the reverse seems to be true. Automation can provide a quick solution but most of it can be spotted a mile off by Google's highly qualified engineers. They spend an inordinate amount of time making sure that their search results are as pure as the driven snow. They don't always succeed in this quest but they do manage to spot spammy techniques on a very regular basis and automation inevitably leaves footprints that would make sasquatch proud. Google's programmers look after billions (or more likely, trillions) of web pages. So they can't go in by hand and change individual search results. Which means that automated techniques often appear to slip through the radar for months or even years. But when the engineers catch up, your site bites the digital dust. So make sure that your SEO consultant only uses techniques that have stood the test of time, which almost always means they're not automated.<br /><br />4. Don't buy links<br /><br />Well, that's not totally true. If the links are flagged as being bought and are designed to get visitors directly to your site from the link, that's probably OK. But if your SEO consultant proposes that you buy links with the express idea of fooling Google into thinking those links are natural, that's a big red flag. Google hates paid-for links because they corrupt the process of getting the best possible search results for their users. When it finds them - and they normally leave a footprint - then it takes steps to negate them and will likely penalise your site in the search results at the same time.<br /><br />Human beings always want things to be easy and fast. This is the reason why we always fall for promises that automation gives, especially in work and business. In the world of Internet marketing, there exists automated SEO services and many marketers are falling for it. Real experts on SEO warn against the use of these services though. If you are someone who is thinking of using automated SEO services, then you need to know the reasons why you need to avoid them like the plague.<br /><br />They can hurt your site ranking<br /><br />Probably the best reason to avoid automated services is because they can hurt your site ranking. This is because in these services, only a single title and description for the site is used and then the information is submitted to hundreds or even thousands of web directories. This could sound the alarm against your site and search engines such as Google can penalize it. You don't want to be known as a spam producer right? So stop using those automated services.<br /><br />Directories change their rules all the time<br /><br />Web directories change their rules all the time. They do this because search engines like Google also change their rules all the time and also because of tough competition. If you will use an automated service, then there is a good chance that you will bypass or violate these rules. It is actually better if you will just stick to methods that will cost you more but won't endanger your site.<br /><br />If you have money to spare then instead of spending it on an automated service, just hire a manual submitter that can help you with your SEO needs.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5qdWtlYm94YWxpdmUuY29tL2Jsb2cucGhwP2Jsb2dfaWQ9MTEyNTMzOTM_" target="_blank">What Can You Expect From the Best SEO Software?</a>

How Do You Get Backlinks<br/><br/>A general wrong conception in the internet marketing industry is that the more links you could get, the better off you'll be, no matter what. More backlinks would increase your search engine ranking only if the links are quality (relevant) links. Conduct your research on where the links are originating and make sure that you've got something which will allow you to monitor the results yourself.<br /><br />The decision to obtain backlinks brings you a sigh of relief. It is obviously the best way to shoot your site up in search engine ranking. But don't forget, quality links are not affordable. You won't have to choose the most expensive ones necessarily although just be sure to prevent just acquiring the most links you could get for the lowest price. Again, research just what exactly you'll be gaining for your investment. Also avoid publicly owned link sites. These are more likely to be tracked and flagged by the search engines.<br /><br />You are better off paying a one-time (probably higher) fee for one link rather than constantly pay every month and risk losing your position when you do not pay one month for whatever reason or another. You are much better off acquiring permanent links. That is fine if you could just afford one at a time. Just add a link from time to time and your site would eventually increase in ranking until you have enough money to pay for more. The decision to obtain backlinks is a sound one if you get it done the right way, in line with the rules established by the search engines themselves.<br /><br />As backlinks helps create traffic to your site, so as video marketing can help you advertise your products. Together with the use of info product creation, you can make most of your marketing strategies and reach out to the greatest number of prospective customers possible by making use of video marketing with the assistance of info product creation. It can help you advertise your products, services, or even yourself with a well-made video.<br /><br />One of the crucial elements of any sound SEO campaign is backlinks. The right kind of backlinks can help propel a website from mediocrity to top rankings, turning an ordinary website into one that gets substantial traffic. When all of your SEO elements are in place, lots of traffic will lead to achieving your objectives, be it building a list or increased sales.<br /><br />Backlinks are easy to get once you know the techniques. The techniques are not difficult and once mastered the return on investment can be substantial.<br /><br />There are many places to look for backlinks and many websites are very accommodating to backlink seekers. The trouble is, every easy backlink comes with potential downsides. Lets look at a few:<br /><br /><strong>Free Backlink Services</strong>. Many of these services are springing up on the internet and they are becoming popular. You sign up, enter your keywords and url and your links are created. Typically you need to return to the site once a day to generate another set of links, and there is usually an upsell component.<br /><br />Here are the problems with these services:<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;They want you to return daily because this is their way of getting traffic so they are in effect using you for their own objectives.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;You have no control over where the links end up being placed or in what context. The search engines are getting very savvy at identifying and devaluing these types of links.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Forum Profiles</strong>. This is very straightforward. Become a forum member, create your profile, and place your link in the profile. You can even purchase lists of forums for as little as $5.<br /><br />The problem with this technique is unless you are planning on participating in the forum you are actually just creating a bogus profile that thousands of other people are also doing, so webmasters end up wasting their time scrutinizing these new profiles and end up deleting them as they contribute nothing to their community. What most people love about link directories is there are thousands out there and they are very easy to submit your URL to.

A bit like this article is doing really.<br /><br />The problem is that all this takes time.<br /><br />Which means that some less than scrupulous SEO companies try to shortcut things by introducing new levels of automation into the SEO process.<br /><br />In and of itself, automation is neither right nor wrong.<br /><br />It's what we do with that automation that can lead us into trouble.<br /><br />Done correctly, automation helps. For instance, I'm much happier writing this on a word processor than a typewriter or with pen and ink.<br /><br />Done incorrectly, automation hinders. Which is where unnatural SEO comes in. It takes a perfectly natural and normal process and takes it up a gear or two, speeding everything up to near warp speeds that would impress Scotty on Star Trek.<br /><br />In doing so, something gets sacrificed and it's usually a mixture of quality and targeting. Lower quality (often by a long way) and sloppier targeting.<br /><br />Sticking to natural search engine optimisation helps keep you away from the treachorous world of too much automation and keeps you on the good side of Google who are getting better and better at spotting and taking out the internet trash.<br /><br />You may think that using a cheap SEO service lowers the quality of the backlinks and Google rankings you may achieve, but the fact is that it could be the best advertising dollar you have ever spent!<br /><br />What Makes an Search Engine Optimization Service?<br /><br />There are a variety of factors that make an SEO service, so what you need to ask yourself is, &quot;How can I tell the difference between a good and a bad service?&quot; In the end, the only true measure is the quality of backlinks rather than the number a service can produce.<br /><br />You can go to a website like Fiverr and get thousands of links for just $5, but these are not the same as going to a reputable Search Engine Optimization company and using their services. In these situations, the real difference comes down to the way in which they obtain your links.<br /><br />A Cheap SEO Service Can Be Real or Automated<br /><br />These days automated software bots can obtain thousands of backlinks for your site while you sleep. Much of this is actually comment spam, where your website is left with inane comments on blogs and forums in the hope that you can get a backlink. Almost always these result in low quality, quickly removed backlinks and this strategy can hinder your search for high Google rankings rather than help it!<br /><br />But don't think all Cheap SEO Services are the same! For a small outlay you can get great quality links placed manually on your behalf by a real person. They may use some automation, but for the most part it has a human touch, leading to more authentic, more powerful backlinks which will last a lot longer and truly increase your rank on Google.<br /><br />So think before you leap in you Search Engine Optimization efforts. Not all Services are the same cheap or otherwise, and some can even harm what you are trying to do with your website. The automated ones can alert Google to the fact that you are using a bot rather than a human, and the search engines can slap you for this!<br /><br />If you would like to learn more about how to distinguish a good from a poor cheap SEO service then ask a lot of questions, and check out our informative site!

In fact, Google is in love with very unique content and you will be rewarded for having excellent content. Let's face it the search engine Google is content driven, so it makes perfect sense that they would give out extra brownie points for having unique content.<br /><br />&lt;u&gt;Here are some tips to help you get backlinks:&lt;/u&gt;<br /><br />Contact different webmaster's in your niche asking to contribute to their website. For instance, I would go through their contact page with a catchy subject like, &quot;free content for your site.&quot; Use the name of their site, don't say y&quot;our site&quot;! Remember it has to be personal; people get spam email everyday. Prior to doing that you will need to send them a personal message, and be as direct as you can; otherwise use their name at the start and state that you are willing to contribute to their website.<br /><br />Once you have gotten a response make sure you right a very unique article for them and provide a link to your website at the end of the article. I usually leave my links out of the body unless it is relative to what I am writing about. This is really my favorite method I use to get a backlink from authority sites.<br /><br />Furthermore, once they are happy with your work you can network with people, and build backlinks to internal pages on your site. This helps them by giving them free quality content, and also helps you buy getting great authoritative backlinks. Its a win, win!<br /><br />One more word of advice, ask for references and keep a excel spreadsheet of backlinks you have acquired. These references can lead you to huge websites with lots of link juice.<br /><br />When one is a writer, it is very important for him or her to have his or her articles read or websites visited. A backlink is a link that allows a visitor to click and be driven to one's site or page. The following are some simple tips on how to get backlinks to one's articles or pages.<br /><br />If one writes on a variety of sites, he or she can use a backlink to drive traffic to his or her own blog or page. This is a simple method for obtaining links, and one can control where he or she puts the backlink. Especially if one has informative articles, this is a great way to share one's wealth of information.<br /><br />Sometimes, if one uses a backlink to someone else's page, that writer may return the favor. This is a great way to build connections in this field. The more connections one has, the greater the chance of increasing his or her readership.<br /><br />There are some software programs that not only teach one how to create a backlink, but that also show one how to locate prospective areas of other backlinks. Stress free success waits not for those who outsource individual components of the process of generating backlinks and then tries to project manage them all to work together, but for those who outsource the entire process to a trusted and successful backlinks service provider.

Instead, it's the &quot;secret sauce&quot; that they use to maintain their edge in this highly lucrative market. So if any SEO firm claims they can guarantee where you will appear in the search results, don't use them.<br /><br />2. Pay peanuts, get monkeys<br /><br />If you're thinking of paying your SEO consultant a pittance then you can't expect them to produce Rolls Royce results. There isn't a complete correlation between the amount you pay and the results you get but there is certainly a reasonable degree. It just isn't possible to keep up with the search engine industry without spending a lot of time and money to keep up to date. Things change at lightning speed. Google can and does tweak their search algorithm. It is actually better if you will just stick to methods that will cost you more but won't endanger your site.<br /><br />If you have money to spare then instead of spending it on an automated service, just hire a manual submitter that can help you with your SEO needs.

		<document id="1c6ce220ca92bbf6641c6aae6910fc66" url=""><![CDATA[Places To Get Backlinks To Your Website<br/><br/>My advice to you is to just make sure that you spend the time to read the blog post you are submitting so that when it does get published on another site it will look right.<br /><br />Forums - If you are building a website then I bet you have been to a webmaster forum before, right? The nice thing about forums is they give you a signature link for every post you have. For instance if you write 10 posts a day you will have over 300 posts/links to your website by the end of the month. The nice part about this is you don't have to write very much and you still can get a link. Always remember that forums don't count towards a lot of link power and that is why you should still use another link method on top of that one.<br /><br />Link directories - This is not a new method, it is rather old but it still works good. The more tempting you can make that link appear the higher traffic you will also receive through it.<br /><br />To create backlinks using forum comments you should follow the same guidelines as for blog comments. Provide value and the forum community will flock to you for more answers and the number of clicks through your backlink will also increase.<br /><br />How to get backlinks with articles. Write high quality, relevant articles and post them on a high-ranking article directory. This will create backlinks to your landing page and can even bring in significant amounts of traffic. Ensure that your article has great information and use keywords for your backlink anchor text. Also make your links increasingly tempting. Inspire curiosity and you will have traffic coming through these backlinks consistently.<br /><br />You may now know how to get backlinks, but this process takes a long time to complete. In fact, creating sufficient backlinks to boost your page ranks significantly can take weeks to do manually. You could improve your efficiency by spending less time creating low quality backlinks and by focusing on creating only the best quality backlinks.<br /><br />Several website owners are aware of the significance of getting backlinks to their sites. Many people try the tiresome job of obtaining backlinks independently that takes time and patience. Before, it appears that only large businesses can shell out the funds needed to actually purchase backlinks. So they were the ones who ended up number one in the search engine rankings. But things have changed and there are a lot of services available today to the small business owner. While these kinds of services aren't cheap (especially when they're reputable), they can be highly worthwhile. In figuring out whether you need to acquire your backlinks or continue to do the backlink creation yourself, you should examine how necessary your time is to you as well as just how much you could spend to be able to free up some of that time. Should you choose to acquire backlinks, make sure that you follow a few easy guidelines.<br /><br />Keep in mind, not every backlinks are the quality that you require. A general wrong conception in the internet marketing industry is that the more links you could get, the better off you'll be, no matter what. More backlinks would increase your search engine ranking only if the links are quality (relevant) links. Conduct your research on where the links are originating and make sure that you've got something which will allow you to monitor the results yourself.<br /><br />The decision to obtain backlinks brings you a sigh of relief. It is obviously the best way to shoot your site up in search engine ranking. But don't forget, quality links are not affordable. You won't have to choose the most expensive ones necessarily although just be sure to prevent just acquiring the most links you could get for the lowest price. Again, research just what exactly you'll be gaining for your investment. Also avoid publicly owned link sites. These are more likely to be tracked and flagged by the search engines.<br /><br />You are better off paying a one-time (probably higher) fee for one link rather than constantly pay every month and risk losing your position when you do not pay one month for whatever reason or another. You are much better off acquiring permanent links. That is fine if you could just afford one at a time. Just add a link from time to time and your site would eventually increase in ranking until you have enough money to pay for more. It can help you advertise your products, services, or even yourself with a well-made video.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RlcnJlbGxjcm93bDExLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83NjUwNTY0MzIvaG93LXRvLWdldC1iYWNrbGlua3Mv" target="_blank">How To Get Backlinks</a>

For example, &quot;john@green widgets&quot;. Enter your website in the website field. Then add a comment.<br /><br />There are a couple of problems with this method.<br />&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Unless you are contributing to the conversation in a meaningful way your comments are not likely to get approved.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;If your comments are automatically approved, everyone's comments are automatically approved and this may create a situation where thousands of links can end up on the same page, making the search engines suspicious and likely de-indexing the page, in effect wasting your time.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Article Writing.</strong> This is a great way to create backlinks to your site.

Maybe it is not on the 1st page of your Google search, or you have to scroll to page 10 to find it? Or worse yet, you can't find it at all?

So what can be natural about anything to do with them?<br /><br />Well, natural in this context is being used in a very loose sense.<br /><br />Essentially it's saying that the SEO work that you or your chosen supplier carry out should be as natural as possible. In an ideal world, this means that people would find your masterpiece online and decide that it was so good that they simply had to share it. Maybe by posting it on Facebook, Tweeting about it, grabbing a classy photo and re-publishing it on Pinterest or any one of hundreds of other methods.<br /><br />Of course, this gives the chicken and egg scenario.<br /><br />No-one is going to link back to your content if they don't find it in the first place.<br /><br />And if you don't make front page news on one of the handful of popular sites on the web then the chances of that are slim to zero.<br /><br />So you have to prime the pump and get backlinks pointing to your website so that Google knows you exist, puts you in the search results and - hey presto! - people find your site.<br /><br />It's that process that's called natural search engine optimisation.<br /><br />A good SEO company will create a campaign for you that closely recreates the &quot;natural&quot; course of events.<br /><br />They'll maybe bookmark your site on one or two of the more popular sites like Digg.<br /><br />They may go so far as to create a video relating to your site and include a link back in the description below it.<br /><br />With luck this natural SEO will also include creating more content that will help people firstly and - as almost a side effect - prompt them to find out more about you by clicking a link. A bit like this article is doing really.<br /><br />The problem is that all this takes time.<br /><br />Which means that some less than scrupulous SEO companies try to shortcut things by introducing new levels of automation into the SEO process.<br /><br />In and of itself, automation is neither right nor wrong.<br /><br />It's what we do with that automation that can lead us into trouble.<br /><br />Done correctly, automation helps. For instance, I'm much happier writing this on a word processor than a typewriter or with pen and ink.<br /><br />Done incorrectly, automation hinders. Which is where unnatural SEO comes in. It takes a perfectly natural and normal process and takes it up a gear or two, speeding everything up to near warp speeds that would impress Scotty on Star Trek.<br /><br />In doing so, something gets sacrificed and it's usually a mixture of quality and targeting. Lower quality (often by a long way) and sloppier targeting.<br /><br />Sticking to natural search engine optimisation helps keep you away from the treachorous world of too much automation and keeps you on the good side of Google who are getting better and better at spotting and taking out the internet trash.<br /><br />Human beings always want things to be easy and fast. This is the reason why we always fall for promises that automation gives, especially in work and business. In the world of Internet marketing, there exists automated SEO services and many marketers are falling for it. Real experts on SEO warn against the use of these services though. If you are someone who is thinking of using automated SEO services, then you need to know the reasons why you need to avoid them like the plague.<br /><br />They can hurt your site ranking<br /><br />Probably the best reason to avoid automated services is because they can hurt your site ranking. This is because in these services, only a single title and description for the site is used and then the information is submitted to hundreds or even thousands of web directories.

It's generally thought that Google takes notice of over 200 different signs when it decides where to place a site in the search results. If you are going to spend money on search engine optimisation then you need to make sure that your SEO consultant can deliver what you're expecting.<br /><br />1. No guarantees<br /><br />This may sound odd but if an SEO consultant says they can guarantee your place in the search results, run a mile. They can't do this and they shouldn't promise it. Google may be a public company but that doesn't mean that the formula to produce the search results is public knowledge. Instead, it's the &quot;secret sauce&quot; that they use to maintain their edge in this highly lucrative market. So if any SEO firm claims they can guarantee where you will appear in the search results, don't use them.<br /><br />2. Pay peanuts, get monkeys<br /><br />If you're thinking of paying your SEO consultant a pittance then you can't expect them to produce Rolls Royce results. There isn't a complete correlation between the amount you pay and the results you get but there is certainly a reasonable degree. It just isn't possible to keep up with the search engine industry without spending a lot of time and money to keep up to date. Things change at lightning speed. Google can and does tweak their search algorithm. Small changes happen daily, larger changes happen more often but - like earthquakes - can't be predicted entirely. It's the job of your chosen SEO consultant to keep up to date and also to sort the wheat from the chaff with regard to the information they deal with.<br /><br />3. Be wary of automation<br /><br />I know we're dealing with computers, so it's tempting to think that they should lend themselves to automation and time saving. Actually, as SEO progresses, the reverse seems to be true. Automation can provide a quick solution but most of it can be spotted a mile off by Google's highly qualified engineers. They spend an inordinate amount of time making sure that their search results are as pure as the driven snow. They don't always succeed in this quest but they do manage to spot spammy techniques on a very regular basis and automation inevitably leaves footprints that would make sasquatch proud. Google's programmers look after billions (or more likely, trillions) of web pages. So they can't go in by hand and change individual search results. Which means that automated techniques often appear to slip through the radar for months or even years. But when the engineers catch up, your site bites the digital dust. It is actually better if you will just stick to methods that will cost you more but won't endanger your site.<br /><br />If you have money to spare then instead of spending it on an automated service, just hire a manual submitter that can help you with your SEO needs.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmlvdHRvYmFydDEwLnhhbmdhLmNvbS83NjUwNTY1OTYvc2VyZW5pdHktc2VvLWF1dG9tYXRpb24tdGhlLWJlc3QtaW4tbGluay1idWlsZGluZy0tYmFja2xpbmstZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi8_" target="_blank">What Is Natural Search Engine Optimisation?</a>

The logic goes something like this. If more websites link to your business and web pages, search engines assume that your site must be important and helpful. Therefore they decide that your website should be more visible to people searching on the web.<br /><br />Gradually, as you build high quality links through SEO link building services your rankings on various search engines keeps on improving. When you get to the first page or so, your business has the potential to improve dramatically, even exponentially. This is because, whenever users search for some information on search engines, they get what they want on the first page about 90% of the time. This is why you'd want your website to be on the first few result pages.<br /><br /><strong>What do SEO service providers do?</strong><br /><br />SEO link building services employ a variety of methods to increase links to your website. One of the most common and effective ways is to create blog posts that are related to your business niche. Blog posts contain interesting information that users find really helpful. They also contain a link or two that direct readers to your website. If you content is liked, people will want to check out your site. If they visit your site, there are chances that they will do business with you.<br /><br />Therein lays the challenge for providers offering link building services. They will need to create content that people are attracted to. This is what differentiates the good services from ordinary ones. They create multiple articles, often hundreds of them, and then create linkbacks to web pages on your site. The better the content, the more people will read it. Moreover, they are likely to recommend it to their friends too.<br /><br />The SEO link building services will have expert content writers to create relevant blog posts for you. They can analyze your business and its specifics and then create expert articles. Building quality links can also be achieved by submitting posts linking your website to social bookmarking sites, where they have higher visibility. They also lead to better search engine rankings for your site.<br /><br />SEO can be white hat, which is legitimate, or black hat, which uses illegal methods to improve rankings. You should choose only those link building services that use legitimate techniques. Any service providers that promise to get your website to the top of the rankings in a couple of weeks will most probably use black hat methods. A good service provider will help you gradually improve your rankings. When done the right way, these rankings are stable and will be sustained for a longer period of time.<br /><br />Building links through forums work in a really simple way. Web forums are online communities that are mostly niche-based and therefore present a great opportunity for SEO's to attract target traffic from this source. Almost all web forums allow their members to post links in the signature section of each post. These links are relevant to either the theme of the topic, or the niche of the forum.<br /><br />Through these links, SEO's try to entice forum readers and members to check out the suggested page. For this strategy to work, it is important that the post must be interesting or you have a good following on the forum so people will be easily inclined to click on the link that you have referred. To do it more effectively, expert forum link building services employ writers that are good in talking to people and have a natural ability to engage audience on a variety of topics.<br /><br />Having good communication skills is a must for whoever is posting on your behalf. If you are good at interactions, you can do it yourself. But as effective forum postings can take up a lot of time, it is far smarter to let professionals handle it at affordable prices and you focus your efforts on your core business.<br /><br />Forum link building is a tested method of attracting not only increased amount of traffic, but relevant traffic too. Some basic digging around the internet, should lead you to the right SEO service providers.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RlcnJlbGxjcm93bDExMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">Serenity SEO Automation: The Best In Link Building &amp; Backlink Generation</a>

Getting backlinks can be very powerful and helpful to you so that you can get more traffic to your website.<br /><br />There is no doubt that commenting on other websites is an effective approach to getting backlinks massively which will<br /><br />=&gt; enhance your site's page rank<br /><br />=&gt; position your site for receiving traffic.<br /><br />It enhances a site's traffic in two ways:<br /><br />1. The initial traffic which results directly from getting backlinks placed on other websites.<br /><br />2. The increased traffic from enhanced page rank which results indirectly from getting backlinks in large volume through positioning your site's links on other websites.<br /><br />This propels the position of your site higher on the search engine results pages (SERP's), thereby raising traffic volume to your site.<br /><br />To achieve the above objectives, the webmaster goes about commenting on other webmasters' sites such as other personal/business blogs, online magazines and various forums.<br /><br />I am finding out these days that commenting on high pr forums and online magazines is turning out more worthwhile than commenting on high pr personal/business blogs.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />As a result of the undermentioned reasons:<br /><br />=&gt; Comment moderation:<br /><br />I discover that comment moderation on high pr personal/business blogs is stricter than on online magazines and is even almost non-existent or at best minimal on forums.<br /><br />This assures that the webmasters' efforts in preparing his comment is not wasted as on most high pr personal/business blogs where such comments are often rejected.<br /><br />The impact of this is often not apparent to the commenting webmasters as they practically cannot keep verifying that all the comments they make on high pr personal/business blogs are ultimately approved.<br /><br />=&gt; Voluminous Articles/Content to peruse before commenting:<br /><br />I have observed that quite often, the articles you find on blogs are more voluminous than those on online magazines, not to talk of the short questions on forums.<br /><br />This essentially results from the fact that most webmasters do not post their own original content but rather rely heavily on others writing articles for them. Such articles usually try to adhere to acceptable standard of between 400 - 1000 words.<br /><br />The proper personal/business blog should ordinarily comprise of the webmasters' views on a number of home business techniques and events, breaking news regarding his niche etc and not only conventional articles strictly.<br /><br />But because of the limitation of most webmasters to personally keep updating their blogs with such information, hence the heavy reliance on others to produce articles for them, virtually solely.<br /><br />You therefore discover that you waste a lot of time reading and digesting these articles to be able to make meaningful comment.<br /><br />Given that time is a limited resource especially to the internet marketer who has to contend with a lot of competing information sometimes resulting into information overload, he hardly can afford the luxury of wasting any second but must optimally utilize this scarce resource (time)<br /><br />=&gt; Do Follow Attribute:<br /><br />No doubt, the webmaster benefits more from commenting on &quot;do follow&quot; sites and you discover that most reputable high pr forums are &quot;do follow&quot; unlike most personal/business blogs which are preset to &quot;no follow&quot; and left as such in most cases.<br /><br />As online magazines are few unlike personal/business blogs, with the installation of an SEO tool, one can easily sieve out the &quot;do follow&quot; online magazines from the &quot;no follow&quot; ones.<br /><br />=&gt; &quot;Do Follow&quot; subsequently changing to &quot;No Follow&quot;:<br /><br />I quite often get to see that a lot of personal/business blogs start out as &quot;do follow&quot; in a bid to get traffic but as soon as they become stable and prosperous and can afford to jettison some of their customers, they turn over to &quot;no follow&quot;.<br /><br />The implication of this is that the efforts of webmasters in commenting become more or less wasted as the links they placed on such blog sites can no longer be followed by most bots (especially Google) thereby making it useless from an SEO point of view.<br /><br />This hardly happens with most forums, as you discover that they stay consistent. If you don't want to front the whole cost of the network there are some quality ones to join but this is for more advanced users as it can get expensive.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3RlcnJlbGxjcm93bDExMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTc5Mi5odG1s" target="_blank">How to Get Backlinks for Your Website</a>

When all of your SEO elements are in place, lots of traffic will lead to achieving your objectives, be it building a list or increased sales.<br /><br />Backlinks are easy to get once you know the techniques. The techniques are not difficult and once mastered the return on investment can be substantial.<br /><br />There are many places to look for backlinks and many websites are very accommodating to backlink seekers. The trouble is, every easy backlink comes with potential downsides. Lets look at a few:<br /><br /><strong>Free Backlink Services</strong>. Many of these services are springing up on the internet and they are becoming popular. You sign up, enter your keywords and url and your links are created. Typically you need to return to the site once a day to generate another set of links, and there is usually an upsell component.<br /><br />Here are the problems with these services:<br /><br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;They want you to return daily because this is their way of getting traffic so they are in effect using you for their own objectives.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;You have no control over where the links end up being placed or in what context. The search engines are getting very savvy at identifying and devaluing these types of links.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Forum Profiles</strong>. This is very straightforward. Become a forum member, create your profile, and place your link in the profile. You can even purchase lists of forums for as little as $5.<br /><br />The problem with this technique is unless you are planning on participating in the forum you are actually just creating a bogus profile that thousands of other people are also doing, so webmasters end up wasting their time scrutinizing these new profiles and end up deleting them as they contribute nothing to their community. You in effect become part of the problem.<br /><br /><strong>Blog Commenting</strong>. This is a very good approach and can yield good results for your website. In the name field you can place your keyword. For example, &quot;john@green widgets&quot;. Enter your website in the website field. Then add a comment.<br /><br />There are a couple of problems with this method.<br />&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Unless you are contributing to the conversation in a meaningful way your comments are not likely to get approved.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;If your comments are automatically approved, everyone's comments are automatically approved and this may create a situation where thousands of links can end up on the same page, making the search engines suspicious and likely de-indexing the page, in effect wasting your time.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Article Writing.</strong> This is a great way to create backlinks to your site. Within the text of the article you place your keyword and a link back to your site.<br /><br />You want to be careful about how you use your keywords though. Most article directories of any value will reject your article if it is too self-promotional. The only other real downside to this techniques is that, unless you are a prolific writer, articles take a lot of time to write, so the number of links you can create are limited.<br /><br />Many savvy webmasters outsource their backlink building to good backlink service providers who avoid the downsides and are able to offer not-so-easy to get backlinks that are of even greater value. Good providers with sound track records can be your easiest source of backlinks, especially if you measure the value of your time against the cost of outsourcing the work to professionals. And outsourcing need not be costly.<br /><br />What are backlinks? Why do you need them? How do you get them? Knowing the answers to these questions will help you get your website, blog or any online content ranked better in the search engines thus bringing you more traffic. And higher traffic is always a good thing. This article will answer the question of what are backlinks, describe their importance and how to get them.<br /><br />What are backlinks? Any link to a webpage, blog, article etc. What most people love about link directories is there are thousands out there and they are very easy to submit your URL to.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmlvdHRvYmFydDEwMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTQwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">What Is Natural Search Engine Optimisation?</a>

SEO is the basic approach or search engine marketing and only a few people understand SEO. SEO is defined as &quot;search engine optimization&quot;. Search engine optimization is simply a process of getting your website ranked amongst the top search engine results. Search engine optimization (SEO) is not a walk in the park, only those that understand the principles and the work involved will get the best results. You will need to understand the use of content and keywords. The keyword research automation tools will help you to get a head start in SEO.<br /><br />Before you think of owning a website today, you need to understand SEO. Search engine optimization is all about providing content. You need to write information about your products or rather about keywords that are related to your product or website. You need to make sure that you provide a lot of content in order to get ranked high amongst the search engine results. Try as much to write articles relevant to your niche or keywords and post them into the article directories with links towards your website. That way your website will become popular and you will soon be recommended by other websites and the more you become popular amongst the online community, the higher your ranking gets.<br /><br />Understanding the use of keywords will also be important when it comes to providing SEO content. You need to make sure that you are using keywords that drive more traffic towards your website. If you use keywords that are very much popular on the online community there are high chances that you will not be able to meet the SEO needs and you will always get a low ranking in these search engines. It's always the big timers and those that have been contributing information for a long-time that make it high amongst the top search engine ranks of the common keyword searches. If you want to get the best of keywords then you need to utilise the keyword research tools.<br /><br />The keyword research tools enable you to choose the keywords that have less competition. The research tools will carry out a search on the internet and determine the keywords that have high competition results and those with low competition. Once the research tool has done this for you, you will know the keywords to use.<br /><br />There are quite a number of keyword research tools that are available on the internet today. There are those that are free and those that are for sale. It is pretty obvious that the ones for sale will give you the best SEO deal.<br /><br />Buzzwords abound in the search engine world. Some of them are designed as shortcuts such as the abbreviation SEO for search engine optimisation but some of them seem designed to confuse such as natural search engine optimisation. After all, we're dealing with computers here and there's nothing particularly natural about them. Sure, they have some of their roots in the real world but they're not farmed and they don't grow on trees. So what can be natural about anything to do with them?<br /><br />Well, natural in this context is being used in a very loose sense.<br /><br />Essentially it's saying that the SEO work that you or your chosen supplier carry out should be as natural as possible. Lower quality (often by a long way) and sloppier targeting.<br /><br />Sticking to natural search engine optimisation helps keep you away from the treachorous world of too much automation and keeps you on the good side of Google who are getting better and better at spotting and taking out the internet trash.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmlvdHRvYmFydDEwMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTQwMi5odG1s" target="_blank">Keyword Research Automation Tools</a>

Backlinks. You NEED backlinks for your website. Everyone is looking to create them. However, just what exactly are some good ways to create backlinks? Which method of creating backlinks is the best? With this article, I will share my top 5 methods for obtaining backlinks. I have personally used these methods for years, and I highly recommend them.<br /><br />1. Blog commenting is a highly followed way to get more backlinks. SEO service providers make this possible by creating backlink comments on posts at other sites. This can have two effects. First off, it can help to increase your search engine rankings by increasing your backlink count. Second, the people visiting some of these other blogs can read the comments then follow the link back to your website.<br /><br />2. Article writing is also a very useful way to create backlinks. With most article directories, you are free to include your website link. Not only are you reaching users that just read your article and may be interested in your website, but you are also placing your link on a relevant page about your niche. This is very important to some when it comes to creating backlinks.<br /><br />3. Using social networking web sites is becoming a lot more common with webmasters today. These social networking sites likes Facebook, tweeter, etc, are used by millions and millions of people. There are always different communities that can be found and you can often find a community related to your web site. If you provide some useful content with some of your posts, people will often be more than happy to click your link to your website.<br /><br />4. Guest posting is another important to get backlinks. Good luck!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmlvdHRvYmFydDEwMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTg3MC5odG1s" target="_blank">What Is Natural Search Engine Optimisation?</a>

Don't buy links<br /><br />Well, that's not totally true. If the links are flagged as being bought and are designed to get visitors directly to your site from the link, that's probably OK. But if your SEO consultant proposes that you buy links with the express idea of fooling Google into thinking those links are natural, that's a big red flag. Google hates paid-for links because they corrupt the process of getting the best possible search results for their users. When it finds them - and they normally leave a footprint - then it takes steps to negate them and will likely penalise your site in the search results at the same time.<br /><br />Search engine optimization has become the basis of online marketing today; if you want to get enough traffic for your website then you need to understand the search engines. SEO is the basic approach or search engine marketing and only a few people understand SEO. SEO is defined as &quot;search engine optimization&quot;. Search engine optimization is simply a process of getting your website ranked amongst the top search engine results. Search engine optimization (SEO) is not a walk in the park, only those that understand the principles and the work involved will get the best results. You will need to understand the use of content and keywords. The keyword research automation tools will help you to get a head start in SEO.<br /><br />Before you think of owning a website today, you need to understand SEO. Search engine optimization is all about providing content. You need to write information about your products or rather about keywords that are related to your product or website. You need to make sure that you provide a lot of content in order to get ranked high amongst the search engine results. Try as much to write articles relevant to your niche or keywords and post them into the article directories with links towards your website. That way your website will become popular and you will soon be recommended by other websites and the more you become popular amongst the online community, the higher your ranking gets.<br /><br />Understanding the use of keywords will also be important when it comes to providing SEO content. You need to make sure that you are using keywords that drive more traffic towards your website. If you use keywords that are very much popular on the online community there are high chances that you will not be able to meet the SEO needs and you will always get a low ranking in these search engines. It's always the big timers and those that have been contributing information for a long-time that make it high amongst the top search engine ranks of the common keyword searches. If you want to get the best of keywords then you need to utilise the keyword research tools.<br /><br />The keyword research tools enable you to choose the keywords that have less competition. The research tools will carry out a search on the internet and determine the keywords that have high competition results and those with low competition. Once the research tool has done this for you, you will know the keywords to use.<br /><br />There are quite a number of keyword research tools that are available on the internet today. There are those that are free and those that are for sale. It is pretty obvious that the ones for sale will give you the best SEO deal.<br /><br />Buzzwords abound in the search engine world. Some of them are designed as shortcuts such as the abbreviation SEO for search engine optimisation but some of them seem designed to confuse such as natural search engine optimisation. After all, we're dealing with computers here and there's nothing particularly natural about them. Sure, they have some of their roots in the real world but they're not farmed and they don't grow on trees. The automated ones can alert Google to the fact that you are using a bot rather than a human, and the search engines can slap you for this!<br /><br />If you would like to learn more about how to distinguish a good from a poor cheap SEO service then ask a lot of questions, and check out our informative site!<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL21hcmlvdHRvYmFydDEwMi5pbnNhbmVqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMTY3OS5odG1s" target="_blank">How to Get Backlinks for Your Website</a>
