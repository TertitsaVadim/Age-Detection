<br />How did he not find the baggy, with his hand in my shoe? 
<br />Way too close for me, ah well at least they allowed me through. 
<br />Should be a good night in here, Ramo in the main room, 
<br />People keep pushing me though, no reception on the phone. 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />They said they'd be here, they said, they said in the corner, 
<br />And im thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />These look well speckly, bit green and blue, 
<br />Threes is well cheap though, so i'll take three if i need to. 
<br />Right im on the plan, i wish the bouncers would go away, 
<br />Borrow water off this man, here goes nothing OK, 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />argh Thats proper rank, that tastes like hairspray 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />I hate coming to the entrance, just to get bars on my phone, 
<br />You have no new messages, so why haven't they phoned? 
<br />Menu, write message, so where are you and Simone? 
<br />Send message, dans number, where've they gone? 
<br />And im thinkin'... 
<br />(the Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />Why's the message pending? where the fuck are ya? 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, there walkin' off into the night) 
<br />Hmm, brandy or beer? Waters a good idea, 
<br />Wish that bar lady'd appear; and come serve over here. 
<br />Where the fuck could they be? still not over in the corner, 
<br />This nights a tragedy, i keep thinking i saw her. 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />No thats not them, thats not them either... 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />I'm still not feeling anything, this has got to be a dud. 
<br />It's been ages since i necked it, and smoked six tabs to the nub. 
<br />Belly's not even tingling, i just feel a bit pissed.. 
<br />No-one looks like minglin', i cant see her or him.. 
<br />And im thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />I'm gonna do another i think. Yeah, one more, these are shit. 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />These toilets are a piss take, queue's bigger than the door. 
<br />Gotta get rid of this pill taste, what are they chattin so much for? 
<br />Glad i'm not a girl in this place, they'll be here til dawn. 
<br />Sure my belly's tingling a bit, summat's happening im sure. 
<br />And im thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />Maybe i shouldnt have done the second one, i feel all fidgety and warm... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />Whoa, everything in the room is spinning, i think i'm going to fall down, 
<br />My heart's beating too quick, i'm fucking tripping out. 
<br />I wonder whether they got in, turned away no doubt. 
<br />Who cares, this is a tune coming in, that one where hes just like.. 
<br />Im thinkin'... 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />My eyes are rolling back, i'm rubbing my thighs with my hand. 
<br />And i'm thinkin'... 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />Yeah yeah they cheer - can they see my hand in the air? 
<br />Need to wave 'em over here. Swear Simone's kissing Dan. 
<br />My head is twisted severe, body's rushing everywhere, 
<br />They could have texted me when they were near, but i'm fucked and i don't care. 
<br />(Lights are blinding my eyes) 
<br />What was i thinkin' about? Ah who cares, i'm maaaashed. 
<br />(People pushin' by, then walkin' off into the night) 
<br />Totally fucked, cant hardly fuckin' stand. 
<br />This is fuckin amazing; argh.
