That's because when she's not working, she's likely to be at home with her family or on service trips to farflung destinations with such groups as Heart for Africa or Water for People. The Turner family moved to Denver when Christine was a child. Her father, NFL kicker Jim Turner, was traded from the New York Jets to the Denver Broncos in 1971. He played with the Broncos through 1979. She studied journalism at Colorado State University and worked in advertising, public relations and marketing before starting her own business, Turner PR, in 1997. The company specializes in travel and tourism, outdoor and lifestyle consumer brands, and has offices in Denver and New York, employing 30 people. Turner, 42, met her husband Geoff Landry while skiing in Vail. They married in 2002 and have three children, Natalia, 7, Ryder, 5 and Tigist, 4.
<br />The globetrotting Turner loves Italy and Africa, but her favorite spot to spend her down time is in her 1972 Cherry Hills Village home. She and her husband bought and renovated the interior of their contemporary split level residence in 2004 and added a &quot;Moroccan&quot; patio. Last year, they put in a custom fire pit and collapsible glass wall. They also like packing up the kids for hikes and cycling excursions on the High Line Canal near the home.
<br />Question: What led you to decide to adopt a child when you already had kids that were ages 1 and 3?
<br />Answer: I had always wanted to adopt. Then I read &quot;It's Not Okay with Me,&quot; by Janine Maxwell, about children dying of the AIDS pandemic in Africa.
<br />Q: Did you always intend to adopt in Africa?
<br />A: Geoff and I had just returned from two weeks in Kenya, serving with Heart for Africa. I think there were 100 children in the orphanage that just needed a mom or dad. I've been drawn to the needs of developing countries and the imbalance of resources that exist in our world. Being poor in the U.S. is not equivalent to what it's like in other countries. And as a mother, I know you'd do anything for your children.
<br />Q: When did you get to meet your daughter?
<br />A: It was a blind adoption, so we didn't know anything until the day in 2007 when they called and said, 'Are you sitting down?' We had been approved for a female, age zero to 2, but didn't find out until July 2009 who she was. We met her on Sept. 25 and spent two weeks there. She attached to us right away, but when we met her, she was not walking; she was very malnourished. And she was just learning language. She spoke a little of her tribal language, and in the orphanage they spoke the national language, Amharic.
<br />Q: Tell me about her name.
<br />A: Tigist means &quot;patience&quot; in Amharic.
<br />Q: What was the transition like once you got back to Colorado?
<br />A: The most challenging part was my 3½- year-old not being the baby in the family anymore. And Tigist had some health problems. She had the same strain of malaria that her mother died from. She tested negative in Ethiopia and tested positive here. It's heartbreaking because you take seven pills, and you're cured. Seven pills that her mother couldn't get. And she had latent tuberculosis and giardiasis. The infectious diseases department at Children's Hospital was incredible.
<br />Q: Have you tried to instill your interest in nonprofit work to your employees?
<br />A: Yes, I really think we all can do more. But I don't believe I should push my interests onto others, so we have a program called Simply Give. Every year (employees) get three paid days to volunteer doing anything they want, and then they blog about it or write about it on our website. They do a lot locally at schools, for Habitat for Humanity, the Dumb Friends League, for leukemia or breast cancer.
<br />Q: How has your business weathered the recession?
<br />A: In 2008 when the market crashed, every agency went through a loss of clients and reshifting at the same time the world was changing how it communicated and how news was delivered.
<br />In the old days you trusted a few media sources: ABC, NBC, CBS, your local newspaper, national magazines and possibly your favorite fashion magazine if you were following trends. It's very different today. I might follow you because I have gained a trust with you.
<br />We had to build a digital communications team with the knowledge of how to speak directly to the consumer. I brought in people who were much smarter than me in social media. Had we not made that decision, we'd be irrelevant today.
<br />Q: What does that team do?
<br />A: They have to identify key influencers depending on the client's objective — it might be a blogger or a mountain climber who has an active following. The influencers might set trends in fashion or know where to travel and talk about how to travel with family or know where to go in their cities. The goal is to talk about that experience or that apparel or that gear in front of their 200,000 Twitter followers.
<br />Q: You travel a lot. What's always in your suitcase?
<br />A: Wrinkle-free clothes and my Truffle bags, which hold the essentials I transfer between handbags — wallet, keys, sunglasses. My iPad, my iPhone.
<br />Q: Shoes?
<br />A: Stuart Weitzman wedges, which I can walk in for 12 hours. And Pikolinos, which I literally wore in the fields of Africa. K-Swiss running shoes.
<br />Q: Do you work out?
<br />A: I love hiking in the mountains and on the High Line canal. I love skiing and yoga. It's a beautiful week if I can go twice a week to Tonya's power yoga class at Greenwood Athletic Club. It helps me stay balanced.
<br />Q: What is your present state of mind?
<br />A: Joy — and a struggle to find balance. A little of both.
<br />Q: What is your most marked characteristic?
<br />A: Being a multitasker. I'm continually thinking of what's going on in New York, what's going on with every client and at the same time scheduling three kids' lives and managing where they need to be, what homework is due today. I call it air-traffic control in your head. That's my life right now. The greatest challenge is to turn it off. And that usually doesn't happen unless I'm on an international flight with my husband traveling somewhere.
<br />Q: What do you enjoy most?
<br />A: Hanging out with Geoff and the kids and the dog on a Saturday.
<br />Q: What is your idea of happiness?
<br />A: Children laughing.
<br />Q: What is your favorite quality in a man?
<br />A: Loyalty.
<br />Q: In a woman?
<br />A: Friendship.
<br />Q: What do you most value in your friends?
<br />A: Honesty.
<br />Q: Who are your favorite writers?
<br />A: I switch from fiction to nonfiction a lot. I loved &quot;Half the Sky,&quot; by Nicholas Kristof. I've read &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; by Ayn Rand, several times, and Dave Eggers' book &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; was great for laughs. I read anything by Deepak Chopra, as he is a great teacher. I also couldn't put down &quot;Somewhere Inside,&quot; by Laura Ling, about being captured in North Korea.
<br />Q: Do you have any favorite heroines in fiction?
<br />A: Dagny Taggart from &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; and of course who doesn't love Elizabeth from &quot;Pride and Prejudice?&quot;
<br />Q: Favorite musicians?
<br />A: I like a lot of different types of music. I love U2; we went to their concert in Dublin. I just went to a concert by Michael Franti. He's doing such good work for the Boys &amp; Girls clubs. I love Adele.
<br />Q: Who are the heroes and heroines in your life?
<br />A: People on the front lines in developing countries working on issues like poverty or peace, helping in Haiti or Kenya.
<br />Q: What is your favorite food and drink?
<br />A: My husband is an amazing cook. He's better than a five-star restaurant. I love Thai and Italian food, white wine and margaritas.
<br />Q: What natural gift would you most like to possess?
<br />A: I would love a singing voice. And I don't have one. I can only imagine what it would be like to sing at a place like Red Rocks.
<br />Q: What do you most dislike?
<br />A: An unwillingness to step outside of our bubbles to understand what's really happening in the world. The perspective and awareness is a gift. It's true that once we know better, we do better. Everyone needs to find their one thing. And do something about it.
<br />Q: What fault in others do you most easily tolerate?
<br />A: Impatience.
<br />Q: What fault in yourself?
<br />A: I have so many! Probably impatience. I'm always thinking: &quot;Just do it!&quot;
<br />Q: How would you like to die?
<br />A: In my sleep, with my husband at the same time when we are 85.
<br />Q: What is your motto?
<br />A: I've always been drawn to the quote attributed to Mahatma Gandhi: &quot;Be the change that you wish to see in the world.&quot;

<br /><br />Obama authorities privately discussed as well as used ACTA (the actual Anti-Counterfeiting Industry Contract). This set up unhindered supranational worldwide industry guidelines. It's procedures trample upon nationwide sovereignty, privateness as well as individual freedoms.
<br /><br />Within Oct 2011, Obama lawlessly circumvented Our elected representatives. He or she authorized ACTA. He or she falsely stated it isn't the treaty. He or she usurped diktat expert. He or she stated he or she behaved through &quot;executive contract. inch He or she strong-armed additional countries to visit together.
<br /><br />TPP (the actual Trans-Pacific Relationship) is actually ACTA two. 0. The actual Digital Independence Basis (EFF) phone calls this &quot;a deceptive, multi-nation contract which threatens to increase limited rational home laws and regulations around the world. inch
<br /><br />10 countries discussed this privately in addition Asia without having official standing. These people consist of The united states, Sydney, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam, Brand new Zealand, Chile, Singapore, Brunei, North america, as well as South america.
<br /><br />They need this used silently from open public look at. Because 03 2010, several settling models had been kept. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reneeolstead.com%2Fblog%2Flucia%26quot%3B%26gt%3BLUCIA"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.reneeolstead.com/blog/lucia&quot;&gt;LUCIA</a>'S BLOG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.These people carry on. Additional countries will come on-board. South america may be the most recent.
<br /><br />From concern is actually saying yes upon unhindered industry within products, providers, guidelines associated with source, industry treatments, sanitary as well as phytosanitary steps, specialized obstacles, federal government procurement as well as competitors guidelines, as well as rational home (IP).
<br /><br />IP consists of copyrights, images, patents, as well as associated factors. One-sided pro-business structuring causes harm to regular well-liked privileges. On the line is really a free of charge as well as open up Web, it's worldwide national infrastructure, as well as globally development below degree actively playing area guidelines.
<br /><br />Energy agents would like deceptive procedures set up without any open public understanding of their own harmful damage. TPP is designed in order to edit worldwide IP enforcement guidelines. Additionally, it consists of several additional anti-populist requires.
<br /><br />Nationwide sovereignty reaches risk. Signatory nations will need to alter household laws and regulations, rules, along with other guidelines in order to conform.
<br /><br />Leaked out procedures subvert ALL OF US laws and regulations. Our elected representatives is actually helpless in order to impose all of them. Supranational TPP expert overrides nationwide sovereignty. Buyer privileges tend to be prioritized more than open public types.
<br /><br />Business titans currently guideline the planet. Picture providing them with much more energy. Picture getting not a way to prevent all of them. Picture the leader trashing individual freedoms with regard to their own self-interest.
<br /><br />Within 1995, Lori Wallach started Worldwide Industry View. It is a Open public Resident department. This screens harmful industry offers.
<br /><br />It's &quot;mission is actually to ensure with this period associated with globalization, a big part get the chance to savor financial protection, the thoroughly clean atmosphere, secure meals, medications as well as items, use of high quality inexpensive providers for example healthcare and also the physical exercise associated with democratic decision-making concerning the issues which impact their own life. inch
<br /><br />Operating carefully along with environment, work, along with other allied organizations, Wallach facilitates the general public curiosity about Our elected representatives, international parliaments, the actual legal courts, federal government companies, and also the press.
<br /><br />The Nationwide Diary user profile known as the woman's &quot;the industry debate's guerrilla soldier. a The actual Start with regard to Worldwide Economics states she is the actual &quot;madame Defarge associated with Seattle. inch
<br /><br />Upon 06 13, Open public Resident headlined &quot;Controversial Industry Pact Textual content Leaked out, Exhibits Ough. Utes. Industry Authorities Possess Decided to Conditions Which Weaken Obama Household Plan. inch
<br /><br />&quot;After 2 yrs associated with Closed-Door Discussions, Trans-Pacific Relationship Textual content Replicates Worrying Rose bush Industry Pact Conditions Which Obama Compared because Prospect, as well as Even worse. inch
<br /><br />ALL OF US authorities privately decided to questionable procedures. Based on Wallach:
<br /><br />&quot;The crazy things with this leaked out textual content may be the reason why Ough. Utes .&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mulberrybagsoutletclub.co.uk%2Fbayswater-c-6.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMulberry"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mulberrybagsoutletclub.co.uk/bayswater-c-6.html&quot;&gt;Mulberry</a> Bayswater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. industry authorities happen to be therefore very deceptive regarding these types of previous 2 yrs associated with TPP discussions. inch
<br /><br />&quot;Via closed-door discussions, Ough. Utes. authorities tend to be spinning swaths associated with Ough. Utes. regulation which have absolutely nothing related to industry as well as inside a proceed which will infuriate remaining as well as correct as well possess decided to publish the actual Ough. Utes. federal government towards the legal system associated with international tribunals that may purchase limitless obligations in our taxes bucks in order to international companies which don’t wish to adhere to exactly the same laws and regulations the household companies perform. inch
<br /><br />Crazy TPP Expense Section procedures:
<br /><br />(1) stop government, condition, as well as nearby government authorities through controlling international businesses working in the usa. They will possess higher privileges compared to ALL OF US companies.
<br /><br />(two) incentivize business The united states to get overseas as well as just offshore much more work in order to reduced salary nations.

<br /><br />(four) allow international companies need as well as obtain payment with regard to expenses sustained within complying around monetary or even environment rules which utilize similarly to any or all businesses internationally.
<br /><br />Countless ALL OF US business authorities get access to TPP procedures. They are counseling ALL OF US negotiators on which they need. Aside from leakages, the general public is actually completely close away.
<br /><br />ALL OF US Industry Consultant Ron Kirk guarded TPP secrecy in spite of getting absolutely no lower-leg in order to remain upon. Based on Wallach:
<br /><br />He or she &quot;effectively offers stated how the management should maintain TPP solution simply because or else this won’t have the ability to push this particular offer after dark open public as well as Our elected representatives. inch
<br /><br />&quot;The airing of the 1 TPP section, that significantly mementos international companies more than household companies and also the open public curiosity as well as reveals all of us in order to substantial monetary debts, implies that the entire write textual content should be launched instantly therefore it may be examined as well as discussed. inch
<br /><br />&quot;Absent which, these types of discussions should be finished right now. inch
<br /><br />Obama desires discussions finished through drop. Additional nations tend to be liberated to participate in later on. Info Open public Resident acquired exhibits exactly how TPP tramples upon person independence as well as nationwide sovereignty.
<br /><br />ALL OF US negotiators would like extrajudicial enforcement privileges. They need business traders liberated to complete exactly what these people make sure you without having regulating oversight.
<br /><br />Upon 06 fourteen, Open public Resident stated TPP &quot;could weaken Medicare insurance, Medicaid, inch as well as veterans' many benefits. Senior citizens, army households, as well as Numerous minimum advantaged is going to be injured the majority of.
<br /><br />How the entire concept. TPP prioritizes business pursuits in the cost associated with open public types. For instance, inexpensive medications is going to be dropped. Cost containment is going to be subverted. Leaked out text messaging uncover this.
<br /><br />Upon 06 eighteen, Open public Resident stated South america grew to become the actual 10th settling nation. The far east apparently is actually looking for admittance. Anticipate other people to follow along with.
<br /><br />Wallach once again anxious which TPP's &quot;model is actually essentially problematic: It’s difficult to assume that with this nation might assistance this when they understood it prohibited 'Buy American' procurements, restricted Web independence the los angeles SOPA (the actual questionable Cease On the internet Piracy Behave) or even produced the two-track judicial program privileging companies having a brand new solution in order to raid the taxes bucks .&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mulberrybagsoutletclub.co.uk%2Fsatchel-c-10.html%26quot%3B%26gt%3BMulberry"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mulberrybagsoutletclub.co.uk/satchel-c-10.html&quot;&gt;Mulberry</a> Satchel Bags Sale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. inch
<br /><br />&quot;Adding much more nations simply grows the actual possible risks associated with business episodes how the TPP presents in order to individuals right here and today additionally presents in order to Mexicans. inch
<br /><br />Congressional competitors is available. Sixty-nine people authored Obama following understanding which TPP bans &quot;Buy American&quot; procurement guidelines.
<br /><br />The whole Our elected representatives may suspend it's loath upon which concern. Regardless of whether it'll is actually an additional issue completely.
<br /><br />ALL OF US national politics tend to be as well damaged to repair. Big bucks regulates this. Exactly what business funders would like these people obtain.
<br /><br />Open public trend on it's own can alter points. Anticipate absolutely nothing otherwise to operate. It is about time individuals recognized the actual dollar halts together. There isn't any option.
<br /><br />It is their own option as well as load in order to keep or else. Ideally they will operate with regard to exactly what they ought to possess required sometime ago.

<br /><br />Two recent incidents may not make for a trend, but an incident in Lower Macungie Township was the second in recent times involving feces being used as the weapon of choice.
<br /><br />Harkening back a bit, the referenced old gag was to place feces in a bag, light the bag on fire and ring a doorbell. The startled owner, seeing the flame, would stomp on the bag and . . . well, you can figure out the rest if, in fact, you weren't already familiar with the gag.
<br /><br />Skipping ahead, and regardless of the motivation, Susan Harvey of 1453 Walnut Lane reported June 28 to state police at Fogelsville that someone had put feces in a plastic bag in her mailbox. She said the material was left between 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. She also reported that a derogatory message was written in chalk on her driveway. The incident was classified as disorderly conduct.
<br /><br />The other recent incident in the township involving feces occurred June 6 along Village Round E.  A bag of dog feces was placed on a vehicle.

		<document id="f87806b50bbe9d26c2f218ebfbc5fd03" url=""><![CDATA[Olympic bet: Australia to bag 15 golds<br/><br/>A team of economists at Goldman Sachs predicts Australia will rank fifth in the world at the London Olympics, winning 15 gold medals and 46 in total.
<br />In a report, The Olympics and Economics 2012, the investment bank draws on past statistical data to study the economic impact of Olympic Games on host countries, including the impact on GDP, tourism and the number of medals won. It also looks at the overall return.
<br />The report found that host nations win 54 per cent more medals than they otherwise might, particularly in cycling, sailing and rowing.
<br />Two clear patterns emerged from the analysis - some of it in the not-too-surprising basket.
<br />Advertisement  
<br />First, countries with superior growth environments and higher incomes are expected to win more medals, and, second, there is also a marked host effect that will likely bump up the number of medals.
<br />The upshot is that the report predicts Britain will win 30 gold medals and 65 medals in total, which is a whopping 18 more medals than it won at the Beijing Olympics. China, meanwhile, will have ex-host hangover, winning 33 gold medals versus 50 when it hosted the games in 2008.
<br />The team of economists at Goldman Sachs forecast that the United States will again win the lion's share of medals.
<br />It predicts that the top 10 ranks will include five G7 countries (the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy), two BRICs (China and Russia) and one additional developed and emerging market (Australia and Ukraine, respectively).
<br />&quot;Based on our analysis, these 10 countries will likely capture more than half of all medals attained during the Games,&quot; the report says.
<br />Betting race
<br />In the lead up to the Olympics, the Goldman Sachs forecasts will be competing against other predictions as people around the world follow - and in many cases wage a bet - the medal outcomes of the long-awaited London 2012 Olympics.
<br />The report expects the London Olympics will increase Britain's GDP by 1.2 per cent to 1.6 per cent on an annualised basis - a much-needed boost given the state of the economy right now.
<br />It says past experience indicates that hosting the Olympics improves tourism and infrastructure and lifts local wages and tax revenues. The report notes the games also lifts prices.
<br />&quot;There are two advantages to using house prices as a barometer to measure the impact of the Olympics on the host city. First, housing markets are intrinsically local and, as a result, the economic impact on local house prices should be more noticeable than that on nation measures, such as stock prices or country exports. Second, house prices potentially capture both the benefits and any local costs associated with hosting the Games,&quot; the report says.
<br />Australian experience
<br />Tim Toohey, an Australian economist at Goldman Sachs says in the report when Australia hosted the Olympic Games in 2000 it bagged 58 medals (16 gold, 25 silver and 17 bronze), placing it fourth on the medal tally, behind China (59 medals), Russia (88 medals) and the USA (92 medals).
<br />This rally elevated it up the ranks and in the forthcoming Olympics, Australia is expected to win one extra gold this time around.
<br />But Toohey says a detailed study of costing by the NSW Auditor General found that the NSW government made a loss of $1.3 billion on its hosting.
<br />The AG found that despite the boost to tourism and national recognition of hosting the games, the benefits may not be worth the costs.
<br />Studies such as The Sydney Olympics, Seven Years On: An Ex-Post Dynamic CGE Assessment by Madden and Giesecke from Monash University, conclude that the Sydney Olympics delivered a net economic loss for the Australian economy of more than $2 billion over the period from 1997-98 to 2005-06.

<br /><br />Police said the baby was discovered by an X-ray screening at Sharjah International Airport as the couple was traveling through the airport.
<br /><br />The infant is in good condition, police said.
<br /><br />According to Sharjah police, the couple arrived in the UAE last Friday but were not allowed to enter the country because they didn't have a visa for the infant.
<br /><br />The parents were told they had to wait two days at the airport until the visa office reopened so the boy's documents could be processed.
<br /><br />On Saturday, the impatient father persuaded his wife to put the baby in their hand luggage in the hope airport security wouldn't notice, police said.
<br /><br />&quot;We were very surprised. This is the first time we have seen something like this,&quot; police officer Abdel Rahman Shama said. &quot;Even if you are in a desperate situation, how can you put your child in a bag?&quot;

One of the things it does best is set a comedic tone through the interaction of all the characters that persists throughout the story, which only lets up when the film dabbles into some of the more serious issues that the characters must work through, which really helps drive those points home <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZW5lZW9sc3RlYWQuY29tL2Jsb2cvbHVjaWE_" target="_blank">LUCIA'S BLOG</a></strong>. The film stars Jason Ritter and Jake Sandvig as Ben and Alan, two best friends who escaped their bad childhoods by running off together and learning to fend for themselves. And learn they did, as the two run a successful business boosting cars by posing as valets at funerals. They then bring the car to their “boss, ” Marty (Todd Louiso), who buys them for cash .Discount Mulberry Bags. All in all, this allows Ben and Alan to live a rather comfortable, worry-free life, where they do as they like, while also helping out Alan’s sister, Mel (Rebecca Hall), financially as well. Things take an unexpected turn, however, when Alan and Ben rent out the property they own that’s adjacent to theirs to a mother and her young <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mbGl4eWEuY29tL3VzZXIvQmlsbFVyZXkvYmxvZ3M_" target="_blank">BillUrey's New Blogs</a></strong>. The woman, Lynette (Carrie Preston) immediately asks Alan if it’s okay that she pays her rent a bit late, to which Alan lowers the rent on the spot and tells her not to worry. While this would help most, Lynette is having some serious problems finding work, and with an ex-husband who wants nothing to do with her or her son Kelsey (Chandler Canterbury), things are bound to get worse before they get better. It doesn’t take long before Mel begins to suspect Lynette of neglecting her son, which leads to a series of events that nobody could have expected – least of all Ben and Alan, who are finally forced to look in a mirror and see if they’re really living their lives the way they should be. While A Bag of Hammers maintains a solid message throughout (if you ignore the fact that these two guys are petty thieves), there’s a serious lack of obstacles for the two main characters to overcome, as everything constantly falls in their favour, be it by luck, coincidence, or a bit of both .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iYWdzYW5kYm93c29ubGluZS5jb20vc2hvcGRlbHV4ZS9ob21lL2hvbWVqc3A_" target="_blank">bags in discount</a></strong>. This causes the film to lose a bit of credibility, as it never really feels like there’s anything truly at stake for anyone involved. Even though the overall lighthearted tone of the film makes it somewhat understandable why co-writers Brian Crano and Sandvig didn’t delve deep into the dramatic aspects of the story, it’s still not ideal to make it so that there’s rarely any consequences or opposing factors to a film’s protagonists, as it just takes away from the overall product. That said, Hammers is still enjoyable, and quite funny, thanks to the great chemistry that Ritter and Sandvig share on screen. The two act as if they really have known one another since childhood, and the back and forth discussions between the two really are the highlights of the film. It must also be said that Ritter is a wonderful talent, as he really embodies the slacker with a heart character of Ben perfectly. While Sandvig is also great (along with the excellent supporting cast), Ritter really takes the part he was given and hits a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWJhZ3NvdXRsZXRjbHViLmNvLnVrL2JheXN3YXRlci1jLTYuaHRtbA__" target="_blank">Mulberry Bayswater Outlet</a></strong>. Shortcomings aside, A Bag of Hammers is definitely worth watching, especially if you’re in the mood for some lighthearted fun mixed with a great underlying message, and a few heavier moments as the film progresses. The audio/video transfer for the film is solid throughout. The video quality is strong in the Blu-ray format, with sharp images, strong colours and an overall great look that suits the films themes – especially in one of the final scenes. The audio quality is also well done, with dialogue and soundtrack mixing perfectly with no strain anywhere in sight. Behind the Scenes – This is a featurette that runs just under 11 minutes in length which sees co-writer/director Brian Crano talk about the film, the messages and just how it all came to be. Ritter and Sandvig also share their thoughts on the film, along with other members of the supporting cast. A Bag of Hammers has some great themes behind it, and while the overall structure of the film may not be the strongest, the ideas presented come across clearly enough that one can see the positives in what the writers were trying to express. This, along with some great acting and an overall enjoyable, eccentric tone help make A Bag of Hammers worth recommending.

<br /><br />Ease of product display, simple and timeless design, and a central island “that would provoke circulation around the store” were also important, but, overall, there was one big factor at play.
<br /><br />“We wanted to do something that was different as it was our first small store, ” says Davy, of the brand’s somewhat hesitant decision to move into Westfield Doncaster in Melbourne.
<br /><br />“Previous to this site we had a lot of strip shops. When you’re doing streets it comes with the character that the building around it has, ” he says.
<br /><br />“So we just didn’t feel right to go into a mall and putting in a glass front. We’d have just been part of that experience when you’re wandering around a mall and all of the stores look the same. ”
<br /><br />Luckily, Crumpler knew just the right people for that dilemma. Russell &amp; George, a partnership between Ryan Russell and Byron George, creates the unexpected, whether it’s for commercial, hospitality, or retail.
<br /><br />For instance, for skincare retailer, Aesop, which was also its first shopping centre site, the firm implemented a shopfront with an air gap, so that alluring scents can be wafted out to pedestrians.
<br /><br />Inspiration
<br /><br />“We tend to try and design for the shopping centre. It’s a forgotten experience, ” says Russell.
<br /><br />“A lot of people expect it to be the same so we try and reinvent all the components. What that eventually means is that you get people to go into the store. ”
<br />The 86sqm result literally represents Crumpler: it’s made of bags.
<br /><br />“We really liked the idea of building a store out of the materials that our product is from, ” says Davy of the 20 year old brand, which started out in Ballarat in rural Victoria.
<br /><br />“The [Doncaster] store is about promoting the idea that our bags are so tough, that you can literally make a store out of them. ”
<br /><br />Features are crafted from unusual elements, such as rubber lining, buckles and clips, powder-coated steel, and the brand’s iconic red seatbelt-style bag straps.
<br />This latter element was destined to become the hero of the space, with red “webbing” engulfing the glass shopfront and laced across the walls of the rectangular store.
<br />It’s a design feature that’s not just visually impressive, but functional, with the wall webbing incorporating hooks to hang Crumpler’s iconic product from .<strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWJhZ3NvdXRsZXRjbHViLmNvLnVrL3dhbGxldHMtYy0xLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">Mulberry Wallets</a></strong>.
<br /><br />Award winning
<br /><br />But achieving this – something Davy says he’s “not seen anybody else do” – was easier said than done, with materials needing to be stringently tested to ensure they were malleable, strong, and wouldn’t fray.
<br /><br />“We had to experiment with what the webbing was capable of. We didn’t quite understand it, and had to test it quite stringently in our office, ” says Russell.
<br /><br />“That bit was a lot of fun. There was a lot of prototyping done in our office and ideas flowing back and forth with the guys at Crumpler. ”
<br /><br />All that testing is now paying off. After launching in September 2010, the space has received a bunch of awards, including the Australian Interior design award for Retail Design in 2011.
<br /><br />The store has also been recognised globally, with two World Retail Awards at the 2012 International Store Design Awards Gala held at New York’s iconic Times Square.
<br /><br />Functional features
<br /><br />But it’s not just the webbing that’s gathering attention, with one of Crumpler’s central requests, the grandstand, also privy to special design features.
<br /><br />“When people come into Crumpler stores, they tend to bring their current bags and empty out their contents and try it to see if it will fit in a new one, ” says Russell.
<br /><br />Any central display counter has to essentially double as a customer testing area, with heavy-duty Crumpler buyers like professional photographers needing to unpack objects like lenses to see how they’ll they’ll fare.
<br /><br />“This meant we needed a lot of space for people to essentially get their stuff out and try the <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tdWxiZXJyeWJhZ3NvdXRsZXRjbHViLmNvLnVrL3NhdGNoZWwtYy0xMC5odG1s" target="_blank">Mulberry Satchel</a></strong>. We really think the central island allows for this, ” says Russell.
<br />One of its most thoughtful details is “a subtle lip” that rolls upwards, meaning that a customer’s emptied out contents, from loose coins to camera lenses, won’t roll onto the floor.
<br /><br />“It is simple stuff like that which allows people to play around with the bags. At the end of the day, Crumpler really, really wants them to try their bags out, ” says Russell.
<br />While elements of the Doncaster site, namely the webbing, is incorporated at other stores, Davy says the award-winning space won’t be seen in all Crumpler stores.
<br /><br />“We haven’t really rolled it out anywhere else. We don’t like to do that, ” he says.
<br /><br />“We approach each location fresh and keep the same principles. It’s about provoking circulation and having the grandstand. It’s all site specific design. ”
<br /><br />For instance, Crumpler’s Fitzroy site is made out of concrete paving slabs stacked to form grandstands, whereas in Perth there is a focus on blue metal framing.
<br /><br />Over in New york in the hip West Village, Crumpler is all about a contemporary warehouse feel.
<br /><br />“In New york, we wanted it to feel like an art gallery so it’s very clean. Wherever we go, it’s about standing out from the area, but also paying homage to where we are located, ” says Davy.
<br /><br />Mostly designed by Russell &amp; George, of course: so far the firm has had more than a finger in six of Crumpler’s stores.
<br /><br />“Ryan and I work very, very closely together. It’s a very collaborative process, ” says Davy.

<br />Demonstrations in Asia are often ultra gentle.
<br /><br />There was one in Tokyo last week where suit-wearing protesters marched in V For Vendetta masks, picking up garbage along the way.
<br /><br />In the West, demonstrators may burn down McDonald's. Here, we just do a little tidying up.
<br /><br />Of course, even us mild- mannered Asians do get out of hand sometimes.
<br /><br />In Hong Kong, police recently warned that protesters are becoming dangerously rowdy, after one &quot;stuck stickers on a police motorbike&quot; and another &quot;blew a whistle near an officer's ear.&quot;
<br /><br />Whoa, shocking stuff.
<br /><br />Our police might like to check out the general rate of public violence in the West. In New York, if a driver fails to respond instantly to a green traffic light, enraged motorists burn down the city. And that's on a good day.
<br /><br />A reader sent me a clipping from the Chicago Sun-Times about a bid to cut the rate of violence. Last month, the city's police offered US$100 (HK$780) for each weapon handed in for destruction.
<br /><br />A pro-gun lobby organized the delivery of old, rusty firearms - and then used the cash to pay for a youth camp to promote weapon ownership.
<br /><br />In most of Asia, gun violence is rare, as we are strict about all sorts of things, sometimes too strict.
<br /><br />Which leads me to the news that Singapore has just announced it is dropping its famous mandatory death penalty for drug crimes.
<br /><br />I hope it means the death of that unnerving airline announcement: &quot;We are now beginning our descent into Singapore. And remember, if you have drugs, you will be executed. Thank you.&quot; *** News that China is to build a Tibet theme park excited reader Dan Kubiske.
<br /><br />Instead of the famous Disneyland ride where cheery voices sing &quot;It's a small world after all&quot; - at the new park they can sing &quot;It's all our world after all.&quot;
<br /><br />Dan foresees the Beijing politburo creating an attraction called The Splittist Log Flume Ride.
<br /><br />&quot;Riders decide which route to take,&quot; he said. Those who pick the correct way see an artist's rendition of life under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party. Those who choose the wrong path go to jail. *** A man recently barricaded himself in his hotel room in North Carolina and demanded that the authorities bring him pizza and Paris Hilton, not necessarily in that order.
<br /><br />Officers pepper-sprayed him and &quot;took him to hospital for a mental evaluation,&quot; the police report said. Why, because he asked for pizza?

Tammy Gallow is a registered nurse and registered dietitian with ProHealth Care, Waukesha. She says it's absolutely critical to get a student's day off to a healthy start.
<br /><br />&quot;There's been so many research studies dating back to the 1950s that have shown over and over again that children who eat breakfast perform much better than their peers who skip that meal.&quot;
<br /><br />According to the American Heart Association, eating a diet high in fat, sodium and sugar can lead to obesity and other health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
<br /><br />No matter what your age, Gallow says there are some huge red flags in preparing meals, whether it's a bag lunch or sit-down dinner at home.
<br /><br />&quot;Avoid any food that contains high-fructose corn syrup or partially hydrogenated fats or trans-fats. These are artificial compounds that do not belong in a human body.&quot;
<br /><br />Gallow says if you have a picky eater, try having them help choose what food should go into the lunch bag. For help and ideas on what to pack, Gallow suggests online resources such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myplate.gov"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.myplate.gov</a>. Active play is also an important factor, she adds: Youngsters should get 60 minutes of exercise every day.
<br /><br />No matter how tired you are at the end of the day, Gallow says packing lunch for your child can be much more significant in their development than you might imagine. This was brought home to her when her son was appointed to West Point.
<br /><br />&quot;The night before we were to be driving him and drop him off at West Point, he came to me and said, 'Mom, would you pack me one last lunch?'&quot;

<br /><br />The Gardinier brothers have been involved in agriculture for decades. For them it’s a family tradition that dates back generations. With vineyards in France and citrus groves in Florida, they are more than just farmers. They are cultivators of the land. For them, it is truly a passion that runs deep in their history and in their blood.
<br /><br />It is no different for Lee C. Jones, the Gardiniers’ agricultural manager. Jones comes from a long line of farmers and has worked the soil to cultivate a wide range of fruits, vegetables and flowers.
<br /><br />It was little surprise that when they got together that Jones and the Gardinier brothers bonded over their love of professional gardening, as well as their own personal gardens and the rewards that a garden can bring. When they started contemplating a modular gardening solution, it did not take long for the idea of H2grOw to be born.
<br /><br />H2grOw was originally created as a way for missionaries to become self-sustaining in third world countries. Lee and the Gardiniers quickly realized that they could not only help those in the field, but also lend their experience to help anyone enjoy the pleasures of raising their own garden from seed to table; no matter what they wanted to grow.
<br /><br />With a patented self-irrigating system and customized soil blend right in the bag, the H2grOw bag is fully enclosed and ready to go. There are no weeds, no soil-borne insects, or no need to fertilize. Grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers right out of the bag.
<br /><br />H2grOw bags are available in two sizes: 12-pound and 25-pound bags.
<br /><br />For more information and to order products online, go to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.H2grOw.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.H2grOw.com</a>.
<br /><br />The Business Development Board of Martin County coordinated with the company, the Indiantown Chamber of Commerce and others to facilitate the ceremony and promote the launch.
<br /><br />“The BDBMC is excited to assist this new small business and will continue to work with the company on Enterprise Zone opportunities and future expansion needs” said Timothy Dougher, executive director, Business Development Board of Martin County.

Comparable sales are one method used to determine a building's market value.
<br /><br />Still, with other factors at play, total taxable property value in Lafayette Parish rose to $1.73 billion, up from $1.64 billion last year, Comeaux says. 
<br /><br />When reassessment occurs every four years as mandated by state law, the assessor’s office has three methods to choose from when valuing property in Lafayette Parish: the income approach, based on income derived from that property; cost approach, what would it cost to replace the building; and market approach, based upon the sale and lease prices of buildings.
<br /><br />One area of town that saw a significant increase in property values is downtown, where Comeaux says his employees spent more time this year measuring buildings and capturing characteristics that affect valuation. 
<br /><br />“Most of the large buildings downtown went up significantly,” he says. 
<br /><br />As The Independent noted in its Feb. 22 cover story, “Downtown Development,” several commercial buildings in and around Jefferson Street listed seemingly low values and subsequently received a smaller property tax bill every year. 
<br /><br />Among the businesses found downtown, Antler’s, Frankie’s and Agave on Vermilion Street were some of the commercial properties with the lowest values. Agave, the thriving Mexican cantina that’s listed on the assessor’s website as an office building valued at $31,966, had paid $410 a year in property taxes for the past four years. 
<br /><br />The official public inspection period for property owners looking to review their reassessments at the assessor’s office is Aug. 31 - Sept. 15, though Comeaux says residents are welcome to review their reassessments at his office any time before Sept. 15. 
<br /><br />Comeaux notes that so far, the only two public agencies that have opted to “roll back” their millage rates and remain revenue neutral on their property tax collections are the Lafayette Economic Development Authority and the Teche-Vermilion Freshwater District. All others so far have “rolled forward” their millage rates to collect additional revenues this year.
