<br /><br />Where to grow Soft Fruit grow well in most soil types but ideally should be grown in well-drained, loamy soil that is not too heavy. The soil needs to be deep, well dug and with plenty of well-rotted organ1c matter incorporated. The plot should be cleared and dug over prior to planting.
<br /><br />Do not plant fruit in the same place as an earlier planting of the same type that has just been removed. Always make sure that strawberries do not follow potatoes or strawberries to avoid Verticillium Wilt infection. (If possible, leave at least 5 years between growing strawberries in the same place).
<br /><br />What to do when you receive your Soft Fruit On receipt, unpack the plants immediately. In all cases, aim to plant as soon as possible after receipt as this will reduce the possibility of the roots starting to dry out. Allowing the roots to de-hydrate before planting is probably the single most likely cause of plants failing to re-establish and we cannot be expected to replace free-of-charge any plants which fail to grow satisfactorily through customer neglect.
<br /><br />If you can't plant straightaway - because the ground is very wet, or frozen for example - store the plants in an unheated building such as a shed or garage, making sure the roots are moistened and covered with a sack or polythene. Alternatively, dig a hole in a sheltered position and 'heel in' the roots temporarily.
<br /><br />Keep the compost of container grown plants moist but not saturated.
<br /><br />Planting Soak the roots of all bare root plants in a bucket of water for a couple of hours before planting. Dig a hole wide enough and deep enough to take all the roots without them being doubled up.
<br /><br />Plant Strawberries and Rhubarb so that when the planting hole is back filled and the soil pressed down firmly, the base of the growing crown is set level with the soil surface.
<br /><br />Set Raspberries, Currants and Gooseberries so that the soil mark on the stems is about 1-2in/2.5-5cm below the surface after the hole has been back filled and the soil pressed down firmly.
<br /><br />Remove the root ball of container grown Berries from the pot intact and re-plant in a hole that is just deeper that height of the root ball. Back fill any gaps and level off with the soil that was removed to make the hole, firm in and water thoroughly.
<br /><br />Positions and Spacings Blackberries &amp; Hybrid Berries Plant in well-drained but moisture retentive soil in full sun or partial shade. Grow on wires against a fence or wall or as single plants up a post. Space at least 6fV2m apart. Cut back to 10in/25cm straight after planting to promote fresh growth from the base.
<br /><br />Currants Plant in moisture retentive soil in an open position in full sun or partial shade.
<br />Avoid planting in a position where the bushes might catch a late spring frost which will damage any emerging leaves and new growth. Space bushes 3-4fV1-1.25m apart. After planting, cut blackcurrants down to 3-4in/8-10cm above ground level, and cut the stems of red and white currants back by about half.
<br /><br />Gooseberries Plant in deep, well-drained but moisture retentive soil in full sun or partial
<br /><br />shade. Avoid planting in shallow soil which dries out in summer as this will result in poor sized fruit. Also avoid sites liable to catch late spring frosts. Space bushes 4ft/1.25m apart.
<br />Cut stems back by about half after planting. This is very important for successful establishment.
<br /><br />Raspberries Plant in deep, rich well-drained but moisture retentive soil in a sunny or partially shaded position. Space canes 15-18in/40-45cm apart. Allow 4-6ft/1.25-2m between rows of floricane (summer-fruiting) varieties and at least 6ft/2m between rows of primocane (autumn-fruiting) varieties. Cut back to 12in/30cm after planting. Keep soil moist until canes get established.
<br /><br />Strawberries Plant in an open, sunny position in soil which is rich in humus. Set plants 18in/45cm apart in rows 30in/75cm apart. After planting, water thoroughly. If no rainfall occurs during the first few weeks after they have been planted, water regularly to keep the soil moist until plants re-establish.
<br /><br />Pruning and Aftercare Blackberries &amp; Hybrid Berries During autumn or winter each year remove canes that have fruited to ground level and train and tie in the new growth that has grown up from the base during the summer. In late spring cut out the tips of the leading canes to promote the growth of extra fruiting laterals.
<br /><br />Currants Blackcurrants fruit on new wood so aim to remove a third of the old wood each year, taking out at or near ground level the oldest branches (those with the darkest wood).
<br />Unlike Blackcurrants, Red and White currants fruit on two year old wood so require only that the leading shoots are shortened by about half of the previous year's growth each year to encourage branching. If and when the bush becomes crowded, remove the occasional branch to open it up to allow air to circulate more freely.
<br /><br />Gooseberries Aim to build up a well-shaped bush by annually cutting out crossing branches from the centre in the spring before bud break. Also cut out any diseased or damaged wood.
<br /><br />Raspberries Floricane (summer-fruiting) varieties fruit on canes produced in the previous year. After fruiting, cut out the old, fruited wood in autumn/winter and tie in the new growths to the support, ideally leaving 8 strong canes per 3ft/1 m run. Primocane (autumn-fruiting) varieties fruit on canes produced in the current year. After cropping, these should be cut down to ground level to promote the growth of new canes. Allow primocane raspberry beds to spread up to 2.5ft/O.75m wide but dig out any canes which start to grow between the rows.
<br /><br />Strawberries Once new growth starts in the spring, remove the old foliage but take care not to damage the growing crown. Replace with fresh, certified stock in a new bed in a different part of the plot every 3-4 years.
<br /><br />Feeding and watering An application of a high potash fertiliser at the rate suggested on the pack will increase yields. Avoid fertilisers high in nitrogen as these will tend to promote too much soft, leafy growth. All soft fruit needs plenty of moisture, particularly round about flowering time which is when the fruit start to form. In dry spells it is recommended that the crop is watered every 10 days or so. NB. Check for any current local watering restrictions before doing this. An occasional heavy watering is better than little and often as this does not get down far enough and encourages shallow rooting.

<br /><br />My friends are those who always cared,
<br />And know my faults and always shared,
<br />The good- the bad and all the grey,
<br />And held my hand and showed the way.
<br /><br />But, I love them most for the times we've spent,
<br />The laughter, tears, and for what they meant,
<br />To me- my life and things we've shared,
<br />But I loved them most because they cared.

<br />To a single soul I know 
<br />I keep it as my secret 
<br />She's the only one I'll show 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? 
<br />I try as I can to avoid her 
<br />She's in my thoughts and dreams 
<br />Each time I find she's near me 
<br />I fall for her, it seems 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />When I see her for a moment 
<br />She's the only thing on my mind 
<br />And when we go our separate ways 
<br />It's a longing that I find 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />Even when I'm far away 
<br />And she's nowhere to be found 
<br />I think of her so many times 
<br />And my heart begins to pound 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />I've known her now for many years 
<br />It's rare when it's just us two 
<br />I dream of whispering into her ear 
<br />The thoughts that are so true 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />I have my deep desires 
<br />And I know what's right to do 
<br />But when I catch her twinkling eyes 
<br />I just don't have a clue 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />The loveliest one I've ever known 
<br />No one holds a candle to her 
<br />It's only in my mind it seems 
<br />Those thoughts begin to stir 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />She lives within her own world 
<br />And I dwell deep in mine 
<br />So many times I think of her 
<br />Those thoughts so sweet and fine 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />In reality it could not happen 
<br />Cause we're just not meant to be 
<br />Yet when I have those thoughts of her 
<br />It's only those dreams I see 
<br />? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ? * ?
<br />Like so many dreams we dream 
<br />Reality they won't defer 
<br />Yet deep within my heart I find 
<br />There's no one quite like her

<br /><br />A woman meets a man in a bar.
<br />They talk; they connect; they end
<br />up leaving together.
<br /><br />They get back to his place,
<br /><br />and as he shows her around his
<br />apartment.
<br /><br />She notices that one wall of his
<br />bedroom is 
<br /><br />completely filled with soft, sweet, 
<br />cuddly teddy bears.
<br /><br />There are three shelves in the 
<br />bedroom, 
<br /><br />with hundreds and hundreds of cute,
<br />cuddly teddy bears carefully placed
<br />in rows, covering the entire wall!
<br /><br />It was obvious that he had taken
<br />quite some time to lovingly arrange them 
<br />and she was immediately touched
<br /><br />by the amount of thought he had
<br />put into organizing the display.
<br /><br />There were small bears all along 
<br />the bottom shelf, 
<br />medium-sized bears covering the 
<br />length of the middle shelf, 
<br /><br />and huge, enormous bears running
<br />all the way along the top shelf.
<br /><br />She found it strange for an
<br />obviously masculine guy 
<br /><br />to have such a large collection of
<br />Teddy Bears,
<br /><br />She is quite impressed by his
<br />sensitive side.
<br /><br />but doesn't mention this to him.
<br /><br />They share a bottle of wine and
<br />continue talking and, 
<br /><br />after awhile, she finds herself
<br />thinking,
<br /><br />'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy
<br />could be the one!
<br /><br />Maybe he could be the future
<br />father of my children?' 
<br /><br />She turns to him and kisses him
<br />lightly on the lips 
<br /><br />He responds warmly. 
<br /><br />They continue to kiss, the passion
<br />builds,
<br /><br />and he romantically lifts her in
<br />his arms and carries her into his bedroom 
<br /><br />where they rip off each other's
<br />clothes and make hot, steamy love.
<br />She is so overwhelmed that she
<br />responds with more passion, 
<br /><br />more creativity, more heat than she
<br />has ever known. 
<br /><br />After an intense, explosive night
<br />of raw passion with this sensitive guy, 
<br /><br />they are lying there together in
<br />the afterglow. 
<br /><br />The woman rolls over, gently 
<br />strokes his chest and asks coyly,
<br /><br />'Well,how was it?'
<br /><br />The guy gently smiles at her, 
<br /><br />strokes her cheek,
<br /><br />looks deeply into her eyes, 
<br /><br />and says: 
<br /><br />'Help yourself to any prize
<br /><br />from the middle shelf&quot;
<br /><br />I am sending this to you with best wishes and kind regards ( eric xxxxxx

<br />Today was Daddy's Day at school, and she couldn't wait to go. 
<br /><br />But her mommy tried to tell her, that she probably should stay home.   
<br />Why the kids might not understand,  If she went to school alone 
<br /><br />But she was not afraid; she knew just what to say.   
<br />What to tell her classmates of why he wasn't there today. 
<br /><br />But still her mother worried, for her to face this day alone.   
<br />And that was why once again, she tried to keep her daughter home. 
<br /><br />But the little girl went to school eager to tell them all. About a dad she never sees  
<br />A dad who never calls. 
<br /><br />There were daddies along the wall in back, for everyone to meet.   
<br />Children squirming impatiently anxious in their seats.   
<br /><br />One by one the teacher called  a student from the class.   
<br />To introduce their daddy, as seconds slowly passed. 
<br /><br />At last the teacher called her name, every child turned to stare.   
<br />Each of them was searching, for a man who wasn't there. 
<br /><br />'Where's her daddy at?'   She heard a boy call out.   
<br />'She probably doesn't have one,'   another student dared to shout. 
<br /><br />And from somewhere near the back, she heard a daddy say,   
<br />'Looks like another deadbeat dad, too busy to waste his day.' 
<br /><br />The words did not offend her, as she smiled up at her Mom. 
<br />And looked back at her teacher, who told her to go on. 
<br /><br />And with hands behind her back, slowly she began to speak.   
<br />And out from the mouth of a child, came words incredibly unique. 
<br /><br />'My Daddy couldn't be here, because he lives so far away.   
<br />But I know he wishes he could be, since this is such a special day. 
<br /><br />And though you cannot meet him, I wanted you to know.   
<br />All about my daddy, and how much he loves me so. 
<br /><br />He loved to tell me stories he taught me to ride my bike.   
<br />He surprised me with pink roses, and taught me to fly a kite. 
<br /><br />We used to share fudge sundaes, and ice cream in a cone.   
<br />And though you cannot see him. I'm not standing here alone. 
<br /><br />'Cause my daddy's always with me, even though we are apart   
<br />I know because he told me, He'll forever be in my heart'. 
<br /><br />With that, her little hand reached up, and lay across her chest.   
<br />Feeling her own heartbeat, beneath her favourite dress. 
<br /><br />And from somewhere here in the crowd of dads, her mother stood in tears.   
<br />Proudly watching her daughter, who was wise beyond her years. 
<br /><br />For she stood up for the love of a man not in her life.   
<br />Doing what was best for her, doing what was right. 
<br /><br />And when she dropped her hand back down, staring straight into the crowd.   
<br />She finished with a voice so soft, but its message clear and loud. 
<br /><br />'I love my daddy very much, he's my shining star.   
<br />And if he could, he'd be here, but heaven's just too far. 
<br /><br />You see he was a policeman and died just this past year 
<br />When airplanes hit the towers and taught Americans to fear. 
<br /><br />But sometimes when I close my eyes, it's like he never went away.'   
<br />And then she closed her eyes, and saw him there that day. 
<br /><br />And to her mothers amazement, she witnessed with surprise.   
<br />A room full of daddies and children, all starting to close their eyes. 
<br /><br />Who knows what they saw before them, who knows what they felt inside.   
<br />Perhaps for merely a second, they saw him at her side. 
<br /><br />'I know you're with me Daddy,' to the silence she called out. 
<br />And what happened next made believers, of those once filled with doubt. 
<br /><br />Not one in that room could explain it, for each of their eyes had been closed.   
<br />But there on the desk beside her, was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose. 
<br /><br />And a child was blessed, if only for a moment, by the love of her shining star.   
<br />And given the gift of believing, that heaven is never too far. 
<br /><br />They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them. 
<br /><br />Send this to the people you'll never forget, and remember to send it also to the person that sent it to you. It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them. 
<br /><br />If you don't send it to anyone, it means you're in a hurry and that you've forgotten your 
<br />friends. 
<br /><br />Take the time...to live and love

<br />We had sex all afternoon.'
<br />She looked down at his shoes and said:
<br />'You lying bastard!
<br />You've been p laying golf!'
<br /><br />The 2nd Affair
<br />A middle-aged couple had two beautiful daughters
<br />but always talked about having a son.
<br />They decided to try one last time
<br />for the son they always wanted.
<br />The wife got pregnant
<br />and  delivered a healthy baby boy.
<br />The joyful father rushed to the nursery
<br />to  see his new son.
<br />He was horrified at the ugliest child
<br />he had ever seen.
<br />He told his wife:  'There's no way I can
<br />be the father of this baby.
<br />Look  at the  two beautiful daughters I  fathered!
<br />Have  you  been fooling around behind my back?'
<br />The  wife smiled sweetly and replied:
<br />'Not this time!'
<br /><br />The 3rd Affair
<br />A mortician was working late one night.
<br />He examined the body of Mr. Schwartz,
<br />about  to be cremated,
<br />and made a startling discovery.
<br />Schwartz  had the largest private part
<br />he had ever seen!
<br />'I'm sorry Mr. Schwartz,' the mortician
<br />commented, 'I can't allow you to be cremated
<br />with such an impressive private part.
<br />It must be saved for posterity.'
<br />So, he removed it,
<br />stuffed it into his briefcase,
<br />and took it home
<br />'I  have something to show
<br />you won't believe,' he said to his wife,
<br />opening his briefcase.
<br />'My  God!' the wife exclaimed,
<br />'Schwartz is dead!'
<br /><br />The  4th Affair
<br />A  woman was in bed with her lover
<br />when  she heard her husband
<br />opening  the front door.
<br />'Hurry,' she said, 'stand in the corner.'
<br />She  rubbed baby oil all over him,
<br />then  dusted him with talcum powder.
<br />'Don't  move until I tell you,'
<br />she said, 'pretend you're a statue.'
<br />'What's  this?' the husband inquired
<br />as he entered the room.
<br />'Oh it's a statue,' she replied,
<br />'the Smiths bought one and I liked it
<br />so I got one for us, too.'
<br />No more was said,
<br />not even when they went to bed.
<br />Around 2 AM the husband got up,
<br />went to the kitchen and returned
<br />with a sandwich and a beer.
<br />'Here,' he said to the statue, have this.
<br />I stood like that for two days at the Smiths
<br />and nobody offered me a damned thing.'
<br /><br />The  5th Affair
<br />A man walked into a cafe,
<br />went to the bar and ordered a beer.
<br />'Certainly, Sir, that'll be one cent.'
<br />'One  Cent?' the man exclaimed.
<br />He glanced at the menu and asked:
<br />'How much for a nice juicy steak
<br />and a bottle of wine?'
<br />'A  nickel,' the barman  replied.
<br />'A  nickel?' exclaimed the man.
<br />'Where's the guy who owns this place?'
<br />The  bartender replied:
<br />'Upstairs, with my wife.'
<br />The man asked: 'What's he doing upstairs
<br />with your wife?'
<br />The  bartender replied:
<br />'The  same thing I'm doing
<br />to his business down here.'
<br /><br />The  6th Affair
<br />jake was dying. His wife sat at the bedside.
<br />He looked up and said weakly:
<br />'I have something I must confess.'
<br />'There's no need to, 'his wife replied.
<br />'No,' he insisted,
<br />'I want to die in peace.
<br />I slept with your sister, your best friend,
<br />her best friend, and your mother!'
<br />'I know,' she replied,
<br />'now just rest and let the poison work.'

<br />foursome of men playing the next hole. The ball hit one of the men. He immediately clasped his hands
<br />together at his groin, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony.
<br /><br />The woman rushed down to the man, and immediately began to apologize.
<br /><br />'Please allow me to help. I'm a Physical Therapist and I know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow 
<br />me,' she told him.
<br />'Oh, no, I'll be all right. I'll be fine in a few minutes,' the man replied.
<br />He was in obvious agony, lying in the fetal position, still clasping his hands together at his groin.
<br />At her persistence, however, he finally allowed her to help.
<br /><br />She gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, loosened his pants and put her hands inside.
<br />She administered tender and artful massage for several long moments and asked, 'How does that feel'?
<br /><br />He replied: 'It feels great, but I still think my thumb's broken.'

<br /><br />Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room. 
<br /><br />One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs.
<br />His bed was next to the room ' s only window.
<br /><br />The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. 
<br /><br />The men talked for hours on end.
<br />They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation. 
<br /><br />Every afternoon,  when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.
<br /><br />The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside. 
<br /><br />The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.
<br />Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. 
<br /><br />As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene.
<br /><br />One warm afternoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by. 
<br /><br />Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind ' s eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. 
<br /><br />Days, weeks and months passed.
<br /><br />One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep.
<br />She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. 
<br /><br />As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. 
<br /><br />Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside.
<br />He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed.
<br /><br />It faced a blank wall.
<br /><br />The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. 
<br /><br />The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall.
<br /><br />She said, 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.' 
<br /><br />Epilogue:
<br /><br />There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations. 
<br /><br />Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled. 
<br /><br />If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can ' t buy. 
<br /><br />'Today is a gift, that is why it is called   The Present ..'
<br /><br />The origin of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to everyone who passes it on. 
<br /><br />Do not keep this letter.
<br /><br />Just forward it to your friends to whom you wish blessings.

<br />in a park, watching children and their mothers enjoying a beautiful
