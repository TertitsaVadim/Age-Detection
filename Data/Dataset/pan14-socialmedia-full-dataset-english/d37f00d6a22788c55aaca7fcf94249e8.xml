<br /><br />We will try our best to win a match always.
<br /><br />Why? Why we want to perform so well and to be the winner?
<br /><br />However, what is the purpose to win?
<br /><br />Because of glory? Because of they need to show off? Because of the prize? 
<br /><br />Or just because we don't want to lose face? 
<br /><br />Or whatever we can do in a match, it is to win? 
<br /><br />Or we must to win, there is no way to be lost?
<br /><br />Or others?
<br /><br />Did you really think about the reasons to win?
<br /><br />Or maybe wining the match is the reason why we will attend the match?
<br /><br />Or you even don't think it is needed to find a reason on doing so?
<br /><br />One of my friends told me that if we can keep wining the match on any field, it can make us to feel the power of our country.
<br /><br />Is it true?
<br /><br />Should we need to find the confidence from this?
<br /><br />Is it really can present the strengths of a nation?
<br /><br />For me, match is not just win.
<br /><br />Match is a way of proving or testing the growth.
<br /><br />Yes, I know that nobody likes lose.
<br /><br />But our lives are fulled of lose rather than success.
<br /><br />Most of us are always feeling the failure, are not we?
<br /><br />Another question to be announced during this kind of thinkgings, is always success means  successful in deed?
<br /><br />If it is true, then most of great leaders and scientists are not successful.
<br /><br />But are they successful?
<br /><br />Yes, they do.
<br /><br />So it means, always success does not prove that it is successful.
<br /><br />Success just like the flowers, they have the limitations. 
<br /><br />Who can be successful through out his life without any failures?
<br /><br />It is the same concept of match.
<br /><br />We are always growing up, no matter you are willing to accept or not.
<br /><br />A match just the method of compairing the levels of growth.
<br /><br />The purpose of compare is to encourage the efficiency of growth~!
<br /><br />In that sence, we need to focus more on how to improve ourselves rather than how to win the match.
<br /><br />This the long-term vision of our lives~!
<br /><br />Even through you are trying to reach the top position, but how many persent of confidence you can say that you have that ability to keep it forever ?
<br /><br />Can you?
<br /><br />If you think so, then your life will going control of just winning.
<br /><br />Maybe you will go to look for the special methods to help you win.
<br /><br />Even you are so willing to give out the cost to win, is it means that you will win surely?
<br /><br />That is still a question, so people think carefully, what the thing behind match?<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />

Normally KPMG is an financial firm in Malaysia. But today, in order to safe space, they asked other big firms on financial and accounting ,audit to come and offered us an educational fair.  
<br /><br />First, we met each other and take the attendence in front of our college. Then when we arrived there, it considered anther big group of people. All of us were divided into many small teams. My diploma classmates and friends preferred to stay together. About three and four staffs of KPMG picked up us and guided us to walk through their working place. There were a lot of staffs there. And the envirnments there still be considered quite good as my own opinion. The only thing for me it was that the different departments were located not so clear enough. You would get a loss, if you were new comer. 
<br /><br />Before our lunch, we sitted for a presentation about Institute of Chartered Accountancy in England &amp; Wales(ICAEW), the lady said that nowadays, people in Malaysia can study ICAEW in Malaysia already. The professional body just allowed that to have a training center in Malaysia. And the passing rate of ICAEW is hight. Besides these, I can not remember other points, but sounds that it is quite benefit to study this.  After our lunch, we took the lift to the level 12, there was a really big ball room, and also a lot of pomotioners who were presenting their own company. For my memory, there were E&amp;Y, Deloitte, Hong Long Bank and so on. Most of them will question us on our education level, it made me felt that, they want new employees or staffs from college or univercity. Even like this, I felt it was a new experience for me to know more about the requirement of the updated company. Then I knew what kind of people they were looking for, and what I still need to do if I want to join these kind of firms. 
<br /><br />They required for a degree and CGPA 3.0 above. Now I was just started my degree, and my CGPA was only 2.86, so pity one I still need to put in efforts. After we visited the KPMG, the college buses came and took us back to college. So it took us about five hours there, but it was good for me. Because no matter how good or bad I am now, I would have basicly a brief idea about the working requirements, and some more details about the financial firm and their works. And really for me, I want to be work in this type of company. So this was that I thought it was valuable for today's visit.  Lucky I was here, and I took this chance~!

<br /><br />First, the numbers of labor in China is huge. The companies do not need to worry that there are not enough labor. Another word, it proves that the unemployment rate in China is high. It is so easy to get someone to work for your company, then the employers will not so willing to pay high. However, in western countries, the population is less, and a huge group of people are old people. In this case, the salaries have to pay higher, then the young people will get the job. Nobody wants to employ somebody who is always sick in the hospital, right?
<br /><br />Second, the qualities of the labor in China is not high enough normally. It is a fact that our education level still not so updated as the international one. As a labor, if you don't have high education and good woking skills and working experiences, you will find that it is also difficult to get a job which offers you a high pay. Take yourself as a master holder in UK, will you take the job which is only offer you the amount just can cover your rental? Maybe you will think in this way. It is so hard to get my master, how come I will satisfied with this kind of small offices but not the international firms? Of course, if the person is interested in that job, maybe he/she will not care how much they can gain from it. Differently, how many people can do as working for personal interested in China ? Most of us were told to study hard and get a good job which means high pay job. Seldom cases will appear that you should work for your hobbies.
<br /><br />Third, it is because some of us lack of money. We have to relize that we still have a big group of people who can not survive on their daily lives. If they are so poor that they will take the job which is just can only enough to their daily lives. But in western countries, their total national income is high and the popular is low, countries have that kind of economical funds to support the poor on their lives. It means that their social fund is helpful to their popular. Surely it can not cover all, but in that case, there will not be so many poor people as China. As a result, people there will not so necessary to get money for buying food and clothes. 
<br /><br />In a word, China have to improve a lot of things in order to increase the labor cost and also imporve the qualities of live. Otherwise, the power of the nation and the international status will also drop because of these reasons. And we will keep losing our own business market shares. As a result, we will lose our own products' values.
