Analyze the chord first <br /><br />When you learn a new barre chord don't immediately try the chord on guitar. Analyze the chord first, what strings are played in this chord, which notes are used, what position is this chord, what fingers are involved, and how the chord shape look like. Get to know all of this information that will definitely help you to learn chords faster. When you practice  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners57.wetpaint.com%2Fpage%2FTwo%2BEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2BTo%2BKnow%2B%252859%2529"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners57.wetpaint.com/page/Two+Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+To+Know+%2859%29</a> ,    you don't only learn how you should frets on the fingerboard you need to know all information above. Then you won't get stock when you play chords, it will become a natural move when you play chord changes.<br /><br />2. Use the weight of your arm <br /><br />A lot of people quit guitar because of the barre chords. Barre chords are difficult to many beginners. Because it's very hard to get all strings sound and it hurts fingers if you don't know how to play correctly. Beginners often start to learn F chord as the first barre chord. And they often can get all strings to sing. And their fingers are getting sore after few tries. And their arms are in great tension, they soon feel their arms are tired.<br /><br />Actually, to fret the barred chord correctly you need to apply for the weight of your arm instead of adding strength to your hands and fingers. Due to the earth attraction, if you lift your arm in air and release the strength to hold it, it will fall naturally. Because your arm has weight, so we need to take the advantage of this natural science. You can just add a little strength to your hand which just enough to make your hand hang on strings. Then you apply for the weight of your arm to press the strings. If you are still having trouble with it you can adjust the guitar, let the fingerboard face up a little bit instead of facing to the front of you. So your left hand will have an angle with the fingerboard which is easier to hang your left hand on strings.<br /><br />3. Don't fret the strings you don't need to <br /><br />Another mistake beginners usually make is when they play a barre chord they try very hard to press every string to make sure they will make sound. This is a big energy waste of you. You don't need to press every string to make the chord sound clear. For example, if you play a Bm chord, you don't need to play the sixth string of your guitar. So your left hand doesn't need to fret the sixth string, your index finger just need to fret from first string to fifth string. Another tip is when you play a barre chord your index finger doesn't need to press all strings with your strength. Like the Bm chord again, the second, third and fourth strings are played by middle, pinky and ring fingers, only the first and fifth string is played by index finger. You will enjoy more than suffering from learning how to play  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners79.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F10%2F09%2Ftwo-easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-to-know%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners79.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/two-easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-to-know/</a> ,

If your answer is yes then you're in luck as learning guitar chords for beginners is not that difficult.<br /><br />I've been playing guitar for the past 30 years and although technology has made it easy to watch online guitar lessons, it's up to you to put in the time to learn the chords as well as the music theory behind the chords if you wish.<br /><br />For this article, we will be focusing on the D chord as well as some other  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners30.wikispaces.com%2FTwo%2BEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2BTo%2BKnow"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners30.wikispaces.com/Two+Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+To+Know</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners57.wetpaint.com%2Fpage%2FTwo%2BEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2BTo%2BKnow%2B%252859%2529"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners57.wetpaint.com/page/Two+Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+To+Know+%2859%29</a>  that will help form the foundation of many of the songs that you will end up playing.<br /><br />Your guitar has 6 strings on it and is normally tuned to the following notes: E, A, D, G, B, E <br /><br />There are also guitar tabs that can help you learn to play beginner chords. For reference they number the strings as well as show you where your fingers should be placed to form the chord.<br /><br />The guitar strings are normally numbered from highest to lowest meaning the last string on your guitar (the high E string) is know as the #1 string. So the numbering orders is as follows:<br /><br />#6 - E (low) <br />#5 = A <br />#4 = D <br />#3 = G <br />#2 = B <br />#1 = E (high) <br /><br />So without going into too much detail regarding music theory for now, some of the most common  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners30.wikispaces.com%2FTwo%2BEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2BTo%2BKnow"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners30.wikispaces.com/Two+Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+To+Know</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/andywitt11</a>  are known as &quot;open chords&quot; because of their fingering style. When it comes to playing the D chord, the most common way to play it is as follows:<br /><br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #3 (G) on the second fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #1 (E high) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the third fret.<br /><br />Congratulations! You just played an open D chord. You may want to work on bending your fingers, especially your ring finger, so that the tips of all of your fingers press firmly down onto the fret board to make the chord sound clean when you strum it. When it comes to guitar chords for beginners, if you practice and have some patience, you will see results come very quickly!<br /><br />The D chord has a really nice and bright sound to it. Learn to play this chord well and you will be on your way to many well known songs that start off with this chord (i.e. Sweet Home Alabama).<br /><br />Here's a few extra tips on the D chord that will have you sounding like a pro in no time.<br /><br />Tip #1 - Play the D chord and while strumming or picking, place your little finger (pinky) on string #1 (E) on the third fret and then take it off again. Sounds cool doesn't it! You are playing what is called a D Sus (Sus = suspended) chord when you add your little finger to the mix.<br />Tip #2 - Play the D chord and this time remove your middle finger from string #1 (E) on the second fret and strum a few times and then put it back on again. When you remove your finger you are now playing what is known as a D5 chord.

Just for review, if you are a beginner, here is the basic layout of the guitar.<br /><br />Every standard guitar has six strings on it and they are tuned usually (or standard tuning) to the corresponding notes: E, A, D, G, B, E<br /><br />Along with normal music notation, you can also use a numbering system known as guitar tabs that will assist you in seeing the finger placements for your chords.<br /><br />Each guitar string has a number associated with it beginning from the highest sounding string to lowest. The high E string is normally recognized as the #1 string. So the order of string numbers looks like this:<br /><br />#1 = E (high), #2 = B, #3 = G, #4 = D, #5 = A, #6 - E (low)<br /><br />Now that we've got our string numbers dialed in, let's start working on playing our open C chord. Here is the most common way to play this chord.<br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the first fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #4 (D) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #5 (A) on the third fret.<br /><br />With all three fingers in place, give your guitar a strum. Congratulations! You're playing an open C chord.<br />It may take a little bending from your fingers to make the curl around the neck of the guitar but keep working on it and you will find it getting easier and easier.<br /><br />The open C chord is one of the great  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thoughts.com%2Fandywitt11%2Feasy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-finger-and-play-guitar"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.thoughts.com/andywitt11/easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-finger-and-play-guitar</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners38.wikispaces.com%2FEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2B-%2BPoint%2Ba%2BFinger%2Band%2BPlay%2BGuitar"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners38.wikispaces.com/Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+-+Point+a+Finger+and+Play+Guitar</a>  because it has such a warm and rich sound. Many songs begin with this chord (i.e. Dust In The Wind) so if you continue to practice playing it, you will have a great starting point to launch into other chords that are right near by.<br />Here are some bonus tips on playing the C chord that will have you impressing all of your friends!<br /><br />Tip #1 - Start by playing the C chord and then remove your ring finger from the 5th string. You are now playing an A minor 7 chord that makes the sound more haunting and moody. Go back to playing the full C chord and you will notice the sound becoming brighter again. It's a nice contrast.<br />Tip #2 - Start by playing the C chord and this time take your pinky finger and place in on string #4 (G) on the third fret right next to your ring finger. It makes the chord sound a bit higher as you have just played a C sus (suspended) chord. Now take your pinky finger off and you will be playing the C chord again.<br /><br />Practicing those fingering moves from the C chord to the Am7 chord to the Csus chord will allow to begin to build a great foundation of chords to work with. As with any  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners38.wikispaces.com%2FEasy%2BGuitar%2BChords%2BFor%2BBeginners%2B-%2BPoint%2Ba%2BFinger%2Band%2BPlay%2BGuitar"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners38.wikispaces.com/Easy+Guitar+Chords+For+Beginners+-+Point+a+Finger+and+Play+Guitar</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.livejournal.com%2F950.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.livejournal.com/950.html</a> , practice will make you a much stronger player.

The different chord formations will come in handy when you are looking for the simpler way to change chords.<br /><br />2. Getting into the right finger positions<br />Are you having a hard time getting your fingers in the right position while changing chords? Many beginners feel the strain of playing difficult chords especially with the ring and last finger. It is important to play in a comfortable position, relax your wrist and fingers. Place your index finger correctly so that the rest of the fingers will rest on the fretboard.<br />If you feel uncomfortable or painful while forming the chord, readjust the position of your fingers. Stretching exercises are essential for beginners as they will build the strength and agility of the fingers in order to switch between chords.<br /><br />3. Changing chords<br />Changing chords can be really hard for   ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners21.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F10%2F09%2Feasy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-finger-and-play-guitar%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://guitarchordsforbeginners21.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-finger-and-play-guitar/</a> . Chord progressions are usually chords played in a repeating sequence within a music composition or song. Hence, the best way of learning is by playing songs.<br />For easy reference, you can put together the chords of a song into a chart. Some websites enable you to customize the chart by selecting diagrams of specific chords and print it out. Start by playing the entire song slowly then build up speed to the original tempo when you are able to change the chords smoothly. Trying to rush a change makes it harder to get your fingers into position for the next chord.<br /><br />As there are different variations for forming each chord, apply the most appropriate shape to the progression, that is to take the shortest route to move from one to another. For example, if you are changing from E to B major, it is easier to play both from the seventh fret rather than rushing from the seventh fret to the second.<br /><br />4. Remembering chords<br /><br />The inability to remember chords is the reason why you are unable to change them smoothly. The best way to memorize chords is to practice with your eyes closed. Alternatively, you can keep playing the same progression while watching your favorite television programme. This will take your eyes off the fretboard.<br />As you repeat the same finger pattern over time, a long-term memory is created for it. You will eventually form it naturally without conscious effort.<br /><br />5. How To Practice Effectively<br /><br />The keys to effective practice is consistency and repetition. Daily practice of ten minutes is better than weekly session of eight hours. Short sessions make it easier for beginners to focus on perfecting chord formations and help to get over the soreness on your fingers.<br /><br />Concentrate on a chord or progression for each session instead of learning different patterns back to back as it may cause forgetting of the initial one. Then repeat the finger pattern till you master it. Repetition enables you to remember the movement that will become automatic and improve with practice.

The objective of this article is to share what those beginner guitar chords are and the best way is always to perform them.<br /><br />At some point its possible you have heard other people mention open, bar and power chords.<br /><br />These are generally simply names for many various approaches you can utilize to perform chords when playing your guitar.<br /><br />Bar chords are definitely more of an intermediate level chord to play therefore i won't be talking about them in this article.<br /><br />The best  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2Fguitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/guitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords</a>  are the open chords and the power chords although these are used in various ways.<br /><br />An open chord is exactly what I'd personally describe as a complete sounding chord, once you play it you are going to perceive an entire array of notes and sounds great when strummed by using an acoustic or even classical guitar. It is played down the end of the guitar's fretboard towards the headstock end and you will very rarely went beyond the 3rd or 4th when fretting them.<br />The power chord on the other hand can be used more commonly in rock and metal styles of guitar playing and sounds best played out on electric guitar with a distortion function on the amplifier. This chord consists of only two notes in comparison to open chords which can be made up of up to six notes. Because it just has two notes, it sounds simple and impressive on electric guitar whereas anymore notes might sound 'mushy' through the distortion setting.<br /><br />To perform a power chord, you are emphasizing merely playing two notes across two guitar strings. Position your index finger on the 5th fret of the lower, fat E string and put your third finger onto the seventh fret of the A string. Your fingers have finally made the power chord 'shape' which is as follows: your third finger is constantly two frets higher and on the neighboring string in accordance with your index finger.<br /><br />On this certain situation, you have just fretted an 'A' power chord also written in music as 'A5?. It's an A power chord because your index finger is fretting an A note. In the event you alter this 'shape' all the way to the headstock so that your index finger is currently on the third fret of the lower, fat E string as well as your third finger is on the fifth fret on the A string, you are now fretting a G power chord also called G5.<br /><br />Proceed to focus on simply strumming the lower sounding two string on the guitar (E and A string) and also try to avoid allow any other guitar strings produce a sound. Attempt changing the power chord shape towards an alternative spot on the guitar neck and play once again.<br /><br />Great job, we have just learned the basics of our very first set of  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2Fguitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/guitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/</a> , the power chord.

So the numbering orders is as follows:<br /><br />#6 - E (low) <br />#5 = A <br />#4 = D <br />#3 = G <br />#2 = B <br />#1 = E (high) <br /><br />So without going into too much detail regarding music theory for now, some of the most common  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%253ac5eb47b0-7527-42fc-b864-2830ac0b4ea4%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%3ac5eb47b0-7527-42fc-b864-2830ac0b4ea4&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fguitarchordsforbeginnerwww."target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/guitarchordsforbeginnerwww.</a>  are known as &quot;open chords&quot; because of their fingering style. When it comes to playing the D chord, the most common way to play it is as follows:<br /><br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #3 (G) on the second fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #1 (E high) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the third fret.<br /><br />Congratulations! You just played an open D chord. You may want to work on bending your fingers, especially your ring finger, so that the tips of all of your fingers press firmly down onto the fret board to make the chord sound clean when you strum it. When it comes to guitar chords for beginners, if you practice and have some patience, you will see results come very quickly!<br /><br />The D chord has a really nice and bright sound to it. Learn to play this chord well and you will be on your way to many well known songs that start off with this chord (i.e. Sweet Home Alabama).<br /><br />Here's a few extra tips on the D chord that will have you sounding like a pro in no time.<br /><br />Tip #1 - Play the D chord and while strumming or picking, place your little finger (pinky) on string #1 (E) on the third fret and then take it off again. Sounds cool doesn't it! You are playing what is called a D Sus (Sus = suspended) chord when you add your little finger to the mix.<br />Tip #2 - Play the D chord and this time remove your middle finger from string #1 (E) on the second fret and strum a few times and then put it back on again. When you remove your finger you are now playing what is known as a D5 chord.

That's a simplified G chord.<br /><br />Okay, I see I'm going to have to explain a few basics on the guitar. Firstly, the strings on a guitar are numbered one to six, and the first string is the thinnest string and has the highest pitch. I sometimes catch myself getting this wrong, and assuming that the thickest string is the first one. It's a natural mistake.<br /><br />The second thing is the finger numbering, which is quite logical, seeing as your index finger is the first finger, seeing as that's the one you point with.<br /><br />The second, third and fourth finger are the rest in logical sequence.<br /><br />Frets are the metal bars in the fretboard behind which you place your fingers. The frets are numbered from the nut, so the nut of the guitar is basically zero. A long time ago, some guitars had a nut, and then immediately after there was a zero fret that the strings rested on.<br />Anyway, I'm sure you get the idea.<br /><br />For this version of the G chord, the reason why I chose to use the third finger is because later, when you play the full G chord, your first and second fingers get used.If you place your first finger on the first fret of the first string, and play the first four strings, you've got a G7 chord.<br />The simplified C chord on guitar.<br /><br />For this chord you place your first finger on the second string behind the first fret. Here you only strum the first three strings.<br /><br />So far, those are the simplest guitar chords I can come up with using standard tuning on the guitar. For small children just getting the hang of playing the guitar, these are an easy starting point.<br /><br />The C and G guitar chords go very well together, but are only suited to a two chord song on the guitar. It's a bit limiting. To really learn to play the guitar, a beginner would have to start with the open chords, which are still fairly easy to play.<br /><br />Open chords are called open because they are all played within the first three fret spaces of the guitar, and use some notes from the open unfretted strings.<br /><br />The open chords you'll begin with.<br /><br />The most common guitar chords for beginners are the major and minor open chords. For the major chords there is A, C, D, E and G.<br /><br />For the minor  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2Fguitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/guitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords</a>  you've got A minor (a small m is the usual suffix for minor chords, so this would be written Am) then Dm and Em. This is a lot better than the one finger chords, but as you can see from the list, there is a lot more needed to be able to play any song you want.<br /><br />On the positive side, the open chords are the building blocks for more complex and difficult  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2Fguitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/guitar-chords-for-beginners-how-to-play-3-easy-chords</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarchordsforbeginnerstips.com/</a>  on the guitar, and even though there are some chords missing, by changing the key of some songs, you could easily build a fairly large repertoire of songs to play with open chords.

Just for review, if you are a beginner, here is the basic layout of the guitar.<br /><br />Every standard guitar has six strings on it and they are tuned usually (or standard tuning) to the corresponding notes: E, A, D, G, B, E<br /><br />Along with normal music notation, you can also use a numbering system known as guitar tabs that will assist you in seeing the finger placements for your chords.<br /><br />Each guitar string has a number associated with it beginning from the highest sounding string to lowest. The high E string is normally recognized as the #1 string. So the order of string numbers looks like this:<br /><br />#1 = E (high), #2 = B, #3 = G, #4 = D, #5 = A, #6 - E (low)<br /><br />Now that we've got our string numbers dialed in, let's start working on playing our open C chord. Here is the most common way to play this chord.<br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the first fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #4 (D) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #5 (A) on the third fret.<br /><br />With all three fingers in place, give your guitar a strum. Congratulations! You're playing an open C chord.<br />It may take a little bending from your fingers to make the curl around the neck of the guitar but keep working on it and you will find it getting easier and easier.<br /><br />The open C chord is one of the great  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners76"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/guitarchordsforbeginners76</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%253ade5789aa-59cc-443a-a751-6d78c698dd12%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%3ade5789aa-59cc-443a-a751-6d78c698dd12&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a>  because it has such a warm and rich sound. Many songs begin with this chord (i.e. Dust In The Wind) so if you continue to practice playing it, you will have a great starting point to launch into other chords that are right near by.<br />Here are some bonus tips on playing the C chord that will have you impressing all of your friends!<br /><br />Tip #1 - Start by playing the C chord and then remove your ring finger from the 5th string. You are now playing an A minor 7 chord that makes the sound more haunting and moody. Go back to playing the full C chord and you will notice the sound becoming brighter again. It's a nice contrast.<br />Tip #2 - Start by playing the C chord and this time take your pinky finger and place in on string #4 (G) on the third fret right next to your ring finger. It makes the chord sound a bit higher as you have just played a C sus (suspended) chord. Now take your pinky finger off and you will be playing the C chord again.<br /><br />Practicing those fingering moves from the C chord to the Am7 chord to the Csus chord will allow to begin to build a great foundation of chords to work with.

This article provides helpful tips for beginners who want to learn guitar chords successfully.<br /><br />5 Tips to learn guitar chords for beginners:<br /><br />1. Getting a guitar chord book<br />Every aspiring guitarist needs a good chord book for easy reference and learning. The book teaches you all the common types of chords and progressions that you need to know. You do not have to waste time finding out what is the order of chords to learn. The chords are presented with common diagrams accompanied with real-life photos so that you can see clearly where to place your fingers on the fretboard.<br /><br />The better books will display each chord with different variations and different progressions for you to explore alternative ways of playing. The different chord formations will come in handy when you are looking for the simpler way to change chords.<br /><br />2. Getting into the right finger positions<br />Are you having a hard time getting your fingers in the right position while changing chords? Many beginners feel the strain of playing difficult chords especially with the ring and last finger. It is important to play in a comfortable position, relax your wrist and fingers. Place your index finger correctly so that the rest of the fingers will rest on the fretboard.<br />If you feel uncomfortable or painful while forming the chord, readjust the position of your fingers. Stretching exercises are essential for beginners as they will build the strength and agility of the fingers in order to switch between chords.<br /><br />3. Changing chords<br />Changing chords can be really hard for  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Fsection%3Fcategory%3DPluckPersona%26amp%3BU%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPersonaPage%3DBlogViewPost%26amp%3BplckUserId%3D78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb%26amp%3BplckPostId%3DBlog%253a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%253ade5789aa-59cc-443a-a751-6d78c698dd12%26amp%3BplckBlogItemsPerPage%3D5"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=PluckPersona&amp;U=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPersonaPage=BlogViewPost&amp;plckUserId=78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfb&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3a78ec884a1ead4775a4e4bc1b4f4b1bfbPost%3ade5789aa-59cc-443a-a751-6d78c698dd12&amp;plckBlogItemsPerPage=5</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fguitarchordsforbeginners76"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/guitarchordsforbeginners76</a> . Chord progressions are usually chords played in a repeating sequence within a music composition or song. Hence, the best way of learning is by playing songs.<br />For easy reference, you can put together the chords of a song into a chart. Some websites enable you to customize the chart by selecting diagrams of specific chords and print it out. Start by playing the entire song slowly then build up speed to the original tempo when you are able to change the chords smoothly. Trying to rush a change makes it harder to get your fingers into position for the next chord.<br /><br />As there are different variations for forming each chord, apply the most appropriate shape to the progression, that is to take the shortest route to move from one to another. For example, if you are changing from E to B major, it is easier to play both from the seventh fret rather than rushing from the seventh fret to the second.<br /><br />4. Remembering chords<br /><br />The inability to remember chords is the reason why you are unable to change them smoothly. The best way to memorize chords is to practice with your eyes closed. Alternatively, you can keep playing the same progression while watching your favorite television programme. This will take your eyes off the fretboard.<br />As you repeat the same finger pattern over time, a long-term memory is created for it. You will eventually form it naturally without conscious effort.<br /><br />5. How To Practice Effectively<br /><br />The keys to effective practice is consistency and repetition.

Analyze the chord first <br /><br />When you learn a new barre chord don't immediately try the chord on guitar. Analyze the chord first, what strings are played in this chord, which notes are used, what position is this chord, what fingers are involved, and how the chord shape look like. Get to know all of this information that will definitely help you to learn chords faster. When you practice  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.posterous.com%2Ftwo-easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-to-know"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.posterous.com/two-easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-to-know</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.atom.com%2FPost%2FTwo-Easy-Guitar-Chords-For-Beginners-To-Know%2F03EFBFFFF024B24870008016594E1"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://community.atom.com/Post/Two-Easy-Guitar-Chords-For-Beginners-To-Know/03EFBFFFF024B24870008016594E1</a>  you don't only learn how you should frets on the fingerboard you need to know all information above. Then you won't get stock when you play chords, it will become a natural move when you play chord changes.<br /><br />2. Use the weight of your arm <br /><br />A lot of people quit guitar because of the barre chords. Barre chords are difficult to many beginners. Because it's very hard to get all strings sound and it hurts fingers if you don't know how to play correctly. Beginners often start to learn F chord as the first barre chord. And they often can get all strings to sing. And their fingers are getting sore after few tries. And their arms are in great tension, they soon feel their arms are tired.<br /><br />Actually, to fret the barred chord correctly you need to apply for the weight of your arm instead of adding strength to your hands and fingers. Due to the earth attraction, if you lift your arm in air and release the strength to hold it, it will fall naturally. Because your arm has weight, so we need to take the advantage of this natural science. You can just add a little strength to your hand which just enough to make your hand hang on strings. Then you apply for the weight of your arm to press the strings. If you are still having trouble with it you can adjust the guitar, let the fingerboard face up a little bit instead of facing to the front of you. So your left hand will have an angle with the fingerboard which is easier to hang your left hand on strings.<br /><br />3. Don't fret the strings you don't need to <br /><br />Another mistake beginners usually make is when they play a barre chord they try very hard to press every string to make sure they will make sound. This is a big energy waste of you. You don't need to press every string to make the chord sound clear. For example, if you play a Bm chord, you don't need to play the sixth string of your guitar. So your left hand doesn't need to fret the sixth string, your index finger just need to fret from first string to fifth string. Another tip is when you play a barre chord your index finger doesn't need to press all strings with your strength. Like the Bm chord again, the second, third and fourth strings are played by middle, pinky and ring fingers, only the first and fifth string is played by index finger. You will enjoy more than suffering from learning how to play  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.whatsblog.net%2FThe-first-blog-b1%2FTwo-Easy-Guitar-Chords-For-Beginners-To-Know-b1-p10.htm"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.whatsblog.net/The-first-blog-b1/Two-Easy-Guitar-Chords-For-Beginners-To-Know-b1-p10.htm</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwallinside.com%2Fpost-373571.html"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://wallinside.com/post-373571.html</a>

Learn to play this chord well and you will be on your way to many well known songs that start off with this chord (i.e. Sweet Home Alabama).<br /><br />Here's a few extra tips on the D chord that will have you sounding like a pro in no time.<br /><br />Tip #1 - Play the D chord and while strumming or picking, place your little finger (pinky) on string #1 (E) on the third fret and then take it off again. Sounds cool doesn't it! You are playing what is called a D Sus (Sus = suspended) chord when you add your little finger to the mix.<br />Tip #2 - Play the D chord and this time remove your middle finger from string #1 (E) on the second fret and strum a few times and then put it back on again. When you remove your finger you are now playing what is known as a D5 chord.

Getting a guitar chord book<br />Every aspiring guitarist needs a good chord book for easy reference and learning. The book teaches you all the common types of chords and progressions that you need to know. You do not have to waste time finding out what is the order of chords to learn. The chords are presented with common diagrams accompanied with real-life photos so that you can see clearly where to place your fingers on the fretboard.<br /><br />The better books will display each chord with different variations and different progressions for you to explore alternative ways of playing. The different chord formations will come in handy when you are looking for the simpler way to change chords.<br /><br />2. Getting into the right finger positions<br />Are you having a hard time getting your fingers in the right position while changing chords? Many beginners feel the strain of playing difficult chords especially with the ring and last finger. It is important to play in a comfortable position, relax your wrist and fingers. Place your index finger correctly so that the rest of the fingers will rest on the fretboard.<br />If you feel uncomfortable or painful while forming the chord, readjust the position of your fingers. Stretching exercises are essential for beginners as they will build the strength and agility of the fingers in order to switch between chords.<br /><br />3. Changing chords<br />Changing chords can be really hard for  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.posterous.com%2Feasy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-fing"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.posterous.com/easy-guitar-chords-for-beginners-point-a-fing</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.getjealous.com%2Fblog.php%3Faction%3Dshowdiaryentry%26amp%3Bdiary_id%3D2210582%26amp%3Bgo%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.getjealous.com/blog.php?action=showdiaryentry&amp;diary_id=2210582&amp;go=andywitt11</a> . Chord progressions are usually chords played in a repeating sequence within a music composition or song. Hence, the best way of learning is by playing songs.<br />For easy reference, you can put together the chords of a song into a chart. Some websites enable you to customize the chart by selecting diagrams of specific chords and print it out. Start by playing the entire song slowly then build up speed to the original tempo when you are able to change the chords smoothly. Trying to rush a change makes it harder to get your fingers into position for the next chord.<br /><br />As there are different variations for forming each chord, apply the most appropriate shape to the progression, that is to take the shortest route to move from one to another. For example, if you are changing from E to B major, it is easier to play both from the seventh fret rather than rushing from the seventh fret to the second.<br /><br />4. Remembering chords<br /><br />The inability to remember chords is the reason why you are unable to change them smoothly. The best way to memorize chords is to practice with your eyes closed. Alternatively, you can keep playing the same progression while watching your favorite television programme. This will take your eyes off the fretboard.<br />As you repeat the same finger pattern over time, a long-term memory is created for it. You will eventually form it naturally without conscious effort.<br /><br />5. How To Practice Effectively<br /><br />The keys to effective practice is consistency and repetition. Daily practice of ten minutes is better than weekly session of eight hours.

Analyze the chord first, what strings are played in this chord, which notes are used, what position is this chord, what fingers are involved, and how the chord shape look like. Get to know all of this information that will definitely help you to learn chords faster. When you practice  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asianave.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D5753263%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D45107577%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D45107577%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianave.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=5753263&amp;profile_id=45107577&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=45107577&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.friendsreunited.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fread%2F719788381%2F182449"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk/blog/read/719788381/182449</a>  you don't only learn how you should frets on the fingerboard you need to know all information above. Then you won't get stock when you play chords, it will become a natural move when you play chord changes.<br /><br />2. Use the weight of your arm <br /><br />A lot of people quit guitar because of the barre chords. Barre chords are difficult to many beginners. Because it's very hard to get all strings sound and it hurts fingers if you don't know how to play correctly. Beginners often start to learn F chord as the first barre chord. And they often can get all strings to sing. And their fingers are getting sore after few tries. And their arms are in great tension, they soon feel their arms are tired.<br /><br />Actually, to fret the barred chord correctly you need to apply for the weight of your arm instead of adding strength to your hands and fingers. Due to the earth attraction, if you lift your arm in air and release the strength to hold it, it will fall naturally. Because your arm has weight, so we need to take the advantage of this natural science. You can just add a little strength to your hand which just enough to make your hand hang on strings. Then you apply for the weight of your arm to press the strings. If you are still having trouble with it you can adjust the guitar, let the fingerboard face up a little bit instead of facing to the front of you. So your left hand will have an angle with the fingerboard which is easier to hang your left hand on strings.<br /><br />3. Don't fret the strings you don't need to <br /><br />Another mistake beginners usually make is when they play a barre chord they try very hard to press every string to make sure they will make sound. This is a big energy waste of you. You don't need to press every string to make the chord sound clear. For example, if you play a Bm chord, you don't need to play the sixth string of your guitar. So your left hand doesn't need to fret the sixth string, your index finger just need to fret from first string to fifth string. Another tip is when you play a barre chord your index finger doesn't need to press all strings with your strength. Like the Bm chord again, the second, third and fourth strings are played by middle, pinky and ring fingers, only the first and fifth string is played by index finger. So you only need to add strength on the parts of your index finger which you press the first and fifth strings.<br /><br />These tips can help you to save your time and avoid frustrations as a beginner.

Many beginners feel the strain of playing difficult chords especially with the ring and last finger. It is important to play in a comfortable position, relax your wrist and fingers.

Chord progressions are usually chords played in a repeating sequence within a music composition or song. Hence, the best way of learning is by playing songs.<br />For easy reference, you can put together the chords of a song into a chart. Some websites enable you to customize the chart by selecting diagrams of specific chords and print it out. Start by playing the entire song slowly then build up speed to the original tempo when you are able to change the chords smoothly. Trying to rush a change makes it harder to get your fingers into position for the next chord.<br /><br />As there are different variations for forming each chord, apply the most appropriate shape to the progression, that is to take the shortest route to move from one to another. For example, if you are changing from E to B major, it is easier to play both from the seventh fret rather than rushing from the seventh fret to the second.<br /><br />4. Remembering chords<br /><br />The inability to remember chords is the reason why you are unable to change them smoothly. The best way to memorize chords is to practice with your eyes closed. Alternatively, you can keep playing the same progression while watching your favorite television programme. This will take your eyes off the fretboard.<br />As you repeat the same finger pattern over time, a long-term memory is created for it. You will eventually form it naturally without conscious effort.<br /><br />5. How To Practice Effectively<br /><br />The keys to effective practice is consistency and repetition. Daily practice of ten minutes is better than weekly session of eight hours. Short sessions make it easier for beginners to focus on perfecting chord formations and help to get over the soreness on your fingers.<br /><br />Concentrate on a chord or progression for each session instead of learning different patterns back to back as it may cause forgetting of the initial one. Then repeat the finger pattern till you master it. Repetition enables you to remember the movement that will become automatic and improve with practice.

Get to know all of this information that will definitely help you to learn chords faster. When you practice  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155405%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155405&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.deviantart.com%2Fjournal%2F45032715%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.deviantart.com/journal/45032715/</a>  you don't only learn how you should frets on the fingerboard you need to know all information above. Then you won't get stock when you play chords, it will become a natural move when you play chord changes.<br /><br />2. Use the weight of your arm <br /><br />A lot of people quit guitar because of the barre chords. Barre chords are difficult to many beginners. Because it's very hard to get all strings sound and it hurts fingers if you don't know how to play correctly. Beginners often start to learn F chord as the first barre chord. And they often can get all strings to sing. And their fingers are getting sore after few tries. And their arms are in great tension, they soon feel their arms are tired.<br /><br />Actually, to fret the barred chord correctly you need to apply for the weight of your arm instead of adding strength to your hands and fingers. Due to the earth attraction, if you lift your arm in air and release the strength to hold it, it will fall naturally. Because your arm has weight, so we need to take the advantage of this natural science. You can just add a little strength to your hand which just enough to make your hand hang on strings. Then you apply for the weight of your arm to press the strings. If you are still having trouble with it you can adjust the guitar, let the fingerboard face up a little bit instead of facing to the front of you. So your left hand will have an angle with the fingerboard which is easier to hang your left hand on strings.<br /><br />3. Don't fret the strings you don't need to <br /><br />Another mistake beginners usually make is when they play a barre chord they try very hard to press every string to make sure they will make sound. This is a big energy waste of you. You don't need to press every string to make the chord sound clear. For example, if you play a Bm chord, you don't need to play the sixth string of your guitar. So your left hand doesn't need to fret the sixth string, your index finger just need to fret from first string to fifth string. Another tip is when you play a barre chord your index finger doesn't need to press all strings with your strength. Like the Bm chord again, the second, third and fourth strings are played by middle, pinky and ring fingers, only the first and fifth string is played by index finger. So you only need to add strength on the parts of your index finger which you press the first and fifth strings.<br /><br />These tips can help you to save your time and avoid frustrations as a beginner. You will enjoy more than suffering from learning how to play  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackplanet.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D777212%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackplanet.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=777212&amp;profile_id=59050038&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=59050038&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155405%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155405&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a>

If your answer is yes then you're in luck as learning guitar chords for beginners is not that difficult.<br /><br />I've been playing guitar for the past 30 years and although technology has made it easy to watch online guitar lessons, it's up to you to put in the time to learn the chords as well as the music theory behind the chords if you wish.<br /><br />For this article, we will be focusing on the D chord as well as some other  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackplanet.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D777212%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackplanet.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=777212&amp;profile_id=59050038&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=59050038&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155405%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155405&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a>  that will help form the foundation of many of the songs that you will end up playing.<br /><br />Your guitar has 6 strings on it and is normally tuned to the following notes: E, A, D, G, B, E <br /><br />There are also guitar tabs that can help you learn to play beginner chords. For reference they number the strings as well as show you where your fingers should be placed to form the chord.<br /><br />The guitar strings are normally numbered from highest to lowest meaning the last string on your guitar (the high E string) is know as the #1 string. So the numbering orders is as follows:<br /><br />#6 - E (low) <br />#5 = A <br />#4 = D <br />#3 = G <br />#2 = B <br />#1 = E (high) <br /><br />So without going into too much detail regarding music theory for now, some of the most common  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackplanet.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D777212%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D59050038%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackplanet.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=777212&amp;profile_id=59050038&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=59050038&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155405%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155405&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a>  are known as &quot;open chords&quot; because of their fingering style. When it comes to playing the D chord, the most common way to play it is as follows:<br /><br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #3 (G) on the second fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #1 (E high) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the third fret.<br /><br />Congratulations! You just played an open D chord. You may want to work on bending your fingers, especially your ring finger, so that the tips of all of your fingers press firmly down onto the fret board to make the chord sound clean when you strum it. When it comes to guitar chords for beginners, if you practice and have some patience, you will see results come very quickly!<br /><br />The D chord has a really nice and bright sound to it. Learn to play this chord well and you will be on your way to many well known songs that start off with this chord (i.e. Sweet Home Alabama).<br /><br />Here's a few extra tips on the D chord that will have you sounding like a pro in no time.<br /><br />Tip #1 - Play the D chord and while strumming or picking, place your little finger (pinky) on string #1 (E) on the third fret and then take it off again. Sounds cool doesn't it! You are playing what is called a D Sus (Sus = suspended) chord when you add your little finger to the mix.<br />Tip #2 - Play the D chord and this time remove your middle finger from string #1 (E) on the second fret and strum a few times and then put it back on again. When you remove your finger you are now playing what is known as a D5 chord.

Just for review, if you are a beginner, here is the basic layout of the guitar.<br /><br />Every standard guitar has six strings on it and they are tuned usually (or standard tuning) to the corresponding notes: E, A, D, G, B, E<br /><br />Along with normal music notation, you can also use a numbering system known as guitar tabs that will assist you in seeing the finger placements for your chords.<br /><br />Each guitar string has a number associated with it beginning from the highest sounding string to lowest. The high E string is normally recognized as the #1 string. So the order of string numbers looks like this:<br /><br />#1 = E (high), #2 = B, #3 = G, #4 = D, #5 = A, #6 - E (low)<br /><br />Now that we've got our string numbers dialed in, let's start working on playing our open C chord. Here is the most common way to play this chord.<br />Step 1 - Place your first finger on string #2 (<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/cool.gif" alt=":)" /> on the first fret. <br />Step 2 - Place your middle finger on string #4 (D) on the second fret. <br />Step 3 - Place your ring finger on string #5 (A) on the third fret.<br /><br />With all three fingers in place, give your guitar a strum. Congratulations! You're playing an open C chord.<br />It may take a little bending from your fingers to make the curl around the neck of the guitar but keep working on it and you will find it getting easier and easier.<br /><br />The open C chord is one of the great  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155411%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155411&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.deviantart.com%2Fjournal%2F45032733%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.deviantart.com/journal/45032733/</a>  because it has such a warm and rich sound. Many songs begin with this chord (i.e. Dust In The Wind) so if you continue to practice playing it, you will have a great starting point to launch into other chords that are right near by.<br />Here are some bonus tips on playing the C chord that will have you impressing all of your friends!<br /><br />Tip #1 - Start by playing the C chord and then remove your ring finger from the 5th string. You are now playing an A minor 7 chord that makes the sound more haunting and moody. Go back to playing the full C chord and you will notice the sound becoming brighter again. It's a nice contrast.<br />Tip #2 - Start by playing the C chord and this time take your pinky finger and place in on string #4 (G) on the third fret right next to your ring finger. It makes the chord sound a bit higher as you have just played a C sus (suspended) chord. Now take your pinky finger off and you will be playing the C chord again.<br /><br />Practicing those fingering moves from the C chord to the Am7 chord to the Csus chord will allow to begin to build a great foundation of chords to work with. As with any  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.migente.com%2Fyour_page%2Fblog%2Fview_posting.html%3Fpid%3D1155411%26amp%3Bprofile_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Bprofile_name%3Dandywitt11%26amp%3Buser_id%3D6600537%26amp%3Busername%3Dandywitt11"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.migente.com/your_page/blog/view_posting.html?pid=1155411&amp;profile_id=6600537&amp;profile_name=andywitt11&amp;user_id=6600537&amp;username=andywitt11</a> ,  <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fandywitt11.deviantart.com%2Fjournal%2F45032733%2F"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://andywitt11.deviantart.com/journal/45032733/</a> , practice will make you a much stronger player.
