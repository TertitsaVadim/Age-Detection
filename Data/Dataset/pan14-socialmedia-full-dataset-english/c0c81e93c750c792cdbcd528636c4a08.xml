<br /><br />When life is hard and nothing goes the way you want 
<br />remember you have friends who see you throught it all
<br />when life is sad and you feel all alone remember 
<br />one who loves you so .
<br />when life lookes dark and storms all round
<br />thats the time God takes your hand
<br />when dreams fade away like always do 
<br />remember this my friend i stand by you
<br />When the sun wont shine and the dark is darker then
<br />the first day of your life remember this my friend all the colors
<br />soon well come into play just to see you throught your day
<br />and when the pray you prayed doesnt feel answered then remember
<br />this God doesnt foget what you said just at the time was helping 
<br />someone else but well get back to you in time.
<br />When tears fill your eyes remember this my friend we all need to cry
<br />When all feels lost and cant be find just always turn around 
<br />look down the road you came and see how far you have come
<br />never think giveing up or giveing in is easy 
<br />when the world lookes bigger then you are
<br />know your strenght and faith comes from within 
<br />your the one who is always special no matter the cost
<br />your the best throught it all .

<br />The rollercaster ride goes fast and i feel alot of times im the one you leave behind ,trying everything to make you happy but most the time im the one whoes 
<br />crying out why and what did i do wrong and how much more do i have to do to make it better when i cant even find the ground to stand on .
<br />When a man says its him and not you you know hes walking away from you and everything you build together well be at your feet soon .
<br />Sometimes you want to give up and walk away but your heart makes you stay maybe a part of you thinks hes going throught a life change or something you dont understand but you do your best to try and help but the wall stands in your way and the tears you have cryed feels so vain now like your just hitting the wall 
<br />over and over again but the true is you do what you need to get by but you still ask your self after 4 yrs of going throught this is it right or wrong and who really knows the answers when they shut you out like you arent there .

<br />alot of us find ourselfves asking questions 
<br />but never getting the answers we seek 
<br />but the jounry there life may be short and sweet 
<br />at times but sometimes harder then nails but
<br />we travel throught it with salt to light the taste of it
<br />and water to fill the soul to left our lives with the nature
<br />God does hold and the beauity we seek to find 
<br />but as we travel throught to the other side we know 
<br />wisdom and truth well follow us throught  and dreams 
<br />dont die they sometimes become our life or our nightmares
<br />what ever we make we most live with in our furtures and forget the
<br />past and make a brighter tomorrow for our children and ourselves
<br />but the road feels long without a breath we are gone and have
<br />just our children to carrry on and the life we had is no more that 
<br />we know but just a dream in some fantsy book but Only God knows the true
<br />and pulls us up throught the dust and mud and stands there looking
<br />at this lost soul hes find along the way and the road he walked years before
<br />us well be the stenght we need to carry on .

<br />with hot touches on the skin and the moves our bodys make
<br />we reach out for more kisses hugs and rolling around under the 
<br />clovers .As your hands touch down my back and the feel burns throught my
<br />soul i know i well never be along as the night was like a smell of the sweetest
<br />rose and the taste on my lips give me nothing to say but to pull
<br />your body close to mine and pull you deep into me until the air is thin
<br />and my head is light with the passion we share and the joy of the touch 
<br />moves me so much your body makes me melt into you like i find a place to hide
<br />wrap up tight with you and the sounds of music play around us like we are never apart
<br />again you pull me deep to you with a warm kiss on my lips  and throught
<br />our sweat the sweet taste of love still remains

<br />As the candle burned the shadows grew on the wall 
<br />As the rose pethels fall off the bed
<br />As the night slowly came to play
<br /><br />As the passion of love toke over them
<br />laying in sweat ,passion .
<br />her body so close to him 
<br />nothing could pull them apart
<br /><br />As his finger followed her body
<br />As her skin loved the touch
<br />kissing down her back 
<br />down her body 
<br />give her nothing to fear
<br /><br />His love for her was so real
<br />his passion so intence
<br />his eyes burning into her very soul
<br /><br />his life would never be the same 
<br />for her body she give ,everything inside of her
<br />came out true as her words .
<br />i well always love you dear .

<br />stayed the same never changeing the inside of me the young girl with all her faith and love and who cared about the little things became the woman i am today .With all the dreams i dreamed and love and trust throught out the years just make me wiser and know the humon touch that llast as long as we are here then gone with tears but we learn each day how to go strong with it all and never forgetting what we learn along the way just keeping it in our heart to remind us how to make it throught this world .
<br />Grandfather a wise old man use to say when the sky lights with thunder and lighting that is when God was 
<br />raceing his horse throught heaven and lighting the night throught it all but i use to think he was cleaning house and drop his couches along the way but its funny as a child what we think because when we are 
<br />grow we know not to be scared of the thunder and lighing along the way we know God made it and 
<br />its his way of makeing sound so we know hes still here and i know life is always changeing some for
<br />the good and some for the bad but maney times we forget who made this world for us and all the great things he give us to but in our time of need we are on our knees asking God to save us please and 
<br />he knows thats not the only time we need him so .
<br />I know maney never change like the weather and so are like dr jerkerl and mr hide but some are like mother nature and good to the end but we change because things that happen to us not because 
<br />we are bad but because something hurt or made us laught that makes a change in us .
<br />Being humon dont mean we dont feel the pain of others but know it all around us and share it alot of times
<br />but in our own way and like the thunder and lighting we had to make a sound and show it right out loud 
<br />we are beauity within and colors and great humons on this world to day .

<br />was as peace with the world .
<br />As the morning raised the bright sunlight into my window

<br />My body woke with much delight feeling fresh
<br />with loves morning glow on my face 
<br />letting me no that another day was to come 
<br />being alive to have eyes to see this most beautiful 
<br />sight and ears to hear the birds sing their songs to me
<br />as the night i heard the wolf howl at the moon 
<br />and all the creatures that had moved like the wise old owl 
<br />who stond right out side my window to say who me .
<br />The beauity in this crazy world i have find not just with friends 
<br />and family but with the creatures who ran all over this earth 
<br />and my soul finds peace and happiest where it goes and 
<br />every where it touches Only God knows but throught it all
