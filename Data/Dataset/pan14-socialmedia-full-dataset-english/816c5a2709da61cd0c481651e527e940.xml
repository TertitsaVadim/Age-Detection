<br />Looking at you baby
<br />Feeling it too baby
<br />If I’m asking you to hold me tight 
<br />then it’s gonna be all right
<br /><br />[Chorus] 
<br />It’s gonna be Love
<br />It’s gonna be great 
<br />It’s gonna be more then I can take

<br />It’s gonna be real
<br />It’s gonna change everything I feel 
<br />It’s gonna be sad 
<br />It’s gonna be true
<br />It’s gonna be me baby
<br />It’s gonna be you baby
<br />It’s gonna be...Its gonna be Love
<br /><br />Time am I restless or a fool?
<br />How can you pretend to be so cruel?
<br />Maybe it’s me baby
<br />Maybe it's true baby
<br />Maybe it's everything were dreaming of
<br />We waited long enough
<br /><br />[Chorus] 
<br />Its gonna be Love
<br />It’s gonna be great 
<br />It’s gonna be more then I can take

<br />To justify all the hurt inside 
<br />Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes 
<br />Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one 
<br />They're saying &quot;Mamma never loved her much&quot; 
<br />And,&quot;Daddy never keeps in touch 
<br />That's why she shies away from human affection&quot; 
<br />But somewhere in a private place 
<br />She packs her bags for outer space 
<br />And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come 
<br />And she'll say to him 
<br /><br />I would fly to the moon and back if you'll be my baby 
<br />Got a ticket for a world where we belong 
<br />So would you be my baby? 
<br />She can't remember a time when she felt needed 
<br />If love was red then she was color blind 
<br />All her friends they've been tried for treason 
<br />And crimes that were never defined 
<br />She's saying&quot;Love is like a barren place 
<br />And reaching out for human faith is like a journey 
<br />I just don't have a map for&quot; 
<br />So baby's gonna take a dive and 
<br />Push the shift to overdrive 
<br />Send a signal that she's hanging 
<br />All her hopes on the stars 
<br />What a pleasant dream 
<br />I would fly to the moon and backif you'll be my baby 
<br />Got a ticket for a world where we belong &quot;repeat&quot;
<br /><br />if you know why can you tell me????

<br />I'll just scream it in my mind
<br />Nothing good in life is scripted
<br />It's not like we predicted
<br />That the one you want
<br />Is gonna be the one you thought
<br /><br />[Nick:]
<br />I won't tell nobody
<br />But I won't live like a prisoner
<br />Nothing has to be so perfect
<br />Can you tell me was it worth it
<br />Because her heart can't lie
<br />And even though her face may try
<br />Love can keep you up all night
<br /><br />[Chorus (mainly Nick):]
<br />Cause love will keep you up all night
<br />It's not something you can decide
<br />One day you're all alone
<br />The next you're crying on the phone
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />You got a taste of sweet divine
<br />It took you to the other side
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br /><br />[Brian:]
<br />If I don't tell a living soul
<br />Still everyone would know
<br />Yes they would
<br />It's always three am somewhere
<br />You know it when you get there
<br /><br />[AJ:]
<br />Some people try to cover it up
<br />Some people think it's never enough (never enough)
<br /><br />[Chorus (mainly AJ):]
<br />Cause love will keep you up all night
<br />It's not something you can decide
<br />One day you're all alone
<br />The next you're crying on the phone
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />You got a taste of sweet divine
<br />It took you to the other side
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br /><br />[Nick:]
<br />I don't mean to scare you
<br />But everybody has a first time
<br />One day when you're old and gray
<br />Don't look back and never say
<br />You should have tried
<br />Stayed up all night
<br /><br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />It's not something you can decide
<br /><br />[AJ:]
<br />One day you're all alone
<br />The next you're crying on the phone
<br /><br />[All:]
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />You got a taste of sweet divine
<br />It took you to the other side
<br />To the other side
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />It's not something you can decide
<br />One day you're all alone
<br />The next you're cryin', you're cryin'
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />You got a taste of sweet divine
<br />It took you to the other side
<br /><br />Love will keep you up all night
<br />Love will keep you up all night
<br /><br />[AJ:]
<br />Love will keep you up all night

<br />There's no phrase that hits
<br />Like an ocean needs the sand
<br />Or a dirty old shoe that fits

<br />I would only ever want to see you scars
<br />You know they can have their universe
<br />We'll be in the dirt designing stars

<br />You make me feel so beautiful
<br />Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
<br />You make feel so beautiful

<br />There's no crowd to please
<br />I'm like a faith without a clause to believe in it

<br />I would only ever want to see you frown
<br />You know they can sail away in sunsets
<br />We'll be right here stranded on the ground
<br />Just happy to be found
<br /><br />You make me feel so beautiful
<br />Nowhere else in the world I wanna be
<br />You make feel so beautiful

<br />but the mind is an amazing thing
<br />full of candy dreams and new toys
<br />and another cheap hotel
<br />two beds and a coffee machine
<br />but there are groceries to buy
<br />and she knows she'll have to go home
<br /><br />another ditch in the road
<br />you keep moving

<br />you keep moving on
<br />and the years go by so fast
<br />wonder how I ever made it through
<br /><br />another bruise to try and hide 
<br />another alibi to write
<br />another lonely highway in the black of night
<br />there's hope in the darkness
<br />I know you're gonna make it
<br /><br />another ditch in the road

<br />another stop sign
<br />you keep moving on

<br />silent fortress built to last
