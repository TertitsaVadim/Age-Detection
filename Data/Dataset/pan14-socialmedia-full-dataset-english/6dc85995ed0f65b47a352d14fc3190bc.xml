<br />RACING SOUL The 1098 immediately stands out for its determined and aggressive stance. Every detail insists that performance is paramount. 
<br />Traditional Ducati features such as a high set tail section, under-tail exhaust, single-sided swingarm, narrow profile and a rock-solid front end all emphasize the 1098’s aerodynamics and handling capabilities. Add to this a powerful Testastretta Evoluzione engine and you have a Ducati that looks like it's moving even when it's standing still. 
<br /><br />The 1098 is a milestone both for Ducati and production sportbikes in general. It is the first production bike to feature Brembo Monobloc calipers, an onboard data-logging system and new 'smart' technology for the single-sided swingarm. Oval throttle bodies and a the new dashboard are innovations direct from Ducati's MotoGP effort and appear on a road-going sportbike for the first time ever with the 1098. Simply put, the 1098 has a racing soul. 
<br /><br />SATISFYING ALL THE SENSES The throaty roar of the twin under-seat exhausts are synchronized with the howl of the elliptical throttle bodies providing a fitting fanfare for the new 1098 Testastretta Evoluzione engine. The huge 104mm bore and all-new cylinder head design unite to produce an awesome 160hp and an arm-wrenching 90+ lb-fts of torque. Developed together with Ducati Corse, the 1098 is a masterpiece of incredible performance and innovation. Dimensions, Weights, Capacities
