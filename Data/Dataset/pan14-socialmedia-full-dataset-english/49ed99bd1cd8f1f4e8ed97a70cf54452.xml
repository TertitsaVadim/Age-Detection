<br />Woman: &quot;Perhaps. I'm the receptionist at the VD Clinic.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Haven't I seen you someplace before?
<br />Woman: &quot;Yeah, that's why I don't go there anymore.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Is this seat empty?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Yes, and this one will be too if you sit down.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;So, wanna go back to my place ?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Well, I don't know. Will two people fit under a rock?&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Your place or mine?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Both. You go to yours and I'll go to mine.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;I'd like to call you. What's your number?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;It's in the phone book.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;But I don't know your name.&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;That's in the phone book too.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;So what do you do for a living?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;I'm a female impersonator.&quot; 
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Hey, baby, what's your sign?&quot; 
<br />Woman: &quot;Do not Enter&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;How do you like your eggs in the morning?&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Unfertilized !&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Hey, come on, we're both here at this bar for the same reason&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Yeah! Let's pick up some chicks!&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;I know how to please a woman.&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Then please leave me alone.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;I want to give myself to you.&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Sorry, I don't accept cheap gifts.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;If I could see you naked, I'd die happy:
<br />Woman: &quot;Yeah, but if I saw you naked, I'd probably die laughing&quot;.
<br /><br />Man: &quot;Your body is like a temple.&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Sorry, there are no services today.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;I'd go through anything for you.&quot;
<br />Woman: &quot;Good! Let's start with your bank account.&quot;
<br /><br />Man: &quot;I would go to the end of the world for you.
<br />Woman: &quot;Yes, but would you stay there?

Its real and its in your face. A friend is someone who makes your life worth its while a little more than yesterday. While everybody has their own definitions of a &quot;friend&quot;, the long and short of it is we all need friends to make our lives better. We at TheHolidaySpot value our friendship as much as you do and would like to share our ideas of how to become an ideal friend with you, for if wasn't for you we wouldn't be where we are today.
<br /><br />HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY...
<br /><br />In friendship &quot;honesty&quot; is the key word. One should always be honest to his or her friends.
<br />Don't overlook their faults, even if you have none for you are his friend!
<br />Praise them honestly and openly.
<br />Say you're sorry, when you hurt your friend. Don't let them assume it. 
<br /><br />GIVE MORE THAN YOU TAKE...
<br /><br />Be there when they need you or you may wind up alone.
<br />Love them unconditionally, that is the only condition. Make them feel special, because aren't we all special? 
<br />Never forget them, who wants to feel forgotten. 
<br /><br />BE SUPPORTIVE... 
<br /><br />Cheer them on, we all need encouragement now and then. 
<br />Encourage their dreams and aspiration, Life seems almost meaningless without them.
<br />Your words count, use them wisely.
<br />Use good judgement.
<br />Wish them luck, hopefully good 
<br />Eamine your motives before you &quot;help&quot; out
<br />Just be there when they need you
<br />Really listen, a friendly ear is a soothing balm 
<br /><br />FORGIVENESS...
<br /><br />Forgive them for, &quot;To Err is Human&quot;, and you just may end up making the same mistakes in course of time.. 
<br /><br />KEEP THE FAITH...
<br /><br />Have faith in them. For, there is no love without trust.
<br />Zip your lips when they confide in you 
<br /><br />EXPRESS YOURSELF CLEARLY
<br /><br />Know when they need a hug, and couldn't you use one? 
<br />Offer to help, and know when &quot; No thanks&quot; is just politeness 
<br />Quietly disagree, noisy No's make enemies 
<br />Verbalsise your feelings 
<br /><br />HAVE FUN...
<br /><br />Get together often, misery loves company, so does glee.
<br />Talk frequently, communication is important. 
<br /><br />Enjoying your friendship is the order of the day. So its not what we call a friendship if you don't feel right.
<br />Always remember a friendship is worth it when you are able to enjoy the amazing relationship with no holds barred. Its a mutual bond for life that you cant give up.

<br />only good ones and great ones
<br /><br />Hugs are...
<br />non fattening and they don't cause cancer or cavities..
<br />all natural with no preservatives, artificial ingredients or pesticide residue
<br />easy to care for, they are a completely renewable resource..
<br />non-taxable, fully returnable and energy efficient
<br />safe in all kinds of weather
<br />Infact,
<br />Hugs are
<br /> especially good for cold and rainy days
<br />exceptionally effective in treating problems like bad dreams or Monday blues...
<br />Never wait until tomorrow to hug someone you could hug today,
<br />because when you give one,
<br />you get one right back your way!

<br /><br />9. Those who have it think that those who don't are somehow made to feel inferior.  
<br /><br />8. Those who don't have it may agree that it's neat, but think it's not worth the fuss that those who have it make about it. 
<br /><br />7. Many of those who don't have it would like to try it (e-mail envy). 
<br /><br />6. It's more fun when it's up, but this makes it hard to get any real work done. 
<br /><br />5. In the distant past, its only purpose was to transmit information vital to the survival of the species.  Some people still think that's the only thing it should be used for, but most folks today use it for fun most of the time. 
<br /><br />4. If you don't apply the appropriate measures, it can spread viruses. 
<br /><br />3. If you use it too much, you'll find it becomes more and more difficult to think coherently. 
<br /><br />2. We attach an importance to it that is far greater than its actual size and influence warrant. 
<br /><br />1. If you're not careful what you do with it, it can get you into a lot of trouble.

<br />May I sail upon your sea.
<br />May we go through life together;
<br />May there always be a &quot;we.&quot; 
<br />May I be your endless sky;
<br />May you breathe my gentle air.
<br />May you never wonder why
<br />Each time you look for me, I'm there. 
<br /><br />May we be for each a smile
<br />Like the warm, life-giving sun;
<br />Yet when we're in pain awhile,
<br />May our suffering be one. 
<br /><br />May we share our special days,
<br />The happiness of one for two;
<br />And if we must go separate ways,
<br />Let my love remain with you.

<br />And I'll forgive you for not liking me enough.

<br /><br />You forgive me for the loud racing of my heart,
<br />And I'll forgive you for not hearing it.

<br /><br />You forgive me for having hopes and dreams,
<br />And I'll forgive you for crushing them.

<br />than you were willing to give;
<br />So now we've gone our separate ways
<br />each with different lives to live.
<br /><br />The bond will always be there
<br />the friendship always intact;
<br />But the time for us has come and gone
<br />and the pages of time, you can't turn back.
<br /><br />I will always be a friend to you
<br />and wonder how you are;
<br />The smiles and laughter I will remember
<br />and our fights have become painless scars.
<br /><br />Sometimes on those busy days
<br />when you've a thousand things to do;

<br /><br />In that quiet moment

<br />I am still someone who cares.

<br />Something could be funny
<br />Like someone cutting a fart
<br />While handing the cashier money
<br />Then just laugh.
<br /><br />Stop being so serious
<br />About all you have to do
<br />When you are out walking 
<br />If you step in poo
<br />Then just laugh.
<br /><br />If you can find things serious
<br />You can find things funny I suppose
<br />Like if you need a cop
<br />And he’s busy picking his nose
<br />Then just laugh.
<br /><br />And when you quit your job
<br />After telling off your boss
<br />And get a better job
<br />It’s your boss’s loss
<br />Then just laugh.
<br /><br />When you go to sleep at night
<br />And awaken to your cat
<br />Taking up almost all your pillow
<br />And you get spat at
<br />Then just laugh.
<br /><br />As we get up there in years
<br />Laughter is what we really need
<br />When your hair goes gray
<br />Or when your hair recedes
<br />Then just laugh.

<br />&quot;Hey Scott, it's time for bed&quot;
<br />&quot;You go ahead&quot; he answered
<br />&quot;I'll surf the net instead&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;You sure love that computer&quot;
<br />Concern rose in her voice
<br />&quot;But why would you go surfing?
<br />You have another choice&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;I'll only be a minute
<br />I've got some work to do
<br />But you know I would rather
<br />Just climb in bed with you&quot;
<br /><br />So off to bed went Karen
<br />And all alone to sleep
<br />While Scotty started surfin'
<br />And the surf was getting deep
<br /><br />Much later she awakened
<br />The blankets seemed so hot
<br />She felt the space beside her
<br />And wondered, where was Scott?
<br /><br />&quot;I wonder what he's doing
<br />I'm getting up to see
<br />He's surely out there dozing
<br />I'll tiptoe quietly&quot;
<br /><br />The keyboard it was silent
<br />The screen tho' flickered bright
<br />What was it he was doing
<br />In the middle of the night?
<br /><br />She crept right up behind him
<br />Then peeked around to see
<br />And on the screen before her
<br />As naked as can be
<br /><br />Were two young lovely women
<br />Endowed in every way
<br />One was named Miss April
<br />The other was Miss May
<br /><br />&quot;So Scott, what are you watching? &quot;
<br />The screen went blank just then
<br />&quot;Ah- nothing really honey
<br />Just news from CNN&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Oh CNN my eyeball
<br />Those girls had nothing on&quot;
<br />He said &quot;Oh yes I saw them
<br />Their clothing was all gone&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;And that fact did concern me
<br />It made me wonder when
<br />They started going topless
<br />On good old CNN&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Why I'll just call the network
<br />And make a big complaint&quot;
<br />&quot;Don't bother&quot; muttered Karen
<br />&quot;Cause foolin' me you ain't&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Those girls were Playboy Bunnies
<br />They're different from their peers
<br />Aside from wearing nothing
<br />They had on floppy ears&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Was that the Playboy website? &quot;
<br />Scott said convincingly
<br />&quot;Those girls are always naked? ?
<br />That's what you're telling me? ? &quot;
<br /><br />She raised her hand for silence
<br />He knew that he was caught
<br />And further explanation
<br />Would only get her hot
<br /><br />He stood there feeling foolish
<br />Uncertain of his fate
<br />But she just whispered to him
<br />&quot;Let's go, it's getting late&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Just come to bed now Scotty&quot;
<br />But know that in this house
<br />If you surf the Playboy website
<br />You just might lose your mouse&quot;

<br />Start words such as white with an S.
<br />They very well know, S is one key below
<br />And reversal just will not impress.
<br /><br />And look, there are lines without rhythm or rhymes
<br />Where semblance to verse is but fleeting,
<br />But a tightly clenched fist will never assist,
<br />Or will words that do not bear repeating.
<br /><br />And now I'm real vexed, they have just lost my text
<br />And I can't find its new hidden venue.
<br />That DELETE command, has again shown it's hand,
<br />I'll delete the damn thing from my menu.
<br /><br />It seems there is strain betwixt fingers and brain
<br />And I feel that I'd just like to mention,
<br />When my fingers typed 'white' and it didn't sound right
<br />Please believe it was not my intention.

<br />Typing words
<br />When suddenly a wasp appeared
<br />Buzzing loudly
<br />Obviously annoyed

<br />It must have weighed
<br />A couple of pounds!
<br />Heading straight for me
<br />To some eerie

<br />Down the neckline of

<br />Dreadful thoughts
<br /><br />I rip my trousers off
<br />And throw them
<br />to the floor
<br />And then my shorts
<br />No clothes on
<br />anymore

<br /><br />BE CAREFUL OF YOUR BREASTS.
<br /><br />DON'T EVER SQUEEZE OR BRUISE THEM.
<br /><br />AND GIVE THEM MONTHLY TESTS.
<br /><br />SO I HEEDED ALL THEIR WARNINGS,
<br /><br />AND PROTECTED THEM BY LAW.
<br /><br />GUARDED THEM VERY CAREFULLY
<br /><br />AND I ALWAYS WORE MY BRA.
<br /><br />AFTER 30 YEARS OF ASTUTE CARE,
<br /><br />MY DOCTOR FOUND A LUMP.
<br /><br />SHE ORDERED UP A MAMMOGRAM,
<br /><br />TO LOOK INSIDE THAT BUMP.
<br /><br />&quot;STAND UP VERY CLOSE&quot; SHE SAID.
<br /><br />AS SHE GOT MY BOOB IN LINE,
<br /><br />&quot;AND TELL ME WHEN IT HURTS&quot; SHE SAID.
<br /><br />&quot;AH YES! THERE, THAT'S FINE.&quot;
<br /><br />SHE STEPPED UPON A PEDDLE.
<br /><br />I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES!
<br /><br />A PLASTIC PLATE PRESSED DOWN AND DOWN,
<br /><br />MY BOOB WAS IN A VISE!
<br /><br />MY SKIN WAS STRETCHED AND STRETCHED,
<br /><br />FROM WAY UP UNDER MY CHIN.
<br /><br />MY POOR BOOB WAS BEING SQUASHED,
<br /><br />TO SWEDISH PANCAKE THIN.
<br /><br />EXCRUCIATING PAIN I FELT.
<br /><br />WITHIN IT'S VICE-LIKE GRIP.
<br /><br />A PRISONER IN THIS VISCOUS THING,
<br /><br />MY POOR DEFENSELESS TIT!
<br /><br />&quot;TAKE A DEEP BREATH&quot; SHE SAID TO ME,
<br /><br />WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE'S KIDDING?
<br /><br />MY CHEST IS MASHED IN HER MACHINE,
<br /><br />AND WOOZY I AM GETTING.
<br /><br />&quot;THERE, THAT WAS GOOD&quot; I HEARD HER SAY
<br /><br />AS THE ROOM WAS SLOWLY SWAYING.
<br /><br />&quot;NOW, LET'S HAVE A GO AT THE OTHER ONE&quot;.
<br /><br />LORD HAVE MERCY I WAS PRAYING.
<br /><br />IT SQUEEZED ME FROM UP AND DOWN.
<br /><br />IT SQUEEZED ME FROM BOTH SIDES.
<br /><br />I'LL BET SHE'S NEVER HAD THIS DONE,
<br /><br />NOT TO HER TENDER LITTLE HIDE!
<br /><br />IF I HAD NO PROBLEM WHEN I CAME IN,
<br /><br />I SURELY HAVE ONE NOW.
<br /><br />IF THERE HAD BEEN A CYST IN THERE,
<br /><br />IT WOULD HAVE POPPED, KER-POW!
<br /><br />THIS MACHINE WAS DESIGNED BY MAN,
<br /><br />OF THIS I HAVE NO DOUBT.
<br /><br />I'D LIKE TO STICK HIS BALLS IN THERE,
<br /><br />AND SEE HOW THEY COME OUT

<br /><br />Are you sending me signals, or are you going crazy?&quot;
<br /><br />The woman replies, &quot;I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I have a rare condition and when I sneeze, I have an orgasm.&quot;
<br /><br />The man, now feeling a little embarrassed but even more curious says, &quot;I've never heard of that before. What are you taking for it?&quot;
<br /><br />The woman looks at him and says, &quot;Pepper.&quot;

<br /><br />Chewing gum you perv!!!!!
<br /><br />Q: What is green, fury, and smells like pork?
<br /><br />A: Kermitt the Frog's fingers.
<br /><br />One day a young boy finds a condom on the floor. He brings is to his father and asks, &quot;What is it?&quot; 
<br /><br />His father replies, &quot;Oh, that's a twinkie son, if you find anymore bring them to me and I'll give you a quarter.&quot;
<br /><br />The next week the little boy returned to his mother's house with a lot of quarters. 
<br /><br />His mother asks, &quot;Where did you get all those quarters?&quot; 
<br /><br />The little boy answered, &quot;Daddy gave them to me for finding twinkies for him, but what he doesn't know is, before I gave them to him, I sucked all the cream filling out.
<br /><br />An American businessman was in Japan. 
<br /><br />He hired a local hooker and was going at it all night with her. 
<br /><br />She kept screaming &quot;Fujifoo, Fugifoo!!!&quot;, which the guy took to mean pleasurable.. 
<br /><br />The next day, he was golfing with his Japanese counterparts and he got a hole-in-one. Wanting to impress the clients, he said &quot;Fujifoo&quot;. 
<br /><br />The Japanese clients looked confused and said &quot;What do you mean, wrong hole.&quot;
<br /><br />A guy finally gets a date with an easy blonde. To prepare for the date he sunbathes in the nude on his roof, falls asleep and burns his manhood. 
<br /><br />He doesn't want to cancel so he slathers it with lotion and wraps it in gauze. The blonde shows up at his house, and he treats her to a home-cooked dinner. 
<br /><br />Afterwards they go to the living room to watch a movie. His manhood starts to bother him again so he excuses himself, goes into the kitchen, pours a glass of milk and immerses himself for immediate relief. 
<br /><br />The blonde, however, wanted to know what he was doing and walks in on him with his Johnson in the milk and exclaims, &quot;So that's how you guys load those things!&quot;

<br />Laughed and confided, you even shared pics.
<br />This message is posted to tell Kate is away,
<br />She has morphed into someone quite different today !!!
<br /><br />You will find her in chat rooms as wildgentlebreeze
<br />Her hormones are raging, quite hard to please
<br />She's cutting, sarcastic and sometimes quite lewd,
<br />Not at all like the Kate 26 that you knew !!!
<br /><br />The seasons change less than Kate 26 moods
<br />Sometimes she's a cartoon, at others a nude.
<br />With each different picture she changes her name,
<br />Don't take it personal, it is part of her game.
<br /><br />Sometimes she is funny, flirtatious and fat,
<br />At others real lonely and missing her cat.
<br />She is friendly or furious, on Mondays she's meek,
<br />At least five different people by the end of the week !!
<br /><br />On Tuesday she has kids on Wednesday there's none,
<br />Cause this is the night Kate 26 has her fun.
<br />She is hetro and mono, bi and is gay,
<br />This isn't confusing, it just depends on the day !!!!
<br /><br />On Fridays real sporty, off with the crowd,
<br />On Saturdays dancing with music played loud.
<br />She climbed mountains and sailed, loved and she lost,
<br />Went riding on horseback, took drugs and smoked pot !!
<br /><br />Lived in Perth and Kentucky, sometimes as a bot,
<br />Lived in cold snowy places, others quite hot.
<br />But the truth to be known; ask if you dare,
<br />Kate 26 never moved from her chair !!!!!!!!
<br /><br />And I guess that's the magic of internet chat,
<br />Some people are honest, some wear different hats.
<br />So remember behind clever names on the screen,
<br />There are people there typing who are not what they seem !!
<br /><br />And as for your new friend, young Kate 26,
<br />She looks nothing like that sexy young chic.
<br />Though her mind is still sharp, her fingers move quick,
<br />She probably thinks you're a bit of a Dick !!!
<br /><br />She has four grown children, she's old and is grey,
<br />Re- living her youth in a 'virtual' way.
<br />To find the real person, I'm sorry to say,
<br />It's a pity but matey ____ You picked the WRONG DAY !!!!
