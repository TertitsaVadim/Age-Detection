<br />And there's no way to get you off my mind,
<br />I try so hard to breathe without you, sleep without you,
<br />But deep down I'm dieing inside.
<br /><br />Now your gone,
<br />I've got to be strong,
<br />To get me through,
<br />This life without you.
<br /><br />Each tear I cry,
<br />I wonder why,
<br />Why I let you go,
<br />All that time ago.
<br /><br />Because you were the reason for the smile on my face,
<br />And it hurts so hard to know your in a different place,
<br />Whenever my world starts falling down,
<br />I look for you,
<br />But you can't be found.</em>

<br /><br />So I thought I'd put my youtube channel link up, there are some really old singing vids from years ago and a few random ones  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/whistling.gif" alt=":)" /> (dont ask!) and its only the last 2 that are the most recent.
<br /><br />So go ahead and have a nosey, I'd love any feedback as I'm hoping to try for the X Factor again next year as I missed my audition this year  <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />

You see young girls and boys saying 'I Love You' but yet they have only been in a relationship for 5 minutes. You go through a break up and they tell you the love has just 'died'. Or theres the couples your always jealous of because no matter what, they always seem soo strong. I just dont get it. All ive ever done is put others first before myself and i still manage to get hurt or made to feel like im selfish <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Well you know what? From now im going to put myself first and focus on what i want. I give up with guys and relationships. Im going to concentrate on my job, enjoy my hobbies and return to the happy go lucky girl i used to be! Im not going to give a sob story but ive been through a lot more than most people but im still lucky to have the life i have. Some people just dont respect the bad things ive been through. And its only the people that do fully understand me that are with me through the good times.
<br /><br />So, back to the subject, my definition of love .. The unconditional caring for friends and family, having them in your mind always and being there to lend a shoulder to cry on or an ear to listen. Its not a word  that can just be used when you feel like you fancy someone.

<br /><br />Kind of contridicts my last blog, but who doesnt want someone to love. This time i just need to be careful and find someone who wont let me down or hurt me, so im going to sit back and let it come to me. Its crap being lonely, seeing friends happy and loved up.
<br /><br />If i could turn back time, id walk away from every relationship to save myself being heartbroken ..

		<document id="6bbc5c829de71a4b67317eba017a65ae" url=""><![CDATA[Marmite..<br/><br/>You either love me or hate me, and with my luck most people seem to hate me? But i dont care, I am who I am. I can act immature, have a laugh and giggle, but sometimes im the opposite. Im shy, find it hard to talk to people and extremely self concious. And that is what others seem to see in me. 
<br /><br />Ive learnt to live with how my life has turned out so this is basically a blog for anyone else who has been in a similar situation. Just be true to yourself, and live your own life, peoples opinions dont matter, even if it gets to you, just let it go over your head, smile and carry on.
<br /><br />Sooo, move on from one of my less happpy blogs .. Smile <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> im nearly 21!! Less than 9 days, and im soo excited. And this time i wont let 'certain' people get me down. They dont want to be a part of my life so im not going to waste a second thinking about them. I have the best friends i could ask for and thats all i need!!
<br /><br />Anyhoo guys, quick question.. Anyone want to send me Paul Walker in the post?? Would be greatly appriciated <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />

Getting majorly excited now as i know friends and family have a few surprises up their sleeves!! I still dont know how to celebrate it just yet but im sure ill think of something. This birthday is going to be special, not just because im going to be 21, but its also going to be the start of a new me! A fresh year starting from next week is exactly what i need. Anything that has happened around this time in the past will be forgotten, whether good or bad memories, as i have all the friends and family i need in my life! Plus its also a year since ive been at my job so im going to use that as an excuse to party even more <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Anyhoo, i have very nearly finished my room, i have my new bed (which was surprisingly uncomfy last night) its all painted (obviously pink, duhh) and all that is left to do is finish unpacking a few more boxes of stuff! Its quite funny actually as my room now looks like a 6 year old girls room as im a teeny weeny little tiny bit obsessed with Hello Kitty!! Im sure ive got the numbers the wrong way round and im actually going to be 12 instead. I just have a very young mental age and im still a big kid at heart <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Still cant believe how quick a year has gone, ive done soo much the time has just flown by, but that is for another blog. Ive become a bit of a compulsive blogger recently. I just like to waffle on and fill everyone's heads with random nonsense <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Soo on that note, think its sleepy time for me as ive just finished at the pub and lucky me gets to work on a sunday all on my lonesome <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />

		<document id="c7bcca5bde95a9b6413b5c0f90e59ce0" url=""><![CDATA[And Another Year Has Gone<br/><br/>Soo im finally 21, doesnt really feel any different. Im still convinced everyone has got my age back to front, the amount of Hello Kitty stuff i got was unbelievable! But it was still a great day and night. I managed to get a date with Paul Walker <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> ok maybe not the real Paul Walker but the blow up doll was a very good look a like!!
<br /><br />Its the start of a new year and im soo excited with what its going to bring. Ive managed to get a day in a recording studio where ill go through vocal training, a few rehersals and then record my own unmixed cd aswell as doing a mini photoshoot for the cover! This is officially the beginning of my singing career. I love it and i sing every week at the pub i work at. I cant thank everyone enough who has made this possible and everyone who has influenced me in the past year. Lets hope good one ey??
<br /><br />And on that note i think i need to head to bed, was a bit of a late night so im feeling a tad bit tired. My normally blogging obsession shall resume soon <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Niigghht!!

		<document id="31c25518cddc34febec154fc5082a324" url=""><![CDATA[Is A Dream Always A Dream??<br/><br/>Don't you ever wonder, what life would be like if you had done something differently in the past, even if it was only a few seconds ago? Does it always have to be a 'what if'?
<br /><br />It happens to soo many people, you can think of a whole situation in your head and wish it was true, if that was what really happened, or what you want to happen. You build yourself up, hoping that it will, you wait, and then you find out it doesn't. It's like a woman thinking her partner is going to propose, she thought she knew straight away that's what he was planning, then he doesn't. You feel shattered and your world doesn't seem to be the one you want it to.
<br /><br />Or, in another scenario, you have one thing going right, but not the other that would make things complete. You either have one thing or the other. Like a job and no one to call your own. Or your in a loving relationship, but you have no hobbies or interests. And in the end, because your unsatisfied, you end up with nothing and your back to square one, wishing what if!
<br /><br />There are some cases where people are just selfish, because they have the money, the looks and they still want more. Where some of us just one someone to love, and to be able to come home from work and for them to be there. It's always the smaller details that make the bigger picture. Gives someone a bigger perspective of what they actually want out of life.
<br /><br />This happens far too much to me and there are people out there who brand me as selfish. I'm a 21 year old woman, who knows exactly what she wants in life. Someone to love, her own home, a family, children, pets, a good job, hobbies and friends that will always be there no matter what. What's so bad about that??

<br /><br />And i shall start by saying im weirdly excited for halloween!! That excited i have decided to wear a pumpkin costume to work, aslong as i dont frighten the customers!! I'll make sure i post some pictures on here <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/biggrin.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Rigghhtt, if you were to ask one (reasonable) question what would it be? Like for example, do I have a crazy side? (yes) Am I a tall dwarf or just a tiny giant? Anything random, go ahead. Just nothing to do with sex, being naked blah blah. Just random questions about things you probably dont need to know or care about

I've managed to write a list of words that I want my song to be about, then going to make up a sentence to go with each word. Then hopefully I'll try and fit them together somehow and it might work <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> soo if anyone can suggest just ONE word I'd be grateful. Once I've got the lyrics im going to attempt to write the music which I've never done!! Looks like it's off to the library to get a book on how to play piano. I can play, just have noo clue and which note is which!! Some keys are White and some are black and make different noises. I'm not worried at all, this will sound great!! Or not..
<br /><br />Anyhoo, in the world of me, not much has changed, still working stupidly long hours at work, doing my singing, Zumba 3 times a week, street dance, driving.. Phew it's a hectic life but I wouldn't have it any other way!! Pretty tired now so I'm going to stop staring at the screen and crack on with my lyrics ..

I'm sick of people asking for my msn, if you ACTUALLY read my profile you'd see that I DON'T have it!! And then I get messages saying I don't reply?? Sorry but if you can't take the time to read a few words on my profile then I clearly won't waste my time replying <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" /> and while I'm in the subject of messages, I get that many (not being big headed) that I don't get the chance to reply to the people that actually seem decent. Anyone I have replied to, feel special <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/smile.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />Also, there's a lot of haters on this site!! I've had soo many horrible comments/messages and ive seen it on others profiles too! These people need to grow up!! Their lives are that bad, they make themselves feel better by picking on others and putting others down! Classic bully! It's not funny nor cool!!
<br /><br />Another thing that really p!sses me off is people saying 'I want to get to know you, please ring.....' blah blah shut up and go away!! One, why would I ring a stranger that, most of the time, isn't English. And two, it's probably a scam and you'll get charged stupid amounts of money for calling the number. So anyone that would be stupid enough to, don't!!

<br /><br />For example, without sounding big headed, I know I'm not ugly, I'm not a horrible person, not greedy, vindictive, selfish. I'm a good and nice person in general. And all I want in life is to find that special person to make memories, share stories, go on adventures and eventually settle down and start my own family. So why hasn't it happened? And without sounding offensive to any other girl.. You see some couples with such a messed up life, with children, own home, engaged or married. Like my nextdoor neighbours, I myself wouldn't class either of them attractive, they always argue, screaming, fighting but yet they are still together with a young child. I was happy in a relationship, always put them first, did as much as I could for them. But in the end they decided to leave. I really don't understand <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" />
<br /><br />I have my own house, sharing with a very good friend who I love to bits. But a part of me wishes I was sharing my house with someone else, someone I loved more than a friend, someone to plan the future with.
<br /><br />I guess its just karma, or fate. I've had soo much happen to me so far in my life, that I think my whole life is going to carry on the same way. Being hurt, used and let down. And I'm going to carry on putting others first without thinking about what I want or need.
<br /><br />Sods law eh??
<br /><br />So I'll leave it at that, far to emotional so time to sleep..
