<br /><br />Yer so X-mas day, New years eve and New years day, were some of the best days of my life, and I thank you for that. You made me think... well you made me think so many diffirent things, but in the back of my head I knew... It was going to happen again, my heart was going to snap, and you were going to be the cause.
<br /><br />I wanted to be your friend. I thought you couldnt lie to me, we told each other everything... Why, why lie to me about the one thing you promised me you wouldnt do... <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/sad.gif" alt=":)" /> . You didnt want to hurt no one... how many times have we both heard that story. Now calling it off was fine... I understood why, but the lie... I dont think i can ever forgive you for that.
<br /><br />I cant stop loving you like that! But you sure damm well made it easier for me to want to stop loving you!

<br />ladies are attracted to guys they fall in love with.
<br />If you really and truly love someone,
<br />then set them free,
<br />if they come back,
<br />then the love was meant to be...but if they never return,
<br />then they were never yours...
<br />You never lose by loving...You always lose by holding back...
<br />For everything you have missed, you have gained something else
<br />A person needs to be loved the most when he deserves to be loved the least.
<br />Build on faith rather than on doubts.
<br />It's not what is said, done or heard...but what is felt in your heart
<br />Sometimes you have to stand alone to make sure you still can
<br />Love is like quicksand - the deeper you fall in, the harder it is to get out
<br />I always knew I'd look back at the tears and laugh,
<br />but I never thought I'd look back at the laughs and cry
<br />How lucky I am to have known someone who was so hard to say goodbye to
<br />A man wants a woman to be his first love.
<br />A woman wants a man to be her last romance.
<br />If we don't attempt to get over our doubts and fears,
<br />we'll never discover how wonderful it is to live without them
<br />The magic of first love is the belief that will never end
<br />Don't marry someone because you can live with them,
<br />marry someone because you can't live without them
<br />A person dies only when they're forgotten
<br />It hurts when something good ends,
<br />but it'll hurt even more if you cling to it knowing that its no longer there.
<br />If the only place where I could see you was in my dreams,
<br />I'll sleep forever.
<br />If I could reach up and hold a star for every time you made me smile,
<br />I'll have the entire night sky in the palm of my hand.
<br />Love is just one word, but it has too many meanings.
<br />Love is like a butterfly, it settles upon you when you least expect it.
<br />The sound of a kiss is much softer than that of a canon,
<br />but its echo lasts a great deal longer.
<br />When I really miss you, I don't have to go far...
<br />I just look inside my heart, because that's always where you are.
<br />They say kissing is the language of love.
<br />Care to indulge in a little conversation?
<br />You know it's love when you can't fall asleep,
<br />because reality is better than your dreams
