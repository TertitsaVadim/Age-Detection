<br /><br />by Alfred, Lord Tennyson 
<br /><br />Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
<br />Tears from the depth of some divine despair
<br />Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
<br />In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,
<br />And thinking of the days that are no more.
<br /><br />Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
<br />That brings our friends up from the underworld,
<br />Sad as the last which reddens over one
<br />That sinks with all we love below the verge;
<br />So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.
<br /><br />Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
<br />The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds
<br />To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
<br />The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
<br />So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.
<br /><br />Dear as remembered kisses after death,
<br />And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned
<br />On lips that are for others; deep as love,
<br />Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
<br />O Death in Life, the days that are no more!
<br /><br />regards,
<br /><br />Mrs. Saqib Saleem

<br /><br />I am a rose, you are my thorns,

<br />to share life, love, and happiness.
<br /><br />Always.

<br /><br />Most Beautiful Heart 
<br /><br />One day a young man was standing in the middle
<br />of the town proclaiming that he had the most
<br />beautiful heart in the whole valley. A large
<br />crowd gathered and they all admired his heart 
<br />for it was perfect.
<br />There was not a mark or a flaw in it.
<br />Yes, they all agreed it truly was the most
<br />beautiful heart they had ever seen.
<br />The young man was very proud and boasted
<br />more loudly about his beautiful heart. 
<br /><br />Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of
<br />the crowd and said, &quot;Why your heart is not
<br />nearly as beautiful as mine.&quot;
<br /><br />The crowd and the young man looked at the 
<br />old man's heart. It was beating strongly,
<br />but full of scars, it had places where pieces
<br />had been removed and other pieces put in, but
<br />they didn't fit quite right and there were
<br />several jagged edges. In fact, in some places 
<br />there were deep gouges where whole pieces
<br />were missing.
<br /><br />The people stared -- how can he say his heart
<br />is more beautiful, they thought?
<br />The young man looked at the old man's heart
<br />and saw its state and laughed.
<br /><br />&quot;You must be joking,&quot; he said. 
<br />&quot;Compare your heart with mine, mine is perfect
<br />and yours is a mess of scars and tears.&quot;
<br /><br />&quot;Yes,&quot; said the old man, &quot;Yours is perfect
<br />looking but I would never trade with you.
<br />You see, every scar represents a person to 
<br />whom I have given my love - I tear out a piece
<br />of my heart and give it to them, and often
<br />they give me a piece of their heart which fits
<br />into the empty place in my heart, but because
<br />the pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges, 
<br />which I cherish, because they remind me of the
<br />love we shared. &quot;Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart
<br />away, and the other person hasn't returned
<br />a piece of his heart to me. These are the
<br />empty gouges -- giving love is taking a chance. 
<br /><br />Although these gouges are painful, they stay open,
<br />reminding me of the love I have for these people too,
<br />and I hope someday they may return and fill the
<br />space I have waiting. So now do you see what true beauty is?&quot; 
<br /><br />The young man stood silently with tears running
<br />down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,
<br />reached into his perfect young and beautiful heart,
<br />and ripped a piece out. He offered it to the old 
<br />man with trembling hands 
<br /><br />The old man took his offering, placed it in his heart
<br />and then took a piece from his old scarred heart and
<br />placed it in the wound in the young man's heart.
<br />It fit, but not perfectly, as there were some jagged edges. 
<br />The young man looked at his heart, not perfect
<br />anymore but more beautiful than ever,
<br />since love from the old man's heart flowed into his.
<br />They embraced and walked away side by side.

<br /><br />Verily a dead man is taken to the grave, and then the (believer) man (or person) sits in his grave without fear and perturbation. 
<br /><br />Afterwards it is said to him:Wherein were you? He will reply: I was in Islam.He will then he asked:Who is this man? He will reply: Muhammad, The Messenger of Allah. He came to us with clear proof from Allah and so we did believe in him.It will be questioned to him:Have you seen Allah? He will reply: It is not in power of anybody to see Allah.
<br /><br />Then an opening will be made out for him towards the Fire, and he will see towards it, some hurling down over others. It will be said to him: Look what Allah has saved you from. Then an opening for him will be made towards Paradise and he will cast his glance towards it and what is therein. It will be said to him: This is your place; upon the sure (belief) you lived and on it you will be raised up if the Almighty Allah so wills.

Then an opening will be made for him towards the Fire. He will look at it that some of them were hurling others down. It will be said to him: This is your place, upon doubt you live, upon it you died, and upon it you will be raised up again if the Almighty Allah so wills.

<br /><br />&quot;The Kingdom&quot;
<br /><br />(Revealed at Mecca, Verses 30)
<br /><br />In the name of Allah, The Merciful, The All-merciful
<br /><br />Blessed be He in whose hand is the kingdom, and He is powerful over everything;(1)
<br /><br />who created death and life, that He may try you which of you is fairest in works; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,(2)
<br /><br />who created seven heavens in regions; thou dost not see any disparity in the creation of the All-merciful; return thy gaze; dost thou see any fissure?(3)
<br /><br />Return thy gaze second time; and thy gaze shall come back to thee, repelled and aweary.(4)
<br /><br />And We have adorned the nearer heaven with lamps, and made them means to stone the devils, and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.(5)
<br /><br />And for those who disbelieve in their Lord will be the punishment of Hell; and how evil is the destination!(6)
<br /><br />When they are cast into it, they will hear it roaring, while it boils,(7)
<br /><br />as if it would burst with fury. Whenever a troop is cast into it, its keepers ask them, `did not a warner come to you?'(8)
<br /><br />They say, `yes indeed, a warner did come to us, but we cried lies, and said, `God has not sent down anything; you are only gravely astray.'(9)
<br /><br />And they say, `if we had only listened or had understood, we would not have been among the inhabitants of the Blaze.'(10)
<br /><br />So they confess their sins; cursed be the inhabitants of the Blaze!(11)
<br /><br />Surely those who fear their Lord in the unseen, for them shall be forgiveness and a big wage.(12)
<br /><br />And be you secret in your speech or talk it aloud, He knows the thoughts in the breasts.(13)
<br /><br />Shall He who created not know? And He is the Subtle, the Aware.(14)
<br /><br />It is He who made the earth subdued to you, so walk about in its tracts, and eat of His provision; and to Him is the Uprising.(15)
<br /><br />Do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to sink with you, while it shakes?(16)
<br /><br />Do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not loose a storm of gravel against you,? Then you will know how My warning was?(17)
<br /><br />And indeed those before them also cried lies, then how was My denial?(18)
<br /><br />And have they not seen the birds above them spreading and closing their wings? Naght holds them except the All-merciful? Surely He sees everything.(19)
<br /><br />Or who is this that shall be your host, apart from the All-merciful, to help you? The unbelievers are only in delusion.(20)
<br /><br />Or who is this that shall provide for you, if He withholds His provision? No, but they persist in disdain and aversion.(21)
<br /><br />Is he who walks prone on his face better guided or he who walks upright on a straight path?(22)
<br /><br />Say, `it is He who produced you, and made for you ears, eyes and hearts; little thanks you show.'(23)
<br /><br />Say, `it is He who spread you abroad in the earth and to Him you shall be mustered'.(24)
<br /><br />And they say, `when shall this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?'(25)
<br /><br />Say, `the knowledge is only with God, and I am only a clear warner.'(26)
<br /><br />But when they see it near at hand, the faces of the unbelievers will be in distress, and it will be said, `this is what you have been calling to.'(27)
<br /><br />Say, `have you considered, if God destroys me and those that are with me, or has mercy on us, who will protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment?'(28)
<br /><br />Say, `He is the All-merciful; in Him we believe, and in Him we put our trust; and you shall soon know as to who is clearly astray?'(29)
<br /><br />Say, `have you considered, if your water sinks into the earth, then who would bring you gushing spring water?'(30)

<br /><br />Ah! My mother, weep not for your son
<br /><br />For to the Divine Promise and Gardens, I have gone,
<br /><br />To the One Who can pardon my sins 
<br /><br />And that which these two hands have transgressed in,
<br /><br />And I have left the amusements of the Lowly World
<br /><br />For a people who find in it their aspirations and goals,
<br /><br />And for the Pleasure of my Lord, I have given my soul 
<br /><br />When He called me, I answered the Call,
<br /><br />Cry not, O Mother, for a son
<br /><br />Who went forth towards the sharp spears,
<br /><br />Seeking death in honour and pride
<br /><br />Refusing to live in humiliation,

<br /><br />Showing the path to the Gardens,

<br /><br />But the D?n of All?h, I testify, is more precious 
<br /><br />To me than this life, in which all are bound to perish,
<br /><br />Precious Mother, I am wearing a crown
<br /><br />And dwelling in Castles, amongst the Choirs,
<br /><br />With a Virgin who hums to me melodies
<br /><br />Giving me drink from the tips of her fingers, 
<br /><br />Because I fought, I have been embraced by her breasts
<br /><br />And her heart which is full of affection,
<br /><br />And verily I hope for a Day
<br /><br />When for you I can intercede,
<br /><br />So patience, in the Path of All?h, patience 
<br /><br />Because O Precious Mother, the Lowly World is a few seconds.

<br />visible. And the waves of love in the hearts will also be visible.
<br />These dresses will never become old, never be dirty and will never tear.  
<br />There will be four canals in every Jannah. They are of water,
<br />milk,honey
<br />and Sharabun Tahoora. There will also be three fountains in Jannah.

<br /><br />O, Allah; make his entry into Jannah. 
<br /><br />And if a person makes Du'a for safety from Jahannum three times, the Jahannnum requests Allah

<br /><br />Uqbah bin Amr (r.a.) said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him): 
<br /><br />“How can salvation be achieved?” 
<br /><br />He (peace be upon him) replied, “Control your tongue, keep to your house, and weep over your sins.”
