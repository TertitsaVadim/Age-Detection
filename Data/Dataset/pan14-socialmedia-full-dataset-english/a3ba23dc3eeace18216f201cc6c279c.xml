One of the key features of this form of signage for hotels and similar businesses is that LED signs can be updated quickly and easily. They can also be set to display specific messages at certain times in the day. Businesses of this kind will usually have to update their rates and offers at various times throughout the week and even throughout the day. Depending on occupancy levels, bookings and cancellations, hotels and guesthouses may wish to adjust their rates at certain times. If the building is largely unoccupied on a given day, it is not unusual for room rates to be lowered considerably in order to attract business. In an environment where prices are changing rapidly dynamic signage is essential. Managers and staff need to be in a position where they can advertise offers and reductions immediately and effectively to the public, which simply cannot be done with a static traditional sign .Many hotels opt for signage that combines both dynamic and static elements. Generally they choose to have the name of the hotel on a traditional billboard, as this part of their display will not require regular updating. Most hotels will then incorporate an LED message board into their signage, which can be updated to feature the latest rates, offers, and announcements. For example, this message board may feature information about an ongoing or upcoming conference in the hotel. It may be used to congratulate a newly married couple who are holding their reception on the premises. Alternatively the message board could feature information about meal prices, or upcoming entertainment in the hotel. Within the hotel itself LED display boards are often seen affixed to walls, or as freestanding sandwich boards. These boards are used to inform guests of ongoing events within the hotel. For example conference members can be directed to the correct room in the hotel by a message board placed in the reception area. Similarly wedding guests and members of private parties can find the appropriate locations in the hotel by reading the message board. Health club members and guests can be informed of fitness classes or special events by this method also, and LED display boards can also be used to advertise meal deals, day tours and other occasional events.

We aim to transform the nations home entertainment systems; once you see a LED TV there is little chance that your will ever go back to either a plasma or LCD equivalent. LED TV are the very latest generation of LCD televisions that have reached the market yet unless you are TV specialist the chances are you know relatively little about them. The current range of LED TV on the market is quite limited and is dominated by a few of the major consumer electronic manufactures such as Sharp, LG and Samsung.  Samsung in particular are seen as innovators within this market place as it is they that originally pioneered the LED TV technology. This domination of the LED TV market will not last forever and all the other major players in the home entertainment sector are doing their most to catch up as quickly as possible and will all be adding LED TV to flat screen TV line-up in the coming months.  This increased in competition should see a downward pressure on prices, making LED TV much more affordable.

LED screen TV scan be better described as LED back-lit LCD screens: they’re made of lots of Light Emitting Diodes, with a normal LCD screen in front. The advantages over normal LCD TV are due to the different kind of back-lighting LED provide. Because these diodes can be switched on and off very quickly, fast moving images are displayed without blurring. LED-backlit screens also give great, deep blacks in dark scenes. LED screens with local dimming’ are able to switch power to different areas of the led screen TV on and off independently, giving very high contrast rates. Edge-lit LED screens (the alternative to local dimming) are incredibly energy efficient – using around 40% less power than equivalent LCD screen.
