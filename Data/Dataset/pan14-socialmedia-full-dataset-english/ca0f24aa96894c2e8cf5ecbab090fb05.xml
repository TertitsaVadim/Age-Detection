The virtues of <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbmdyZWVuZ29vZHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2JhdGh0dWIvZHJvcC1pbi1iYXRodHViLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">acrylic bathtub</a> make it the mainstream product on the world market currently. Acrylic bathtubs can have many shapes and the prices are affordable, while the surface hardness is lower than cast iron bathtubs and steel bathtubs, the surface would be scratched easily without carefully usage.

For hardware parts, such as faucets and mixers, please clean the remained shampoo and lotion immediately, if they remain in the chrome surface for long time, they will degrade the surface gloss and directly affect the hardware quality. You’d better clean the faucets and mixers by neutral detergent every 3 to 5 days. For existing small scratches, grind the surface by towel with wax or toothpaste until the scratches disappear, then clean and dry them by soft cloth. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbmdyZWVuZ29vZHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2JhdGh0dWIvZHJvcC1pbi1iYXRodHViLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">acrylic bathtub</a>
<br />7. Deal with pipeline blockage at any moment and disinfect, clean the pipe at least once a week. It can remove the bad smell and prevent the growth of bacteria. You can use special cleaning sewer products, fill them into the sewer, keep five minutes, and then clean at once. If the <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbmdyZWVuZ29vZHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2JhdGh0dWIvZHJvcC1pbi1iYXRodHViLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">acrylic bathtub</a> is jammed, close the water valve, put some water into the bathtub, place the rubber sucker on the valve, choke up the overflow, at the same time, turn on the valve, and then suck up and down quickly,  the dirt and hair will be sucked out, clear them away promptly after that. If the bathtub is blocked seriously, please repeat the above steps several times until clearing.
<br />8. When having a shower, the water temperature in the bathtub should not exceed 80 ?, please fill in cold water firstly, then add hot water; this way could extend the bathtub life. Fill in hot water into the bathtub directly is prohibited. Acrylic products begin to soften if the temperature reaches 100 degrees; it avoids storing the bathtubs at high temperature above 80 degrees too. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbmdyZWVuZ29vZHMuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2JhdGh0dWIvZHJvcC1pbi1iYXRodHViLmh0bWw_" target="_blank">acrylic bathtub</a>

The detergent could be dish detergent. If the stains are difficult to remove by cleaning agents, industrial alcohol could wipe them easily. Under the hot and humid conditions for long time, the bathtubs will breed many bacteria.

We recommend you clean the bathtub regularly and do not use disinfectant randomly, as disinfectant may not be able to kill leaf mold and fungi entirely.
