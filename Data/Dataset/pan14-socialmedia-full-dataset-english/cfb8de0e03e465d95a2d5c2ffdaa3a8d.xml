I feel that track composing a lot more or considerably less is a specific thing that has to arrive from the heart or your physique. There are expert writers, but personally I get the tunes based on all those lyrics pretty tedious. Hope this can produce some concepts and enable you get in the ideal mode for creating your upcoming tune! Best of luck!
