Generally hidden away as the final layer in just about all software architecture, the database is the heart of any web application that will store and access information.<br /><br />Microsoft's SQL Server is among the most top of the line databases which they can display for Enterprise or world-wide-web related applications. It's rapidly, powerful, and has superb integration with all Microsoft products. Unfortunately, it's adoption as some sort of database for small web applications has been restricted till now due to a tiny stumbling block known as Licensing.<br /><br />For normal SQL databases, Microsoft imposes a fee for any entity connected with your database. This was called a client Access License (CAL) and could be processor based, user based, or device dependent. Essentially, it means that will, if you purchased a user based CAL, you would have to pay a fee for any user accessing the data source and for device based CAL's, a license fee would have to be paid for each device accessing the database inspite of the user.<br /><br />This is reasonable in Enterprise applications just a company, but is some sort of killer for small world-wide-web applications.<br /><br />Web applications together with database licensing problems. <br /><br />Each time a database is accessed by the web application, there is usually no limit on how many users can access this database. Thus, user based CAL's are not possible. The same goes with regard to device based CAL's as you're can't pay for just about every computer out there using the web. Therefore, that leaves us with Processor based CAL's where you cover each processor (real bodily or virtual) that Microsoft's SQL server goes on.<br /><br />However, we learned inside article on the Microsoft Application Request Routing Component, that web applications ought to be scalable. This means that it ought to be easy and cost effective to add or remove resources from your web based system with will. And that comes with processor power.<br /><br />Processor driven CAL's develop into expensive in the long run as your web site grows more and more demanding as you begin to fund each additional CPU that is added. A normal quad core CPU can end up costing you a lot in Licensing fees.<br /><br />Microsoft SQL Server 08 Web Edition. <br /><br />Microsoft's brand-new SQL  http: //www. waysale. com/microsoft_windows_server_2008_datacenter-32_64-bit_license_and_media-oem-2_processor-pc web edition has been specially made for small company that need to save cash in cost. Essentially, it will allow you to run a SQL server database on up to 4 CPU's at an exceptionally low cost with unlimited database size and memory.<br /><br />This database license can only be used for web based applications and has now special technological features that optimize it for this purpose such as administration equipment and tight integration using. NET technologies.<br /><br />Since you can find no limitations on it's growth in addition to the 4 CPU's, the standard CAL scheme of licensing does not apply to the SQL server world-wide-web edition. Since the overall cost is low, even small start-ups are able to to use this powerful database.<br /><br />Currently, what usually happens is that businesses for a budget start off with a free RDBMS like MySQL as a proof of concept and suffer later right after they need a more specialized database like MSSQL since that migration is not easy (no matter how abstracted the database is).<br /><br />With the web edition, they can start using MSSQL immediately and reap some great benefits of the ease of make use of and programming integration from day one. &amp;nbsp;
