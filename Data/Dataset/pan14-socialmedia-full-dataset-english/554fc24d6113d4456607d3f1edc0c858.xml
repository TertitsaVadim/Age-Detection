<br />:]]
<br /><br />scene kid equals someone who runs around changing who they are because of what everyones talking about, whats supposed to be cool or what will get them the most attention they go with the scene of things HENCE THE NAME!!
<br /><br />they also do exactly what the stereotype says that whatever there trying to be is. Like take emo for example the stereotype (which is completely wrong by the way) says that an emo must have a fringe were skinnys dress all in black where band t-shirts have a mail back listen to MCR, be depressed write a diary, slit there wrists and cry for hours. A scene kid would do exactly that and be exactly that.
<br /><br />I'm so sick of people running around calling them selves scene and saying its another form of emo ITS FUCKING NOT!!!
<br /><br />If you call ur self scene there a fucking try hard and thats what you have been calling yourself all this time. Now you should go burn and die
<br />:]]
<br /><br />Example of a scene kid:
<br />This kid at the start of the year was skater as skating was the in thing and everyone was doing it.
<br />But then gangstas came into the lime light and he was no longer skater but a Gangsta.
<br />Then everyone started to gossip about Gothics and they were given a lot of attention so this kid all of a sudden became Gothic
<br />But then everyone stopped talking about Gothics so he said &quot;oh being Gothic just is int for me&quot; and moved back to a gangsta
<br />But then everyone started talking about emos and holy shit what do u know he is now emo everyone.
<br />But then we went back to school the next year and what do you know he wasn't emo anymore cos no one was talking about them anymore.
<br />So do the world a favor and stop fucking calling your self scene your just embarrassing yourself by calling yourself a try hard

<br />is life there to be lived??
<br />or is it there to be destroyed??
<br /><br />are we born to live
<br />yet we live to die??
<br />is life a beautiful creation
<br />or a curse droped down upon us??
<br /><br />is life a miracle that should be treasured
<br />or something that should be throwen away??
<br />should we look after our lifes cos we only have one
<br />or should we party hard??
<br /><br />Life is a barren land full of toxic waste
<br />we must weave through the mine fields
<br />&amp; dodge the falling bombs
<br /><br />we must breathe the poisend air
<br />&amp; choke on our lies
<br />we will bleed the memories
<br />through our heart and in to our eyes
<br /><br />cry the tears of the lost and lonley
<br />lay amoung the dead and forgotten
<br />run through the grave yards of the suicide corpses
<br />we cradle our hearts broken and torn
<br />we die slowly and die young
<br />burried in this earth
<br />covered in our blood
<br />that we have shed
<br /><br />every breath we take
<br />is a silent scream
<br />every laugh we create
<br />just a desprete plea for help
<br />every smile we fake
<br />just another scar of the life thats been deemed
<br /><br />Life is a battle that i have lost
<br />Nothing feels good nothing feels right
<br />so as i put this gun to my head
<br />i whisper im not alright

<br />the rain poor down on me
<br />so angry so fierce
<br />it washes away the lies and past of my life
<br /><br />I watch my blood mix with the tears of a broken heart
<br />i cradle my heart it stains my chest
<br />so much hurt this pain will not end
<br /><br />lying in a pool of my own flesh bones
<br />i relise im a lost cause
<br />to far gone to hear my screams for help
<br />i walk along the graveyeard of the tradgic suicides
<br /><br />so i sit and wait for my judgement day
<br />to weak and tired to carry on
<br />no strength left in my sole
<br />your knife ran through it with no signs of stoping.
<br /><br />its a work in progress

<br />I mean not only do we have to deal with the stress and horrors of facing our last year of schooling and the rest of our lives, i mean as if thats not enough, all the emotional issues and complications of being a teenager seem to be at the very peak. Everywhere i turn problems are happening things are changing and there changing for ever, its scary knowing i can never go back to when things where simple and that my life will forever be changing and seiese to be as i know it. All of this is reall quite daunting and i just want to abort to fetal position, shut out the world and cry.

<br /><strong>i </strong>am becoming a <em>nun</em> seriously. 
<br />I <strong>wont have to deal with boys</strong> and there fucking shit they <em>put me through</em>. 
<br />I c<strong>an not believe my ex</strong> tells <em>me im immature</em> because i said i <em>don't want anything to do with him</em>
<br />after <strong>everything</strong> he put me through <strong>how</strong> could he even <strong>possible</strong> <em>think that it was okay</em> to contact me? and that there was <strong>any chance</strong> in hell that i would be okay with it and that i would <em>want to talk to him</em>? 
<br />He <strong>hasnt changed</strong> one fucking bit, still the <strong>insenstitve fucker </strong>who thinks he <em>can do anything</em> he wants and not bear the <strong>consequences.</strong>
<br />Well i got <strong>news for you Mr</strong>. this is <strong>one ex</strong> who you <strong>can not</strong> string along.
<br />He should have thought about the fact he would <em>hate not talking</em> to me <strong>before</strong> he l<strong>ied, cheated, hurt me and fucked me over.</strong>. 
<br />Then <strong>on top of that</strong>, i was kinda '<em>seeing'</em> this guy who i just recently told that i didn't want it to go any further cos <strong>i'm not ready</strong> for a serious relationship <strong>again</strong> so <em>soon after.</em>
<br />ive told him <em>so many times</em> and <em>all the reasons</em> <strong>why</strong> i don't want one over and over and over again but he <strong>continues</strong> to tell me how much <strong>he likes me</strong> and how much <em>he wants to be with me</em>. 
<br /><strong>WTF! </strong> way to go to make me feel like a <strong>heartless bitch</strong>.
<br />I mean what does he <em>think</em> it was going to <strong>achive</strong>? its not going to <strong>change</strong> my mind and then when i tell him that for the <strong>billionth</strong> time he gets <strong>angry</strong> and has a go at me?? <em>I just have the right <strong>fucking knack</strong> of picking the boys to date don't i</em>? for fucks sake &gt;:|</span>

The fucking nerve he has asking me to forgive him, like he thought that that was even an option, the fact the he thought that there was even the slightest chance that i was going to forgive him outstands me, i can't believe he is that full of himself that he actually thought he could get away with it. WELL FUCK YOU! that is not going to happen if you wanted to be friends and me to forgive you because you miss me, that aint my fucking problem. You should have thought about that before you fucked me over, go play in traffic or rot in hell im not fussed anything painful to your persons &gt;:|
