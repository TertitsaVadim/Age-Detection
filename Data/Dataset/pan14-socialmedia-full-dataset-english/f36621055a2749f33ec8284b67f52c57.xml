<br />I pray for a woman who's partially gay
<br />One whos pretty sexy and bright
<br />One whos fanny is small and tight
<br />Oh send me a woman who goes like a train
<br />Who swallows load and wants it again
<br />And as she prays with this in mind
<br />She will ask me to take her from behind
<br />And when im done ill climb off and thank her
<br />But untill you can find her .........
<br /><br />ill just be a wanker !!!!!!

<br />You're the finger in my glove
<br />You're the gear stick in my gearbox
<br />My god this must be love
<br /><br />In my engine you're the piston
<br />You're the toothpaste in my tube
<br />The zucchini in my fettuccini
<br />Oh I'm so in love with you 
<br /><br />You're the rat inside my drainpipe
<br />You're the log that burns my fire
<br />The banana in my smoothie
<br />Yes it's you that I desire
<br /><br />You're the bottle in my cooler
<br />The plunger in my loo
<br />Your torpedo fills my submarine
<br />Yes my darling I love you
<br /><br />You are my phallic lover
<br />We are a perfect fit
<br />I'd like to do some things with you
<br />If you'd be up to it?
<br /><br />So take me back to your place 
<br />And we can have some fun
<br />It feels just right to hold you tight
<br />As we two become as one.

<br /><br />you hear a door close .. you aint going to like what happening on the other side !
<br /><br />you hear the toilet flush .. you,ve lost something that they should'nt of had!
<br /><br />you buy a bulk pack of loo rolls it was false economy!
<br /><br />you hear that sreech, you know the one thats ear piercing? you are going to be in A &amp; E for most of the day
<br /><br />there is an unearthly slience, they must be miles away!
<br /><br />The phone rings at school time , your in trouble!
<br /><br />they ask for a specific thing for tea, they meant the other !
<br /><br />the cats wearing your underwear, your wardrobes emptied on the floor
<br /><br />you loose something , forget it you'll never ever find it !
<br /><br />Once you've sorted upstairs, you'll be back up there within 10 mins doing it again !
<br /><br />And sometimes you just wish that someone had come up with roll on aerosols and invisable talc!
<br /><br />But you also know that when at the end of the day you get that really hard squeeze and wet kiss that they really do mean it <img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/love.gif" alt=":)" />

<br />If I happened to show up on your door step crying, would you 
<br />care? 
<br />If I called you and asked you to pick me up because something 
<br />happened, would you come? 
<br />If I had one day left, to live my life; would you be part of 
<br />that last day? 
<br />If I needed a shoulder to cry on, would you give me yours? 
<br /><br />A friend sent me this the other day, kinda touched me , a friend ive never met but chat with alot on phone through text,email ect a friend who for the past year keep saying were going to meet but never quite there 
<br /><br />Tonight that friend is in hospital fighting for his life, his chances are very slim , dont give out much hope he will make the weekend ........
<br /><br />Lifes too short for silly bickering, get out there and grab the bull by the horns
<br />dont do what i feel i have and miss out on 
<br /><br />wish i could turn back time .........
