<br /><br />One of the best rivalries will be renewed this Monday in Chicago as the Green Bay Packers play the Chicago Bears.
<br /><br />Green Bay (5-9) has been eliminated from postseason play and has not won in a month. Their last victory came against Chicago when they totally dominated the Bears 37-3 on November 16 at Lambeau Field. The game was not the turning point in the season that Green Bay had hoped. After the victory, the Packers evened their record at 5-5 and were still very much in the thick of the NFC North Division race. Since then they have lost four straight contests in excruciating fashion.
<br /><br />Immediately following the Bears game, the Packers engaged the Saints in a close battle with much scoring throughout the first-half. But New Orleans blew it open in the second-half and claimed victory 51-29. The next three weeks, the Packers have lost each game by no more than four points.
<br /><br />Chicago (8-6) has had a solid season after dropping to last in the division last season after their Super Bowl season of 2006, however the Bears do not control their own destiny. The Minnesota Vikings have had a very solid second-half and sit in an advantageous position over Chicago. Win just one of their final two games and the Vikings will clinch the division no matter what the Bears do.
<br /><br />Either way Chicago must win and they should be ready to avenge that loss to a Green Bay team searching for answers.
<br /><br />Even if the Bears fail to make the playoffs, they know they will be able to compete with the Vikings in the future as far as talented and young running backs is concerned. Matt Forte is the favorite for the Rookie of the Year award, won last year by Minnesota's Adrian Peterson. Forte needs 69 yards in his last two contests to surpass the Bears' highest rookie running back yardage total of 1183 set by Anthony Thomas in 2001.
<br /><br />Before the season the Packers back Ryan Grant was seen to be in elite company with Peterson, but he has had a tough season. However, he did have his best game against Chicago with 145 yards. Grant loves playing the Bears, as he has garnered 100 yards or more in both of his career starts against them.
<br /><br />Even with the loss earlier this season, the Bears have won six of the last nine over the Packers, but have held home field very well in the series, having split the last four at Soldier Field.

<br /><br />The best of the early bowl games will take place on Christmas Eve-Eve, Tuesday night, December 23, as number 11 TCU will take on number nine Boise State in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego.
<br /><br />Two seasons ago, Boise State (12-0) was the BCS buster. In arguably one of the best BCS games in the last few years, the Broncos used a number of trick plays to upset the old guard of college football, Oklahoma a few seasons ago. Boise State did not receive the amount of love they should have probably been shown for the entertainment value they would bring to the BCS games, frequently full of blowouts and mismatches and will, instead go to San Diego for an early bowl game.
<br /><br />Boise State did everything they could to try to nab a BCS berth this season. They won all 12 of their games by an average of 27.2 points, but saw Utah get the coveted, non-BSC conference spot in the Sugar Bowl. The Broncos had a shot to land in the Fiesta Bowl, but the game decided to pick Ohio State instead, despite being ranked lower.
<br /><br />The Broncos will face a worthy opponent in TCU (10-2) who won double-digit games in the regular season largely on the backs of their second-ranked defense in the nation. The Horned Frogs only lost to number two Oklahoma and number 10 Utah along the way. TCU will look to use their stellar defense to stop Boise State's 12th-ranked offense which yields 39.4 points per game.
<br /><br />The Frogs meanwhile are holding opponents to 10.9 points per contest, second only to Southern California's 7.8 points per game. Their offense if none to shabby either. They have five players with 400 yards rushing and hold onto the ball longer than anyone in the nation at 34:50. These factors will be critical in beating Boise State.
<br /><br />The teams have met only once before, also in a bowl game. The Boise State upset the 19th-ranked TCU 34-31 in the 2003 Fort Worth Bowl.
<br /><br />This will be the Broncos ninth bowl appearance, having won five of those. The Horned Frogs will appear in their 25th bowl game. In the previous 24, they have gone 10-13-1.

<br />Chippewas -7 vs. Owls
<br /><br />They had them right where they wanted them. Central Michigan, champions of the Mid-American Conference two years running was playing the team that wanted their title, in the snow, in Mount Pleasant. Yet the, then, undefeated Ball State Cardinals weathered both the winter storm and the Chippewa storm en route to a 34-21 victory. The loss sealed CMU's fate within their conference. They would not repeat as champions, but circumstances came into play that sent Central to their third straight Motor City Bowl. They will take on legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger and Florida Atlantic at Ford Field in Detroit the day after Christmas.
<br /><br />When Buffalo handed Ball State a devastating loss in the MAC Championship Game, also played in Detroit, it muddied up the MAC bowl picture. Throughout it's 12-year history, the Motor City Bowl has usually been the reward for the champion of the conference. But even though Buffalo won the MAC Championship, it made much more sense for them to head a few miles north to Toronto for the International Bowl on January 3rd. This opened up the door for Ball State to head to the Motor City Bowl, but the MAC and the bowl game decided to allow the Cardinals to have a better matchup with Tulsa in the GMAC Bowl to be held in Mobile, Alabama on January 6, so the door swung open for the Chippewas (8-4).
<br /><br />CMU enjoyed its fourth straight winning season and earned a third straight trip to a bowl game, even though its regular season ended in the disappointment of Ball State and an upset loss to Eastern Michigan on the final game of the regular season. The Central Michigan Chippewas will attempt to avoid a three-game losing streak for the first time since October 2004.
<br /><br />Much was expected of Schnellenberger and the Owls this season after winning the Sun Belt Conference last year, but a devastating 1-5 start seemed to seal their fate. But the team responded by winning five of their last six games. During the stretch Florida Atlantic averaged 35 points and defeated Florida International 57-50 in overtime to win their final game and become bowl eligible.
<br /><br />The bowl game may be one of the more entertaining early bowl games because both teams feature potent offenses. Dan LeFevour and Central are ranked third in the MAC with 253.1 passing yards and 24th in the nation with 427.1 yards per contest. The Owls' Rusty Smith led his conference with 2918 yards and 22 scores.
<br /><br />This will be the first all-time meeting between the schools.
<br /><br />This will be CMU's fifth bowl appearance, having gone 1-3 in previous appearances, including last year's last second 51-48 loss to Purdue in last year's Motor City Bowl. FAU went to their first bowl game last season and beat Memphis in the New Orleans Bowl. Coach Schnellenberger is 5-0 all-time in bowl games with FAU, Miami and Louisville.

<br />Mountaineers -1 1/2 vs. Tar Heels
<br /><br />North Carolina is beautiful this time of year, but Miami after New Years is even better. While both West Virginia and North Carolina can celebrate solid seasons by playing each other in the Meineke Bowl on December 27, they both know it could have been so much more.
<br /><br />Both teams went 2-2 in their last four contests which prevented them from residing at the top of their conferences, where they both sat before the final stretch of the season. If they would have held on, the teams would have met in the Orange Bowl.
<br /><br />For West Virginia (8-4), the losses were particularly tough. After winning five straight from September 27-November 1, the Mountaineers losses and wins to their conference foes the final four games of the year. They lost a second straight year to their rivals from Pittsburgh and also dropped a contest to Rutgers. Both of those losses were by a combined seven points.
<br /><br />Nonetheless the Mountaineers had a solid season in a transition year which saw Bill Stewart replace Rich Rodriguez as head coach. Stewart, a native of West Virginia, was named interim head coach when Rodriguez left for Ann Arbor prior to last season's Fiesta Bowl. Stewart led his team to a 48-28 upset of Oklahoma, a participant in this year's national championship game. One day after the victory, Stewart lost the &quot;interim&quot; tag in his title.
<br /><br />North Carolina (8-4) was 7-2 after nine games and they were not defeating patsies by any means, having posted victories over Connecticut, Boston College and Georgia Tech, all Top 25 teams. Each of those games, they won by 22.6 points. After their .500 stretch run, which included a final game victory over archrival Duke, the Tar Heels tied Miami for third in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Still it was quite a turnaround for Butch Davis' team, who finished 4-8 a season ago.
<br /><br />These teams have met only once, in the 1997 Gator Bowl, with North Carolina winning 20-13 to finish their season 11-1 under then head coach Mack Brown.
<br /><br />This will be North Carolina's 26th bowl game, but first since the 2004 Continental Tire Bowl. The Tar Heels will be looking for their first victory since they beat Auburn in the 2001 Peach Bowl. They have a 12-13 bowl record. West Virginia is 12-15 in their previous bowl games and have won three straight.

<br />Seminoles -5 1/2 vs. Badgers
<br /><br />A few years back an American television network produced some low-budget pieces involving rabid animals, out of control cars and other wacky activities and behavior. These shows were usually called, &quot;When Animals Attack&quot; or a reasonable facsimile. If someone produces a movie about this past year's University of Wisconsin season, it should be named, &quot;When Good Seasons Go Wrong.&quot;
<br /><br />On September 27, the 3-0 Badgers visited Ann Arbor to take on the hapless Wolverines. They raced out to an 18-0 lead and put on cruise control until Michigan began climbing back into the game late in the third quarter. The end result was a stunning 27-25 loss when a holding call erased a game-tying two-point conversion. The game seemed to demoralize Wisconsin as they dropped their next four and five out of the following six.
<br /><br />The week following the Michigan loss, the Badgers faced off against the Buckeyes in Columbus and once again watched a late lead evaporate into a loss. Over one month later, on November 1, as Wisconsin tried to build on their first victory since September 13 the week before, the Badgers once again blew a late fourth quarter lead and watched the Spartans kick a game-winning field goal in East Lansing.
<br /><br />Yet coach Brett Bielema was able to get his players to play hard down the stretch to win three straight, become bowl eligible and achieve a 7-5 season, something unthinkable during the Badger's losing skid. Their reward for the turnaround is a December 27th trip to Orlando to take on Florida State in the Champs Sports Bowl.
<br /><br />The Seminoles (8-4) was the opposite of the Badgers. Florida State played well the first half of the season but stumbled their way down the stretch, landing in this bowl game. Florida State is now appearing in their third-straight non-January 1st (or later) bowl game after 15 straight years of going to January 1st (or later) Bowl games. The good news for Florida State, however, they now own the longest bowl streak at 27, after Michigan's lousy season broke their streak of 33.
<br /><br />These teams have never met before.
<br /><br />This will be Wisconsin's 20th bowl game. They have gone 10-9 in the previous 19, including last season's Outback Bowl loss to Tennessee. This will be Florida State's 37th postseason affair, having gone 20-14-2. They were defeated by Kentucky in last season's Music City Bowl.

<br />Golden Bears -8 vs. Hurricanes
<br /><br />Miami was flying high and ranked for the first time in a number of years as they won their fifth in a row over Virginia Tech on November 13. With a 7-3 record and two games remaining, the Hurricanes were looking for possibly a New Years Day bowl game. Perhaps they were looking too hard because they dropped their final two games to Georgia Tech and North Carolina State, both on the road, by an average of nearly 15 points. Miami finished 7-5 and is headed to the Emerald Bowl at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco to take on the California Golden Bears on December 27.
<br /><br />Meanwhile, at 6-4, California's season looked in peril prior to their final two games of the season. They had lost any shot at the PAC-10 title and were facing opponents whose seasons could be defined by an upset of the Bears. But Cal crushed their final two opponents, Stanford and Washington, by an average of 31 points to finish at 8-4 and be allowed the ability to take the short trip to San Francisco for their sixth straight postseason appearance.
<br /><br />Jahvid Best was vital to the Bears throttling of their Pac-10 opponents by rushing for 201 yards and three touchdowns in a 37-16 win against the Cardinal. If that performance was not enough the sophomore running back set a school record in the final game of the season with 311 rushing yards and four scores to help the Beats whip the Huskies 48-7.
<br /><br />With its proximity to Berkeley, this game will have the look and feel of a Cal home game, which is a distinct advantage for the Bears who won all seven of their home games this year. Miami was a so-so 3-3.
<br /><br />The Hurricanes season ending skid cost them a chance at the ACC title game. Their defense, in particular, let them down as they allowed a combined 691 yards in the final two losses. This flew directly in the face of the type of defense Miami boasted all season. Through their first seven games, the Hurricanes allowed only two opponents to rush for 100 yards, yet Georgia Tech ran for 472 yards in a 41-23 victory over Miami and NC State ran for a troubling 219 yards on the ground in a 38-28 win for the Wolfpack.
<br /><br />Still the Miami Hurricanes have to be happy with the turnaround they achieved from last year's disappointing 5-7 season. This will be Miami's 23rd postseason appearance in 26 seasons and 32nd bowl game overall. They have a 18-13 record and won their last bowl game, the MPC Computers Bowl, on New Years Eve 2006 over Nevada. California has been to 18 bowl games, going 9-8-1. In their five straight bowl appearances prior to this season, the Bears have gone 4-1, including last season's victory over Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl.
<br /><br />The teams have not met since a home-and-home series over two years in 1989 and 1990 with Miami claming both games. Prior to that, they had met once before, back in 1964, which was Cal's only win in the short series.

<br /><br />The bowl season unofficially wraps up with the GMAC Bowl on Tuesday, January 6th in Mobile, Alabama as the Ball State Cardinals take on the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. This is the last &quot;bowl game&quot; before the BSC Championship game to be held in Miami two days later and one of the teams, Ball State, has as many losses as both teams in the championship game.
<br /><br />Even if they won out, Ball State (12-1) would not have been in the national title picture and perhaps not even in a BCS game. All those questions were moot when the Cardinals were destroyed in the Mid-American Championship Game held December 5th in Detroit. Ball State literally fumbled away their chance at a better bowl game when they let go of the ball four times, two of which were ran back for scores and the other two were turned into touchdowns in a 42-24 loss to Buffalo which dropped the Cardinals ten spots to number 22.
<br /><br />Star quarterback Nate Davis had a lousy game throwing an interception and was a part of all four fumbles. Davis has decided to stick around for another season after throwing for 3446 yards, 26 touchdowns and seven interceptions.
<br /><br />While one key member of the best Ball State team in decades is sticking around, the head man, coach Brady Hoke is gone. Hoke accepted the position of head coach at San Diego State and chose not to be on the sidelines for the GMAC Bowl. A interim coach for the game has not yet been announced.
<br /><br />David Johnson had an equally outstanding season at quarterback for Tulsa (10-3). Both quarterbacks involved in this game rank in the top 10 in passing efficiency. The Golden Hurricane were runners-up in the Conference USA this season, having lost the title game to East Carolina on December 6th.
<br /><br />This is the first meeting between the programs.
<br /><br />Tulsa is playing in their fourth straight bowl game, winning last year's GMAC Bowl 63-7 over Bowling Green. That was the largest margin of a victory in a bowl game ever. This will be Ball State's second straight postseason contest, but they have not fared well in bowl games. They have yet to win one in six attempts, including last year's 52-30 loss to Rutgers in the International Bowl.

<br /><br />Controversy and the BCS seem to go together like cookies and milk. Once again there is an outcry over Oklahoma getting the nod with an identical record as Texas, even though the Longhorns beat the Sooners. If head-to-head matchups do not count, why bother playing the games is the sentiment of many college football fans, particular located around Austin, Texas.
<br /><br />But the game is what it is and it is still a terrific matchup of traditional college football powers meeting for the first time ever as Florida meets up with Oklahoma in Miami on Thursday, January 6th.
<br /><br />Two Heisman Trophy winners will match up as this year's winner Sam Bradford will take on runner-up and last year's winner Tim Tebow. Bradford was tops in the country with 48 touchdown passes against only six picks. Tebow was almost equally as solid with 2515 yards, 28 touchdowns and only two interceptions. He also rushed for 12 scores on the ground.
<br /><br />The Gators will be attempting to win their second title in three seasons and third overall title, while the Sooners are looking for their eight national title and first since 2000. The team made the championship game in 2004 and 2005, losing both times.
<br /><br />The controversy surrounding Oklahoma's placement in this game takes a hit when it is shown that the Sooners (12-1) scored 58 points or more in each of its last six games, including posting 65 on the former number two team in the nation, Texas Tech. That stretch of offensive fireworks has not been seen since Tulsa had a similar run in 1919.
<br /><br />Florida (12-1) weathered an early head-scratching loss to Ole Miss to win their final nine games and dispatched number one and undefeated Alabama in the SEC championship game.
<br /><br />For the Sooners to claim victory, they will have to weather the Gators homefield advantage. While roughly 330 miles separates Gaineville and Dolphins Stadium, with all apologies to the Seminoles and Hurricanes, Florida is Gatorcountry, at least for this past decade. Making more comforting surroundings is the fact that the Gators have 13 players from or near Miami. A year ago, Ohio State was unable to weather the home-state advantage LSU held in the Superdome, roughly 76 miles from Baton Rouge.

<br />Detroit -260 vs. Dallas
<br /><br />The second rematch of the season of last spring's Western Conference Final will take place in Joe Louis Arena Thursday night as the Detroit Red Wings look to avenge a loss earlier this season to the Dallas Stars.
<br /><br />The rematch is not what is seemed in May. While the Red Wings (27-7-5) are on their usual winning clip, the Stars (17-16-5) have sunk to the bottom of their division. The two rivals sit separated by twenty points in the conference standings.
<br /><br />Detroit is on pace for 124 points but have been winning games in much different ways than it was a year ago and in the Stanley Cup playoffs last spring. A year ago, the Wings have up the league's fewest goals, at 2.82 per game. But injuries and lackluster play from Chris Osgood has helped balloon that mark and pushed Detroit to the middle of the pack in GAA.
<br /><br />The bright spot in net for the Red Wings has been backup Ty Conklin who has gone 6-1-1 with a 1.86 GAA since December 18th. Conklin became the answer to the future trivia question of being a starting goalie in each of the first three regular-season outdoor hockey games. After beating Chicago 6-4 on New Years Day, the goaltender improved his record to 2-1 outdoors.
<br /><br />Currently the Stars are only one point above last place Los Angeles in the Pacific Division, but a big victory over a good team can turn around their season quite quickly. Despite their troubles this year, Dallas is only four points out of the eighth and final playoff spot.
<br /><br />They have played well of late, going 6-2-1 in their last nine contests, including a shootout victory in Vancouver in their last game Sunday night.
<br /><br />Marty Turco is quite familiar to Joe Louis Arena. He played college hockey just up the road in Ann Arbor for the University of Michigan and regularly took part in CCHA games in Detroit's hockey venue. Turco has not fared well at Joe Louis Arena since becoming a pro, winning only once, in Game 5 of the conference final. Overall Turco has posted a 3-10-0 record and a 2.78 GAA in his career against Detroit, including a 3-1 home victory on December 12th.
<br /><br />Detroit won the first three games of the Western Conference Final last spring before taking the series in six. The Red Wings took three of the four regular season matchups last year.

<br />Chicago -165 vs. Colorado
<br /><br />If it were not for the pesky Detroit Red Wings, the Chicago Blackhawks would be the talk of hockey. Before facing the defending Stanley Cup Champions two out of three days in a home-and-home series, including New Years Day's Winter Classic held in Wrigley Field, the Blackhawks had won nine straight games. Detroit handed them a two-game losing streak for the first time since the end of November and put some distance between them and the rising Hawks.
<br /><br />Chicago had been dominant since the beginning of December, going 12-3. All three losses were to, you guessed it, the Detroit Red Wings.
<br /><br />Since the home-and-home against the Wings, Chicago (22-8-7) has taken their frustration out on two teams, the first place Calgary Flames and the Phoenix Coyotes.
<br /><br />They especially took it to the Coyotes in their last game on Tuesday. The Blackhawks built up an insurmountable 4-0 lead five minutes into the first period. Jonathan Towes would then add two goals en route to a 6-0 decimation.
<br /><br />The victory gave the Blackhawks a positive start to their three game road trip, which will continue Thursday night in Denver when they face the Avalanche. Once again Chicago will be without leading scorer Patrick Kane who was injured in the December 30th loss at Joe Louis Arena. He is listed as day-to-day with an ankle injury, but is expected to sit out one more contest before returning in Nashville on Saturday.
<br /><br />Injuries are nothing new for Colorado (20-19-1). Joe Sakic has not played since November and looks to be out until March as he underwent surgery on Wednesday to repair a herniated disk. Another of their top centers, Paul Stastny, is out until the end of February because of a fractured forearm suffered on December 23rd.
<br /><br />The injuries have forced Coach Tony Granato into moving personnel around. Granato moved Wojtek Wolski to center from his usual spot on the wing in their last game at Nashville. The bold move paid off as the Colorado Avalanche snapped a three-game skid and won 2-1.
<br /><br />Chicago has won both meetings this season, 6-2 in the United Center on November 3rd and 4-3 at the Pepsi Center on December 12th. The Blackhawks have won five out of the last six over the Avalanche.

<br />Dallas -8 vs. New York
<br /><br />A once promising season for the New York Knicks now resembles many of their seasons of the last decade. The NBA and fans of the Knicks hopeful of a renaissance in Madison Square Garden may have spoke to soon as New York has dropped eight out of their last ten.
<br /><br />Some hope was reborn with New York (13-20) defeated Boston on Sunday, but the fact that the Celtics have been losing to everyone lately and the Knicks followed that victory with a devastating loss to the doormat of the NBA, the Oklahoma City Thunder, 107-99, on Tuesday. Any hope was deflated.
<br /><br />Thursday the Knicks can attempt their next rise from the ashes as they travel to Dallas to take on the Mavericks. It will be quite the uphill battle for New York who has not won in eight trips to Dallas, their last road win was in 1999. The Mavericks (21-13) also look to wrap up the two-game season sweep, having beaten the Knicks at MSG 124-114 in overtime on November 16th. A victory Thursday will give the Mavericks nine straight victories over the Knicks and victories in 14 of the last 15 matchups between the teams.
<br /><br />Dallas continues their stretch against some of the weaker teams in the league and while they have been victorious in most games, they have struggled, including overcoming double-digit deficits in wins over Minnesota and Philadelphia and a 20 point loss to the cellar dwelling Memphis Grizzlies.
<br /><br />Tuesday the Dallas Mavericks rebounded with a 107-102 home victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Dirk Nowitzki blocked a shot and nailed the game winner with under a minute to play. Dallas has now 11-2 in their last 13 home games. Still Dallas had to go on an 11-1 run to come back and win.

<br />Hawkeyes vs. Golden Gophers
<br /><br />The number 22 Golden Gophers of Minnesota are no longer in the ranks of the nation's unbeaten masses, but they are still off to their best start in 12 years. Two games ago, Minnesota was beaten at home by, then-number 10, Michigan State, but rebounded to a victory against Ohio State 68-59 last Saturday. But now the Gophers will set off on an odyssey of which they are unfamiliar with: the road.
<br /><br />Unbelievably at this point in the season, Minnesota (13-1, 1-1) has played only one road game at Colorado State on November 22nd, a 72-71 victory. Thursday night they will travel to rival Iowa for their first road conference game and they will feature a team that has not lost at home in nine tries.
<br /><br />You would have to look hard in the Minnesota records to find a season when they started this well. That is because the last time that they did, 15-1 at the start of 1996-97, the records were expunged because of NCAA sanctions, which wiped a Final Four appearance off of the books.
<br /><br />The Gophers are residents of the Top 25 for the first time since 2002. They have done it with a balance offensive attack which scores 73.1 points per game, but the production is spread around because Minnesota has only one player in the top 25 scorers within the Big Ten. Lawrence Westbrook is the lone representative with 13 points per contest.
<br /><br />The Iowa Hawkeyes's promising start has been derailed by alternating wins and losses over their last five games. They will look to win two straight for the first time in about a month after beating Indiana 65-60 last Saturday. The Hawkeyes (11-4) remained perfect at home by defeating the Hoosiers. At home, Iowa is holding opponents to a mere 50.6 points and 37.7 percent shooting. On the season, both home and away, Iowa is holding opponents to 55.9 points per game, good for a place in the top 10 in the country.
<br /><br />Minnesota is technically 2-0 on the road this season, having also beaten, then-number nine, Louisville at the neutral site of Glendale, Arizona on December 20th. A season ago, the Gophers were 4-8 on the road last season and have dropped their last four and seven of eight at Iowa.

<br />Tennessee -3 vs. Baltimore
<br /><br />Two one-time division rivals will meet up in the playoffs for the third time. If it is anything like the previous two, it will be quite a show. The red-hot Baltimore Ravens will meet up with the rested Tennessee Titans in Nashville Saturday afternoon in a matchup of two of the best defenses in the NFL.
<br /><br />For the Titans (13-3), this matchup is a painful déjà vu of 2000 when the team finished 13-3, just like this season; clinched home-field advantage, just like this season and faced the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round, just like this season. Baltimore won, just like this season? Tennessee certainly hopes not.
<br /><br />The teams also met in 2003, when the heavily-favored, AFC North champion Ravens went down in the first round to the wild-card Titans.
<br /><br />This game will be played in the present and the present squads did meet up on October 5th in Baltimore (12-5), with the Titans improving to 5-0 en route to a 10-0 start with a 13-10 victory. The game went down to 1:56 remaining for the game to be decided as Kerry Collins hooked up with Alge Crumpler for a game-winning 11-yard touchdown.
<br /><br />Most expect a game like that to repeat itself as the Titans and Ravens have two of the best defenses in the NFL and that was seen in their Week 5 game as both offenses combined for 495 yards and committed 21 penalties for 169 yards.
<br /><br />The suffocating defenses are near the tops in the NFL and not separated by much. Tennessee ranks second in scoring defense with 14.6 points per game. Not to far behind is Baltimore, ranked third with 15.3. In total yards, Baltimore was second with 277.1 and Tennessee was tied for fifth at 277.1.
<br /><br />The Titans could be even more dangerous if Albert Haynesworth can come back as planned. The All-Pro defensive tackle is day-to-day, but had targeted this game to come back after missing the final two regular season games and resting up through last week's bye week. Also on the mend is defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch, who is recovering from an injured groin and could be back for the first time in a month.
<br /><br />Collins doesn't have to be outstanding given Tennessee's running game. The Titans averaged 137.4 yards per game led by Chris Johnson and LenDale White, who combined for 2,001 yards and 24 touchdowns. White rushed for a career-high 15 touchdowns this season.
<br /><br />While Tennessee rested, the Ravens hit on all cylinders when they beat the AFC-East champion Dolphins in Miami 27-9. They forced a usually steady Miami defense into four Chad Pennington interceptions en route to victory. Rookie Joe Flacco was not particularly sharp, but he did not have to be as he threw 9 of 23 for 135 yards and a touchdown on the ground.
<br /><br />The teams have split 18 meetings, with Tennessee winning three of the last four; however five of the last six have had a margin of victory of six points or less.

<br />Carolina -9 1/2 vs. Arizona
<br /><br />After the joy of the first home playoff victory in their franchise since 1947 and two home cities ago, the Arizona Cardinals realized where the divisional round would take them: the dreaded Eastern time zone against a team who has not lost at home this season. Arizona will travel to travel to Charlotte, North Carolina for a second time this season when they take on the Panthers Saturday night.
<br /><br />The Cardinals (10-7) were 0-5 in the East this season. They lost to Washington, the Jets, Philadelphia and New England by an average of 24 points. Arizona has won 2 games in their last 22 trips into the Eastern time zone.
<br /><br />They played a bit better in their Week 8 trip to Carolina (12-4), but still lost 27-23. Arizona actually held a commanding 17-3 lead in the third quarter of that contest until Carolina rallied to take the lead. Arizona drove to Carolina's 15-yard line late in the fourth quarter in an attempt to regain the lead until Kurt Warner was intercepted by Jon Beason, the Panthers All-Pro linebacker.
<br /><br />The encouraging point for Arizona from that game was the fact that Warner was able to throw for 381 yards against Carolina's defense, which was the second highest total a quarterback achieved against the Panthers this season. Further, Carolina's secondary has struggled at times this season and will have their hands full with the second best offense in the NFL.
<br /><br />While the Panthers rested, the Cardinals flapped their wings and defeated Atlanta 30-24 to win their first postseason game in a decade. The home victory was actually considered a mild upset because Arizona did not fare well outside of beating up on its own weak division.
<br /><br />The Carolina Panthers have been phenomenal at home this season. They are hoping for the perfect storm of improving to 9-0 and have Philadelphia defeat New York, thus allowing the NFC championship game to be played at Bank of America Stadium. The undefeated home regular season is the Panthers first since they went to their first NFC championship game in 1996. They have won their eight home games by an average of 15.4 points.
<br /><br />While Arizona will rely heavily on their passing game, Carolina will be going up against the running back duo of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. Williams was the third best back in the league with 1515 yards and 18 touchdowns, 16 of which came in the last nine games. Stewart, a rookie out of Oregon, added 836 yards and 10 scores.
<br /><br />The teams have met eight times since Carolina was added as an expansion team in 1995 and the Panthers have won six of those. Arizona has not won since winning in back-to-back seasons in 2001 and 2002.

<br />New York -4 vs. Philadelphia
<br /><br />The New York Giants have to be frightened with this Sunday's matchup with their division-rival Philadelphia Eagles. After all, no one knows you better than a team you face twice per year, but the Giants fright may be in the fact that the Eagles are looking eerily like the 2007 edition of the New York Giants.
<br /><br />The Giants foundered their way through the regular season a year ago and entered the playoffs as a wild-card team. In the divisional round, they face a Dallas Cowboys team that won the NFC East and dominated the league until the last quarter of the year. The Giants who rode a hot streak into postseason play surprisingly dominated the Cowboys and earned a berth in the NFC championship game, which would, of course, later result in a Super Bowl title over the heavily-favored New England Patriots.
<br /><br />The Eagles (10-6-1) have the same record the Giants had a year ago and are in the same fifth seeding which New York resided in. Philadelphia had to be red hot in the final month of the season following a season of ups and downs.
<br /><br />New York (12-4) rested last week after losing three of its final four regular season games. Meanwhile Philadelphia was able to handle the NFC North champion Minnesota Vikings, on the road, 26-14.
<br /><br />The Eagles won four of their last five games to get into the postseason. They seemed to respond after two weeks of negative attention was shown to Philadelphia and their quarterback Donovan McNabb. The veteran was criticized for not understanding the tie rule in the NFL after the Eagles and Bengals played to a Week 10 draw. The following week, the team was thrashed by Baltimore, which resulted in the benching of McNabb.
<br /><br />McNabb responded and so did the Eagles. Philadelphia was able to give New York their only home loss of the season on December 7th, 20-14. McNabb passed for 191 yards and was helped by running back Brian Westbrook's 131 yards rushing and 72 yards receiving, including a 40-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter to seal the victory.
<br /><br />That same week was the same week that may have turned the Giants season around for the negative. Plaxico Burress and Antonio Pierce were involved in a nightclub incident that left Burress with an accidental shotgun wound to his leg. Burress was dismissed from the team and the Giants offense has suffered since.
<br /><br />The offense also struggled in the second half because starting running back Brandon Jacobs was in and out of the lineup due to various injuries. He was forced out at halftime in the December game against Philadelphia but ran for 126 yards and two scores when the Giants dropped the Eagles in Philadelphia 36-31 on November 9th.
<br /><br />Despite the most recent nod going to Philly, New York has won six of the last nine meetings. This will be the fourth time that the rivals have met up in the postseason, with the Philadelphia Eagles winning the last matchup, 23-20 in a January 7, 2007 wild-card contest.

<br />Pittsburgh -6 vs. San Diego
<br /><br />Every NFL playoff matchup this week is a rematch of at least one regular season game. No one game was more intriguing than the last time that San Diego and Pittsburgh met on November 16th.
<br /><br />The first 11-10 game in NFL history will have a rematch Sunday afternoon when the Chargers (9-8) once again travel cross country to Heinz Field. The much maligned Chargers defense held the Steelers out of the end zone, even though Pittsburgh made it inside the red zone three times.
<br /><br />The key game was the first of three straight losses for San Diego and seemed to seal their fate of missing the playoffs. But the Chargers rebounded to win their last four games, finish 8-8 and claim the shaky AFC West crown. Last week, the Chargers were able to show they do belong in the 2008 playoffs by defeating the Indianapolis Colts 23-17 in overtime. The Colts had won nine straight contests coming into the Wild-Card round in Qualcomm Stadium.
<br /><br />The Chargers have scored 34.4 points during its five-game winning streak, even largely without LaDanian Tomlinson. The All-Pro has been hampered by a groin injury and it is unclear whether he will play this week in a very cold Pittsburgh. Still Tomlinson's limited play last week did not stop the offense let by backup back Darren Sproles and his 328 all-purpose yards and 105 rushing yards. Sproles won the game in overtime with a 22-yard gallop.
<br /><br />Sproles will undoubtedly be in for a tougher test when he faces off against the league's number two defense. In the November game, San Diego was held to 66 yards on the ground and Philip Rivers was not much better, contributing only 134 yards and throwing two picks.
<br /><br />The Steelers (12-4) did not fare much better on offense in the earlier game and really struggled down the stretch, scoring eight touchdowns in seven games against teams that would make the playoffs. In their season finale two weeks ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers seemingly got on track by posting 31 points in a shutout victory at Cleveland. Willie Parker was back against the Browns after missing five games and posted 116 yards and a score.
<br /><br />Ben Roethlisberger seemed to regress this season. Last year he had 32 touchdown passes and 11 picks, but was down to 17 scores and four more interceptions. Roethlisberger suffered a concussion against Cleveland and was taken out on a stretcher. Despite always stating he would play this week, Roethlisberger had ongoing headaches last week and didn't pass a post-concussion test until Monday.
<br /><br />The Chargers have also had a bit of drama this week when it was revealed that top receiver Vincent Jackson was arrested under suspicion of a DUI. Jackson had a team best 1,098 yards and will play this week.
<br /><br />It is good news-bad news in San Diego's history playing in the Steel City. The Chargers have won only twice in 15 trips to Pittsburgh, but both victories came in the postseason. The last time these teams met in the postseason was in the AFC championship game in 1995, when the Chargers advanced to their first and only Super Bowl with a 17-13 victory.

<br />Cleveland -4 vs. Boston
<br /><br />The last time that Cleveland and Boston met, the Cavaliers was not yet the elite team they have become and the Celtics were beginning their steamrolling over everyone, including Cleveland. The Cavs were the Celtics first victim in their opening night matchup.
<br /><br />With Boston (29-8) unable to jumpstart themselves out of the doldrums, the Cleveland Cavaliers have taken over the best record in the Eastern Conference and will look for revenge for the October 28th 90-85 road loss to Boston when the teams met up for the first time this season in Cleveland on Friday night.
<br /><br />The Cavaliers (28-6) have climbed the ladder, but have not played their best ball lately, going 2-2 in their last four after winning 25 out of their previous 27 games. Even with both teams not playing their best, most feel this could be the preview of the Eastern Conference Final and would be a marvelous rematch of teams so familiar with each other after last seasons seven-game conference semi-final won by Boston.
<br /><br />Cleveland's 2-2 stretch has come with losses to some of the lesser teams in the NBA. On December 30th, they lost the back half of a home-and-home series with Miami and last Sunday they lost at Washington. They rebounded with a home victory against Charlotte 111-81.
<br /><br />The Celtics are in for a fight if they expect to break their three game losing streak in Cleveland. The Cavaliers remain the lone NBA undefeated team at home, with an 18-0 record. Boston's woes had largely been on the road, but now it has been infiltrating their home arena, TD Banknorth Garden. The Boston Celtics were defeated by Houston in Boston 89-85 in a game in which Boston was held to 11 points in the fourth quarter.
<br /><br />Missing this game will be Cleveland's Zyrdunas Ilgauskas. The center has missed the past three games with a chipped ankle bone and is expected out until February.

<br />Denver -4 vs. Detroit
<br /><br />The blockbuster trade of the NBA season which largely sent Chauncey Billups to Denver from Detroit in exchange for Allen Iverson will be on full display as the teams involved meet up for the first time this season on Friday night.
<br /><br />While Iverson was not around the Mile High City long enough to gain much emotion over this game, his counterpart still has many friends left on the Pistons. Chances are that this game will not have as much meaning for Billups as the rematch in about two months at the Palace of Auburn Hills.
<br /><br />It is hard to argue long-term value of the trade as Iverson is not signed after this season. If the Pistons chose to let Iverson go, it will be seen simply as a move to dump salary and possibly to rebuild the aging core of Detroit on the fly. But Denver has no buyer's remorse with Billups whatsoever.
<br /><br />Denver is in the rarefied air of a 25-12 start, the best in their over 30 year history in the league. Billups had no problem getting used to the environment as he is from Colorado and the Nuggets got the true point guard they have been pining for for years.
<br /><br />Detroit (21-12), on the other hand, is just recently seemed to find their groove. The team sputtered in the first few months with Iverson, but has seemingly found their rhythm with a recent seven-game winning streak. That streak was broken Wednesday night as the Pistons lost in Portland 84-83.
<br /><br />Billups helped the Pistons to arguably their best stretch in franchise history as he led them to six straight trips to the conference finals, the longest streak since the Lakers in the early 1980's.
<br /><br />Once again Carmelo Anthony will be missing for the Nuggets as he recovers from a broken hand.
<br /><br />Not that it matters much as the key cogs of both teams have swapped sides, but Detroit has dominated Denver in recent years, going 8-2 in the last 10 and has won four straight. The Nugget's last victory came in March 2006 in Denver.

<br />Miami -4 vs. Sacramento
<br /><br />In your college days, road trips were the greatest. As a professional athlete-not so much. Thus is the life a player for the Miami Heat. The Heat are one game into a road trip that will take them to seven-cities and will not return to Miami until January 21st.
<br /><br />The road trip has taken some of the momentum Miami (18-15) had when it won eight of 11 from December 1st-16th. Since then, with a mix of home and road games, the Heat has gone 2-4. The Heat will attempt to get a win as they face off with one of the worst teams in the NBA when they travel to Sacramento on Friday night.
<br /><br />The trip started on a sour note as the Heat dropped a 108-87 decision in the Pepsi Center in Denver. Dwyane Wade did his best to try and get Miami off to a good road start, netting 31. Shawn Marion also contributed 25 points and 13 rebounds. The difference in the game came down to the free-throw line, which allowed Denver 40 trips against Miami's 16.
<br /><br />The game will mark an easier portion in Miami's schedule. Despite having to play the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston on their trip, the four other teams all have losing records.
<br /><br />First up are the Kings (8-28), who has lost four straight and have gone 1-10 in their last 11. Tuesday night they played an inspired game in Chicago, shooting 50.7 percent from the field, but losing 99-94 when Kevin Martin missed a potential tying shot with four second remaining.
<br /><br />Once again, just like Miami, Sacramento's downfall was at the free throw line. The Bulls hit on 33 of 34 attempts, while the Kings only went to the line 24 times, hitting on 19.
<br /><br />Despite missing the key shot, Martin had 29 points against Chicago and has averaged 30 points in his five games back after returning from three weeks out due to an injured ankle.
<br /><br />This will be the second meeting between the teams this year as Miami claimed the first contest 103-77 on Halloween night in Miami. The Heat have won nine of 10 against the Sacramento Kings, but lost their last visit into Arco Arena last season.

<br />Phoenix -4  vs. Detroit
<br /><br />Two teams that were on different planes a few weeks ago have been streaking in opposite directions. The Phoenix Suns have had trouble winning consistently lately, while the Charlotte Bobcats have been winning more frequently lately. It could possibly be the growing pains for one team has persisted, while the other has grown out of it as these two teams were involved in a six-player swap on December 11th and will meet up for the first time since then Friday night in Charlotte.
<br /><br />Jason Richardson and Jared Dudley were sent to Phoenix in exchange for forward Boris Diaw, guard Raja Bell and guard Sean Singletary. With no clear victor in the trade the result on the court will have to stand as proof and it appears Charlotte (17-25) got the better of the deal as they have won four of their last five.
<br /><br />In their last game, on Wednesday, the Bobcats improved to 10-9 since the trade with a 101-86 home victory over Memphis. Diaw and Bell have been paying off in spades for Charlotte. Diaw is averaging 13.6 points along with Bell’s 12.1 since the trade.
<br /><br />Charlotte looks to continue their momentum, win two straight and defeat Phoenix for the first time in its five year history on Friday. As it stands right now, Charlotte is only 2 ½ games out of the final Eastern Conference playoff spot.
<br /><br />The Suns (23-17) have bested the Bobcats in each of their eight previous games, but have little confidence left after losing four of their last five overall. Phoenix is 10-7 since the trade and is tied with Dallas for the final playoff spot in the West. Many of those 10 victories came early on after the trade. Now the Suns have been struggling as was evidenced in their 114-109 loss to New York on Wednesday.
<br /><br />Jason Richardson, who came over in the trade, did his best to earn his team a victory by posting 27 points against 20 points for Shaquille O’Neal. Richardson has averaged 15.7 points since joining the Suns.
<br /><br />This will be the first matchup of the teams this season. Last year, with a lot of the components of each team’s current squad on the other team, Charlotte lost both games by an average of 23 points.

<br />Dallas  +3 1/2 vs. Detroit
<br /><br />In his two seasons coaching the Detroit Pistons, Coach Rick Carlisle made his name with a stingy defense, with his current squad, the Dallas Mavericks—well not so much. Carlisle’s present team will travel to face his former team Friday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills.
<br /><br />Dallas’ defense reached a new low in their last contest, Wednesday night in Milwaukee. They allowed the Bucks to score the most points they have given up in seven years en route to a 133-99 rout. It was also the Mavericks’ (24-18) worst loss since November 2001.
<br /><br />Giving up 99 points per game, Dallas has seen that stat bloom to 109.6 in their last seven contests, of which they have lost five. Dirk Nowitzki is trying his best to keep his teams in these games. Over the past five games, he has averaged 31.4 points and has shot 52 percent.
<br /><br />The Pistons (24-17) are looking for their third straight victory after dropping five in a row from January 10th-January 17th. Wednesday, they defeated Toronto 95-76 in a solid defensive effort which saw Detroit hold the Raptors to 42.5 percent shooting. Tayshaun Prince led the way with 25 points on 11-of-16 from the field.
<br /><br />Detroit has been solid on defense much of the season, ranking fourth in the NBA in field goal defense and fourth fewest points allowed per game with 92.7. Their recent slide has more to do with their offense than their defense as they have struggled to reach 100 points. The Pistons have hit the century mark only once in the last 15 games.
<br /><br />This will be the first meeting of the year between the teams. They have alternated wins and losses in each of their last eight meetings at the Palace of Auburn Hills, with the Pistons taking the most recent game played there 90-67 last February 3rd.

<br /><br />Cleveland -6 1/2 vs. Golden
<br /><br />Alternating wins and losses over their last four, the Cleveland Cavaliers have not been their usual juggernaut selves, however they have a great shot at turning around this trend by winning two straight against the 30-loss Golden State Warriors when the teams met up Friday night at Oracle Arena.
<br /><br />Cleveland (32-8) was defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the opening game of their western road trip 105-88, but they bounced back to defeat Portland 104-98. The victory over the Trail Blazers prevented Cleveland from losing two straight games for the first time all season. The Cavaliers are in close step with Boston and Orlando for the race for the best record in the Eastern Conference.
<br /><br />After being beaten up by the Lakers, the Cavs’ defense returned against the Blazers. Cleveland held Portland to 40.7 percent shooting one game after allowing their season worst 52.4 percent to Los Angeles.
<br /><br />Cleveland is leading the league in scoring defense by only allowing 89.6 points per contest. A matchup with Golden State may seem easy on paper, but the Warriors are averaging a little over 107 points per game and that is without their high-octane scoring guard Monta Ellis, who will return to the lineup for the first time this season on Friday.
<br /><br />The Warriors (13-30) will welcome back Ellis, who has been out while recovering from a sprained ankle from a scooter accident during the off-season. The relationship between the player and the team was strained when Golden State suspended him for 30 games without pay for the incident after the Warriors had signed him to a six-year $66 million dollar contract just prior to the accident. He was rewarded handsomely for his career year a season ago when he averaged 20.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.4 assists.
<br /><br />This will be the second and final meeting of the year between the clubs. Cleveland held Golden State’s potent offense in check in their first meeting November 28th in Cleveland. The Cavaliers won 112-97 and held the Warriors to 39.8 percent shooting. The Cavs have won four of the last five matchups and the last two at Oracle Arena.

<br /><br />Chauncey Billups returned to the place where he put down roots and turned a once proud, but struggling franchise back into a one of the NBA's elite. He was greeted with one of the warmest welcomes of an opposing member that anyone can remember, but when the ball was tipped off an alarmingly regular occurrence took place: Billups scored a bunch of points but his team still lost. Because of their recent consistent losing, Portland has caught up to Denver in the Southeast standings and is one-game behind the Denver Nuggets. The teams will battle for first place Thursday night at the Pepsi Center.
<br /><br />Billups scored 34 points on his return to the Palace of Auburn Hills Tuesday. He had been the face of the franchise for more than six seasons, leading Detroit to six straight Eastern Conference finals, two NBA finals and a championship in 2004, when he was named finals MVP before being shipped to Denver in a package deal for Allen Iverson. Billups scored 30 points when his former mates came to Denver in early January, but both times the result was a loss. Tuesday the Pistons won their third straight overall, all over division leaders, as they try to rejuvenate their season, 100-95.
<br /><br />This disturbing trend does not just happen in games with Detroit. Over the past seven games, the Denver Nuggets have gone 2-5. During that time Billups has averaged 23.6 points per contest. His average balloons to 27.0 if not for his poorest points output of the season when he scored 3 in a 114-76 shellacking at the hands of Boston. Billups has scored 20 points or more in eight of his last 10 games.
<br /><br />Portland (37-22) has made the most of their division rivals struggling. While Denver has lost five of their last seven, the Porland Trail Blazers have done the complete opposite and won five of their last seven. They are also 7-3 over their last 10 contest.
<br /><br />They come into this game after playing Wednesday night at home against Indiana. Prior to that contest, they won their second straight by besting the second best team in the West at the Rose Garden, 102-84 over San Antonio. Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge combined to score just over half of all of the Blazer points as each scored 26. Steve Blake added 15 and Channing Frye scored a dozen coming off the bench.
<br /><br />This will be the third meeting of the season between the division rivals after they played a home-and-home in late December. Both teams won their home game, Denver 97-89 on December 22nd and Portland 101-92 the next night.

<br /><br />Michigan State rapped up the Big Ten title with a victory Tuesday night over Indiana, but Illinois and Penn State still have a lot to play for. The conference rivals will tip off in Happy Valley on Thursday night in Senior Night for the Nittany Lions.
<br /><br />Any hopes 23rd-ranked Illinois (23-7, 11-6) had at grabbing the Big Ten dissipated in their last game, a 77-64 loss to the Spartans on Senior Day at Assembly Hall. Eight-ranked Michigan State won a share of the title and eliminated the Illinois Fighting Illini from grabbing at least a share of it with the win. They then clinched the outright title, for the first time since 1999, two days later in Indiana.
<br /><br />Michigan State got out to a good start, leading by 11 but the Illini tied it at 58 all with 7:19 remaining. But then Illinois went cold, missing on all of its shots until 33 seconds were left. Four of the five Illini starters were in double-figures with Mike Tisdale leading the way with 15.
<br /><br />Illinois will end their season against Penn State and will seek a victory over the Nittany Lions and hope that Michigan State will not rest their key players in their Sunday matchup with second place Purdue. If the Boilermakers lose one of their final two games and Illinois wins their season finale, the Fighting Illini would move into second place. The difference in the positioning would be for the rights to play the worst team in the conference, the Hoosiers, in the opening round of the Big Ten tournament. Michigan State, as regular season champions, will receive a bye.
<br /><br />While the Illini know they will make it despite what they do in their season finale and conference tournament, Penn State (20-9, 9-7) is still considered a bubble team despite winning 20 games. The Lions still have another game, Saturday at Iowa to improve their standing. But a win over 10th place Iowa will mean nothing, especially with a loss to Illinois.
<br /><br />The Penn State Nittany Lions resume building victories were Minnesota, at Michigan State and Purdue. One thing working against Penn State is that the selection committee looks at big non-conference wins more than victories against conference foes who a team sees once or twice per regular season. The Lions do not have a marquee non-conference victory.
<br /><br />Still all Penn State can do is go out and win their last two games and a victory over the Illini on Senior Night may just push the Lions into the proverbial bubble.
<br /><br />The signature Big Ten defense was on full display in the teams last meeting at Assembly Hall on February 18th, a 38-33 Penn State win. The Lions have won three of the last four games in the series.
