I suppose I'd better see a Doctor!&quot; &quot;Listen, don't waste your time down at the surgery,&quot; Mike replies. &quot;There's a new diagnostic computer at Tesco Pharmacy.
<br />Just give it a urine sample and the computer will tell you what's wrong, and what to do about it. It takes ten seconds and only costs five quid.....a lot Quicker and better than a doctor and you get Club card points&quot;. So Jack collects a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to Tesco. He deposits five pounds and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample. He pours the sample into the slot and waits. Ten seconds later, the computer ejects a printout: &quot;You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity. It will improve in two weeks&quot;.
<br />That evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Jack Began wondering if the computer could be fooled. He mixed some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, urine samples from his wife and daughter and the cat, and masturbated into the mixture for good measure. Jack hurried back to Tesco, eager to check what would happen. He deposits five pounds, pours in his concoction, and awaits the results. The computer printed the following:
<br />1) Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener.
<br />2) Your cat's having kittens. Get a vet
<br />3) Your dog has ringworm. Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.
<br />4) Your daughter has a cocaine habit. Get her into rehab.
<br />5) Your wife is pregnant. Twins. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer.
<br />6) And if you don't stop playing with yourself, your elbow will never get better........
<br /><br />Thank you for shopping at Tesco.

<br />If you're ugly,
<br />stop acting like you don't know it.
<br />The captions under you picture that says
<br />&quot;top model pose&quot;
<br />&quot;sexy bitch&quot;
<br />&quot;arnt i hot&quot;
<br />doesn't convince anyone.
<br /><br />TWO
<br />To the people who have like 25,000 friends,
<br />are you serious?
<br />Nobody in this universe can keep up with that many friends.
<br />You're stupid.
<br />Go play in traffic.
<br /><br />THREE
<br />Don't ever post pictures and say
<br />&quot;OMG, I'm so ugly&quot;
<br />&quot;OMG,I'm so fat&quot;
<br />because if you were,
<br />you wouldn't post them.
<br /><br />FOUR
<br />Nobody cares about threats over the internet.
<br />Don't try to act hardcore with the keyboard.
<br />Fighting online is like racing in the special olympics;
<br />even if you win,
<br />you're still retarded.
<br /><br />FIVE
<br />Making 20 bulletins a day
<br />about how you have new pictures
<br />and begging people to comment on them is pathetic.
<br />Make the bulletin once if you have to,
<br />and those who actually care about you
<br />will comment on your pics.
<br /><br />SIX
<br />If all your pictures look the same,
<br />don't post them all.
<br />Please put some variety in your pics.
<br />Nobody wants to see your face
<br />8 different ways.
<br /><br />SEVEN
<br />Who really cares if
<br />I don't accept you as a friend?
<br />MOVE ON!!!
<br />Don't send me another request or message asking
<br />&quot;what's up with you not adding me?&quot;
<br />I don't want you as a friend;
<br />that's what's up!
<br /><br />EIGHT
<br />Little year 7's who have bebos
<br />and look like sluts,
<br />go somewhere else
<br />because nobody wants you here.!!!
<br /><br />NINE
<br />If you have decided to read this,
<br />you are a true bebo Friend.
<br />Real friends read their bulletins.
<br /><br />TEN
<br />I say you go and pass this on
<br />and maybe it will finally get through people's brains
<br />(if they have them).
<br /><br />ELEVEN
<br />And if you open a msg and it says something like
<br />&quot;repost this in 100 seconds or a ghost will rape your dog tonight,&quot;
<br />IT'S NOT REAL!
<br />QUIT BEING AN IDIOT!!!!!!!!
<br />PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO LIFE WHATSOEVER MAKE THAT SHIT UP THINKING THAT PEOPLE WILL FALL FOR THEIR STUPID TRAP!!! AND YOU DO!!!!

<br /><br />Read this question, come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result. This is not a trick question. It is as it reads. 
<br /><br />A woman, while at the funeral for her own mother, met this guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing! She fell in love with him right there, but never asked for his number and could not find him later. A few days later she killed her sister. 
<br /><br />Question: What is her motive in killing her 
<br />sister? (Give this some thought before you answer). SCROLL DOWN. 
<br /><br />Answer: She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again. 
<br />If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test by a famous American Psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly. If you didn't answer the question correctly good for you. If you got the answer correct, please 
<br />let me know so I can take you off of my email list unless that will tick you off, then I'll just be extra nice to you from now on. Be sure to share the test.
<br /><br />repost as &lt;psycho test&gt;

<br /><br />My two separate worlds had collided, but somehow I was more torn between them than ever before. I hope I never feel alone again like I did in that moment. I would sit in the corner of my room and wish with all my being that the floor would open up beneath me and take me away from the decision I was going to have to face.
<br />      I was a coward, afraid of my own lies. Whichever way I chose a part of me would be left behind and someone would get hurt. Never before had I felt so much shame at my own humanity.

<br /><br />Girl: Baby, what are u talking about?? I don't want you to leave me, I love you.
<br /><br />Boy: Not like that, I mean I'm moving far away.
<br /><br />Girl: Why? All of your famliy lives over here.
<br /><br />Boy: Well, my father is sending me away to a boarding school far away.
<br /><br />Girl: I can't believe this.
<br /><br />[FATHER: (Picks up the other phone, interrupts &amp; yells furiously ERICA!, what did I tell you about talking to boys?!!!... Get off the damn phone!! (And hangs up).]
<br /><br />Boy: Wow, your father sounds really mad.
<br /><br />Girl: You know how he gets, but anyways, I dont want you to go.
<br /><br />Boy: Would you run away with me?
<br /><br />Girl: Baby, you know I would, I would do anything for you, but I can't... You don't know what would happen if I did. My dad would kill me!
<br /><br />Boy: *Sad* It's okay.. I understand, I guess..
<br /><br />Girl: *Thinking*I can't believe what's going on.
<br /><br />Boy: I need to give you something tonite, because I am leaving on flight 1-80 in the morning, so I need to see you now.
<br /><br />Girl: Okay, I will sneak out &amp; meet you at the park.
<br /><br />Boy: Okay, I'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
<br /><br />[They meet at a nearby park, they both hug eachother. And he gives her a note.]
<br /><br />Boy: Here you go, this is for you. I gotta go.
<br /><br />Girl: *Tear* (Begins to cry.)
<br /><br />Boy: Baby, dont cry, you know I love you... But I have to go.
<br /><br />Girl: Okay (Begins to walk away.)
<br /><br />[They both go back home. And Erica begins to read the letter he gave her]
<br /><br />It says...
<br /><br />&quot;Erica,
<br />You probably already know that I'm leaving, I knew this would be better if I wrote a letter explaining the truth about how much I care about you. The truth is, is that I never loved you, I hated you so much, you are my bitch and dont you ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, and be around you. You really have no clue how much I hate you. Now that I'm leaving I
<br />thought you should know that I hate you, bitch. You never did the right thing, and you were never there. I didnt think I could hate someone as much as I hate you. And I never want to see you, for the rest of my life, I will never miss kissing you like before, I never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will not miss you and that's a promise. You never had my love, and I want you to remember that. Bitch, you keep this letter because this may be the last thing you have from me. Fuck, I hate you so much. I will not talk to you soon bitch... Goodbye.
<br />- Ricardo&quot;
<br /><br />[ Erica begins to cry, she throws the paper in tha garbage &amp; crys for hours ]
<br /><br />... A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels so lonely... Then she gets a phone call....
<br /><br />Friend: How are you feeling?
<br /><br />Girl: I just cant believe this happened.. I thought he loved me.
<br /><br />Friend: Oh, about that. Ricardo left me a message. A few days ago.
<br />He told me to tell you to look in your jacket pocket or something...
<br /><br />Girl: Umm.. okay.
<br /><br />[She finds a piece of paper in the jacket,]
<br /><br />It says:
<br /><br />&quot;Baby I hope you find this before you read my letter. I knew your dad might read it, so I switched a few words...
<br /><br />Hate = Love
<br /><br />Never = Always
<br /><br />Bitch = Baby
<br /><br />Will not= will
<br /><br />.... I hope you didn't take that seriously because I love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go thats why I wanted you to run away with me...
<br />-Ricardo&quot;
<br /><br />Girl: Oh my God! It's a letter.. Ricardo does love me!!, he must of slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. I can't believe how stupid I am!!
<br /><br />Friend: lol Okay but I g2g... Call me later.
<br /><br />Girl: *happy*okay, bye, I'll be at home waiting for my baby to call me!
<br /><br />... Erica turns the T.V. on......
<br /><br />[Breaking news] &quot;An airplane has crashed. Over 47 young boys died, we are still searching for survivors... This is a tragedy we will never forget, this plane was flight 1-80... it was on its way to an all boys boarding school...&quot; the Reporter says.
<br /><br />She turns off the t.v. ... 3 days later, she kills herself, because of the fact that Ricardo was dead &amp; she had nothing to live for...
<br /><br />... A day after that the phone rings. Nobody answers. It was Ricardo, he called to leave a message. &quot;Its Ricardo, I guess you're not home so, I called to let you know that I'm alive, I missed my flight because I had to see you one last time. So, I hope your not worried. I am staying for good, I love you baby.&quot;
<br /><br />But she was already gone

<br /><br />A girl came skipping home FROM school one day. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; she yelled, &quot;we were counting today, and all the other kids could only count to four, but I counted to 10. See? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her mother. 
<br /><br />&quot;Is it because I'm blonde, Mommy?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Yes, Honey, it's because you're blonde.&quot; 
<br /><br />The next day the girl came skipping home FROM school. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; She yelled, &quot;we were saying the alphabet today, and all the other kids could only say it to D, but I said it to G. See? A,b, c, d, e, f, g!&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her mother. 
<br /><br />&quot;Is it because I'm blonde, Mommy?&quot;

<br /><br />The next day the girl came skipping home FROM school. &quot;Mommy, Mommy,&quot; she yelled, &quot;we were in gym class today, and when we showered, all the other girls had flat chests, but I have these!&quot; And she lifted her tank top to reveal a pair of 36Cs. 
<br /><br />&quot;Very good,&quot; said her embarrassed mother. 
<br /><br />&quot;Is it because I'm blonde, mommy?&quot; 
<br /><br />&quot;No, Honey, it's because you're 25.&quot;
