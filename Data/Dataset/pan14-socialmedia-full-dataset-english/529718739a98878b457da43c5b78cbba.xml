<br />It hurts and it doesn't help at all
<br />I still want you in my life as crazy as that seems
<br />I want you to catch me when I fall
<br /><br />I still remember the first time we met
<br />There was something so different about you
<br />Your friendship was something I wanted to get
<br />That smile when you said hi to me was so new
<br /><br />Out of no where you called me on the phone
<br />I wanted to sit there and talk to you forever
<br />You were so new, so crazy and unknown
<br />I just knew that our friendship would never sever
<br /><br />Two years and we are barely holding it together
<br />What happened to the way this all used to be
<br />I never wanted you out of my like ever
<br />I sat there for a long time pretending not to see
<br /><br />We decided to go out and make it all all right
<br />It didn't work out of course we knew it couldn't
<br />We couldn't even really stand each others sight
<br />It shouldn't end this way but it did and I shouldn't
<br /><br />I miss you and everything you were to me
<br />Ten years from now we will look back on it all
<br />We will be older and finally be able to see
<br />That love will stand the test of time and never fall

<br />Being her friend was like haveing a bright, new pearl
<br />She was the best, she was so much fun
<br />But then one day she decided that she was done
<br />She would not talk, She would not play
<br />So I was left alone, left alone all day
<br />To tell her how i felt.. Well i didn't have the guts
<br />Yet everyday the pain got worse like big paper cuts
<br />This girl would get mad even when i would try to call
<br />I had a friend, A really nice friend, a friend that was no friend at all

<br />But it only took about a week for that to end,
<br />I thought there was hope left in my life,
<br />But as it turns out, it was only added strife,
<br />I thought for once I had done something right,
<br />But I quickly corrected that oversight,
<br />I thought I wasn’t useless or a bore,
<br />But I was all that and even more,
<br />I thought there was a purpose to my days,
<br />But that was only a very short phase,
<br />I thought you weren’t like all the rest,
<br />But like those before, you failed the test,
<br />I thought you would stay with me, at least for a bit,
<br />But you decided it was better just to quit,
<br />I thought life was worth living for a moment in time,
<br />But the life I wanted could never be mine,
<br />I thought the hunger inside had been fed,
<br />But now I know, I was just being misled.
<br />And now I think I’ve found another perfect friend,
<br />How long before my heart is broken again?

<br />With love so sudden and so sweet.
<br />Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower 
<br />And stole my heart away complete. 
<br /><br />My face turned pale, a deadly pale.
<br />My legs refused to walk away,
<br />And when she looked what could I ail
<br />My life and all seemed turned to clay. 
<br /><br />And then my blood rushed to my face 
<br />And took my eyesight quite away.
<br />The trees and bushes round the place 
<br />Seemed midnight at noonday. 
<br /><br />I could not see a single thing,
<br />Words from my eyes did start.
<br />They spoke as chords do from the string,
<br />And blood burnt round my heart. 
<br /><br />Are flowers the winter's choice
<br />Is love's bed always snow
<br />She seemed to hear my silent voice 
<br />Not love appeals to know. 
<br /><br />I never saw so sweet a face
<br />As that I stood before.
<br />My heart has left its dwelling place
<br />And can return no more.

<br />to feel your chest rise and fall

<br />I am successful because GOD giifted me loving friends...
<br /><br />Friendship is a priceless gift,
<br />That cannot be bought or sold.
<br />But its value is far great than,
<br />A mountain made of gold.
<br /><br />For gold is cold and lifeless,
<br />It cannot see nor hear.
<br />And in times of trouble,
<br />It's powerless to cheer.
<br /><br />It has no ears to listen,
<br />Nor a heart to understand.
<br />It cannot give you comfort,
<br />Or lend a helping hand.
<br /><br />So when you ask God for a gift
<br />Be happy if he sends
<br />Not diamonds pearls or riches
<br />But the love of a true GREAT FRIEND!!

		<document id="223eefaef225b678162f11fa29bdb897" url=""><![CDATA[Please Hear What I'm Not Saying<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by me. 
<br />Don't be fooled by the face I wear for I wear a mask, 
<br />a thousand masks, 
<br />masks that I'm afraid to take off, 
<br />and none of them is me. 
<br /><br />Pretending is an art that's second nature with me, 
<br />but don't be fooled, for God's sake don't be fooled. 
<br />I give you the impression that I'm secure, 
<br />that all is sunny and unruffled with me, 
<br />within as well as without, 
<br />that confidence is my name and coolness my game, 
<br />that the water's calm and I'm in command and that I need no one, 
<br />but don't believe me. 
<br />My surface may seem smooth but my surface is my mask, 
<br />ever-varying and ever-concealing. 
<br />Beneath lies no complacence. 
<br />Beneath lies confusion, and fear, and aloneness. 
<br />But I hide this. 
<br />I don't want anybody to know it. 
<br />I panic at the thought of my weakness exposed. 
<br />That's why I frantically create a mask to hide behind, 
<br />a nonchalant sophisticated facade, 
<br />to help me pretend, 
<br />to shield me from the glance that knows. 
<br /><br />But such a glance is precisely my salvation, 
<br />my only hope, and I know it. 
<br />That is, if it's followed by acceptance, 
<br />if it's followed by love. 
<br />It's the only thing that can liberate me from myself, 
<br />from my own self-built prison walls, 
<br />from the barriers I so painstakingly erect. 
<br />It's the only thing that will assure me of what I can't assure myself, 
<br />that I'm really worth something. 
<br />But I don't tell you this. 
<br />I don't dare to, I'm afraid to. 
<br />I'm afraid your glance will not be followed by acceptance, 
<br />will not be followed by love. 
<br />I'm afraid you'll think less of me, 
<br />that you'll laugh, and your laugh would kill me. 
<br />I'm afraid that deep-down I'm nothing 
<br />and that you will see this and reject me. 
<br /><br />So I play my game, my desperate pretending game, 
<br />with a facade of assurance without and a trembling child within. 
<br />So begins the glittering but empty parade of masks, 
<br />and my life becomes a front. 
<br />I tell you everything that's really nothing, 
<br />and nothing of what's everything, 
<br />of what's crying within me. 
<br />So when I'm going through my routine 
<br />do not be fooled by what I'm saying. 
<br />Please listen carefully and try to hear what I'm not saying, 
<br />what I'd like to be able to say, 
<br />what for survival I need to say, 
<br />but what I can't say. 
<br /><br />I don't like hiding. 
<br />I don't like playing superficial phony games. 
<br />I want to stop playing them. 
<br />I want to be genuine and spontaneous and me 
<br />but you've got to help me. 
<br />You've got to hold out your hand 
<br />even when that's the last thing I seem to want. 
<br />Only you can wipe away from my eyes 
<br />the blank stare of the breathing dead. 
<br />Only you can call me into aliveness. 
<br />Each time you're kind, and gentle, and encouraging, 
<br />each time you try to understand because you really care, 
<br />my heart begins to grow wings-- 
<br />very small wings, 
<br />very feeble wings, 
<br />but wings! 
<br /><br />With your power to touch me into feeling 
<br />you can breathe life into me. 
<br />I want you to know that. 
<br />I want you to know how important you are to me, 
<br />how you can be a creator--an honest-to-God creator-- 
<br />of the person that is me if you choose to. 
<br />You alone can break down the wall behind which I tremble, 
<br />you alone can remove my mask, 
<br />you alone can release me from my shadow-world of panic, 
<br />from my lonely prison, 
<br />if you choose to. 
<br />Please choose to. 
<br /><br />Do not pass me by. 
<br />It will not be easy for you. 
<br />A long conviction of worthlessness builds strong walls. 
<br />The nearer you approach to me the blinder I may strike back. 
<br />It's irrational, but despite what the books say about man 
<br />often I am irrational. 
<br />I fight against the very thing I cry out for. 
<br />But I am told that love is stronger than strong walls 
<br />and in this lies my hope. 
<br />Please try to beat down those walls 
<br />with firm hands but with gentle hands 
<br />for a child is very sensitive. 
<br /><br />Who am I, you may wonder? 
<br />I am someone you know very well. 
<br />For I am every man you meet 
<br />and I am every woman you meet.

<br />I seem to love you
<br />But other times I seem to loathe you
<br /><br />I can't be without you
<br />Or maybe just without anyone
<br />I think about you all the time
<br />But why do I have this feeling?
<br /><br />I long for your voice
<br />And I would die to hear your laugh
<br />But is this love
<br />Or merely lust?

<br />Only to see the sun fall
<br /><br />My eyes will not see what they longed to see
<br />My lips will not taste what they longed to taste
<br /><br />Why does life have to be like this
<br />Full of hatred and pain
<br />Instead of joy and bliss

<br />But it became a disease when she stop loving me
<br />Buried alive by self-hatered of someone else that accompany her
<br />It all became a reality when my blue skies where torn down with green jealousy
<br />Bleeding red envy from a dying relative's corpse
<br />This development in life has ended in sorrow
<br />Creating a hole inside thats hollow
<br />The dark cloud shadows above my crown
<br />Leaving a feeling of grey and depression.
<br /><br />This moment of despair has ended in conjunction,
<br />Now I can't function with her departure,
<br />Maybe its her culture as a heartless lover
<br />To disappear never to reappear;
<br />But only in a dream, where she screamed
<br />And I died before I told her that I love her.
<br />The stars dim as I fade and her world becomes dark again-
<br />The ballad of a dead lover begins to play the sorrow he wanted to say:
<br />My love, my love, I give you this sweet smell of rose
<br />That savors your biology, even the Gods can smell you up above.
<br />Despite our imperfections our love is true as the sky is blue-
<br />unexpectivly our vocabulary died,
<br />And you became a heartless lover
<br />And I died a hopeful lover.
