You could squeeze, swipe, stretch data and images in innovative ways and in no time at all there were legions of fans of the iPhone. Touchscreen cell phones were not all that new; however, earlier touchscreen phones were resistive, that is, they depended upon pressure to understand the placement of touch commands. But, iPhones use capacitive touchscreen which transfers electric current from your skin to the phone screen. There is no dependence on pressure, light, heat or anything of that sort. The delicate electric currents of your skin transmit to the touchscreen enabling it to understand the location of the commands. If there is no connection between your fingers and the touchscreen, the iPhone is unable to respond.

With its capacitive touchscreen, this phone allowed users to play around with the data in hitherto unimagined ways. You could squeeze, swipe, stretch data and images in innovative ways and in no time at all there were legions of fans of the iPhone. Touchscreen cell phones were not all that new; however, earlier touchscreen phones were resistive, that is, they depended upon pressure to understand the placement of touch commands. But, iPhones use capacitive touchscreen which transfers electric current from your skin to the phone screen. There is no dependence on pressure, light, heat or anything of that sort. The delicate electric currents of your skin transmit to the touchscreen enabling it to understand the location of the commands. If there is no connection between your fingers and the touchscreen, the iPhone is unable to respond.

With the normal gloves the connection gets broken and you are unable to use your iPhone. But, why iPhone gloves, you may wonder? The reason is very simple and once you know it you will think, ‘of course, that is true!’ For those who live in less hospitable climes where winters can get severe or for that matter, even places with normal winter, it is frustrating when you have to keep whipping off your gloves to use your iPhone. You may miss an important call by the time that glove is off or you may have your fingers frozen in the biting cold when you are on the phone.  
<br /><br />Cellphone gloves are a great invention for this very purpose as they are uniquely designed to transmit electric currents from your hand to any surface of the glove. This enables you to use your <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9JUGhvbmU_" target="_blank">iPhone</a> with ease besides keeping your hands warm. They are snug-fitting and warm and help the iPhone user to make or receive calls or text or use the touchscreen in any manner easily.

In fact, they make for excellent holiday gifts for the technology geek as they are affordable, stylish and very, very useful.
