<br />You made everything all right.
<br />You picked me up when I was down;
<br />You turned my life around.
<br />If I didn't have you, what would I be?
<br />A blessing is what you are to me.
<br /><br />When I needed you the most, you were there;
<br />Even if it seemed like you didn't care.
<br />When I didn't think I could make it another day,
<br />You chased all my doubts away.
<br />A treasure is what you are to me.
<br /><br />The world is full of many people, it's true;
<br />But there is only one of you.
<br />You fill my heart with love;
<br />You're a God-sent gift from above.
<br />And an angel is what you are to me.
<br /><br />Lost and alone, I will no longer be;
<br />Because you are here with me.
<br />There is no reason to be sad;
<br />You've taken away all the bad.
<br />If I didn't have you, what would I be?
<br />A best friend is what you are to me!!

<br />No matter where I go, I always screw things up.
<br />Never will I succeed.
<br />I am alone.
<br />I am a burden.
<br />Nothing I do is ever good enough.
<br />I am a mistake.
<br />I guess I should never have been brought into this world.
<br />I am a joke.
<br />Nobody ever takes me seriously.
<br />I am a broken heart.
<br />What’s the use of something that it shattered into a million tiny pieces? 
<br />I am forgotten.
<br />It’s not that people leave me out, they just don’t remember me.
<br />I am a son.
<br />Not that it really makes a difference, I’m no good anyways.
<br />I am an embarrassment.
<br />Always bringing shame upon those near me.
<br />I am a nightmare.
<br />A situation people would love to wake up from.
<br />I am a disappointment.
<br />No one will ever approve of me.
<br />I am misunderstood.
<br />How can someone understand you, when you don’t even understand yourself? 
<br />I am a scar.
<br />A reminder of a bad past, that never goes away.
<br />I am an apology.
<br />Even when I’ve done no wrong, I am the sorry one.
<br />I am a scream.
<br />A cry for help that will forever go unheard.
<br />I am a tear.
<br />A tear that keeps falling but goes unnoticed.
<br />I am a disgrace.
<br />An example of complete humiliation.
<br />I am used.
<br />They get what they want, and then throw me away.
<br />I am a fallen spirit.
<br />Never to rise back up.
<br />I am a cutter.
<br />Same old story, same miserable teen.
<br />I am lost.
<br />So vanished I’m at the point of no return.
<br />I am scared.
<br />Frightened of what’s to happen with me next.
<br />I am misplaced.
<br />It’s not like I will ever fit in with these people.
<br />I am a tragedy.
<br />A cycle of misfortunes. 
<br />I am denied.
<br />Why would they claim a disaster like me? 
<br />I am guilt.
<br />Set aside deep into your conscience, always with you but wanted gone.
<br />I am a smile.
<br />So perfectly created, yet not even real.
<br />I am a regret.
<br />A haunting memory of what should have never happened.
<br />I am broken.
<br />Almost impossible to put back together.
<br />I am a masterpiece.
<br />Flawlessly constructed on the outside, with a past of hidden pain on the inside.
<br />I am helpless.
<br />Nothing can save me now.
<br />I am me…
<br />I am that guy that can never do anything right with her life.
<br />I am that kid that everyone loves to hate.
<br />I am that kid that cries herself to sleep at night, wishing she were someone else.
<br />I am that guy lying on the ground, the bathroom floor as her comfort zone.
<br />I am invisible.
<br />People say they can see right through me, but really they can’t see me at all.
<br />I am everything that could ever go wrong.
<br />I am everything that you are glad you aren’t.
<br />I am everything that you don’t want me to be.
<br />Love me, despise me.
<br />Accept me, refuse me.
<br />Stay with me, abandon me.
<br />I can't be anything except for the person I've become.
<br />I can’t change and I won’t change.
<br />Perfection will never be apart of me.
<br />In fact, its all my imperfections that make up the person you see standing before you.
<br />Changing isn’t an option, 
<br />But I have no choice except to be what I've always been.

<br />You don't know when I cry or when I'm afraid.
<br />You can't see the real Me, because I try to hide my face.
<br />I hide in the corner where it’s all black and gray, where everyone's afraid to go
<br />and would rather just stay away.
<br />They think I'm just a girl who wants nothing to do with anyone.
<br />But really do they know what's going on?
<br />I hide in my corner and in the rain
<br />and cry my eyes out so no one sees my pain.
<br />People act like they care, but they really don’t.
<br />They make up jokes and think I don't know.
<br />The pain really hurts only if they knew.
<br />But they don't because
<br />I just refuse.
<br />I can't help but have all this pain.
<br />Which will make me remain the same.
<br />Huddled up in my little black and gray
<br />corner, all alone again.
<br />But I guess that's just where I'll stay.

<br />Because it's deep inside of me
<br />It blocks my heart on every side
<br />And lets my emotions hide
<br />You can’t reach in
<br />You can’t reach out
<br />And you wonder what its all about.
<br /><br />This wall I have that you can’t see
<br />Results from what was done to me
<br />Each time my heart was hurt
<br />The scars within grew worse and worse
<br />So brick by brick I built this wall
<br />I made it so thick it will not fall.
<br /><br />I know this process will be slow
<br />For its never easy to let things go
<br />For just by brick by brick I laid
<br />With every hurt and every pain
<br />It's really hard to let people in
<br />Thinking I might get hurt again.
<br /><br />Maybe brick by brick this wall will break
<br />As love replaces every ache (who knows when)
<br />This wall will fall to set me free
<br />But some of the debris will still stay
<br />Deep inside of me!!!

<br />Love is nothing... 
<br />It is just a four letter word
<br />Just like bird, turd, curb, and nerd
<br />It has no meaning
<br />That is to me
<br />Wait, yes it does 
<br />Let's see
<br />Love is a feeling
<br />Nice for a moment
<br />But causes unbearable pain that hurt
<br />Yea, that is to one who opens their eyes
<br />And realize what is in front of you
<br />Love really hurts...
<br />It leaves your heart broke
<br />And makes you want to choke
<br />It is not nice 
<br />It is nothing but a joke
<br />A joke that makes you mad
<br />Raging with anger
<br />You want to hit that person up side the head 
<br />With a metal hanger
<br />Love is like a stranger 
<br />That comes in and out of your life
<br />But you should still give love a try
<br />You should open up your eyes
<br />So you can see how love can really be
<br />It can be frightening
<br />It may leave you in misery
<br />Some say love is beautiful
<br />and that love is sweet
<br />Love can stink
<br />Just like dirty feet
<br />Love is something special
<br />It is like a mystery
<br />Wouldn't you agree
<br />I thought I knew
<br />But I always wake up with no clue
<br />So what is Love
<br />Will you be kind enough to tell me....

<br />To the secret of my destiny
<br />And every new road I think is the one
<br />Seems to lead right back to me.
<br /><br />I’ve looked for a way to be wiser
<br />A way to be strong
<br />Now I see the answer was hiding
<br />In me all along.
<br /><br />Restless, hopeless and misunderstood
<br />Like so many others I know
<br />So busy trying to keep holding on
<br />When I should’ve been letting go.
<br /><br />I was given the gift to find it
<br />The spirit all inside me
<br />But I never really imagined
<br />All I could be.
<br /><br />The answer to all my wonder
<br />Was right in my hands
<br />Now its’s time for me to discover
<br />All that I am.

<br />I can only be me, 
<br />Not the friend you expect me to be. 
<br /><br />I'd give anything to make you happy 
<br />Even if it makes me sad, 
<br />I'd never do anything to hurt you 
<br />I don't try to make you mad. 
<br /><br />Most of the times you get angry 
<br />And we begin to fight, 
<br />Little do you know 
<br />I cry myself to sleep at night. 
<br /><br />Sometimes I don't know 
<br />Just what I did wrong, 
<br />I don't understand 
<br />Why we don't get along. 
<br /><br />Every time we fight 
<br />I wish you could feel my heart break, 
<br />Sometimes I wonder 
<br />How much more my heart can take. 
<br /><br />Sometimes I get so angry 
<br />I don't know what to say, 
<br />I feel just like a game 
<br />That everyone wants to play. 
<br /><br />The only thing I need in this world 
<br />Is someone who is true, 
<br />The only thing I want in this world... 
<br />Is a friend like you.

		<document id="ead7805dab697d415342ea51dbcafb1e" url=""><![CDATA[Words<br/><br/>I tried writing this same poem
<br />At least ten times before
<br />Not knowing how to start
<br />Or how to express more.
<br /><br />It was supposed to be about my best friend
<br />But there is no words to compare
<br />For he is one of a kind
<br />Which should be only fair.
<br /><br />Although it's quite a statement
<br />Well, it happens to be true
<br />The best friend I have ever had
<br />I am glad to say, is you.
<br /><br />You're there if I should need you
<br />And you never turn away
<br />I know I can depend on you
<br />At any time of day.
<br /><br />We've had our ups and downs
<br />As nearly everybody does
<br />But problems never last for long
<br />With special close friends like us.
<br /><br />Some people have so many friends
<br />With whom they spend their time
<br />But no-one has a best friend
<br />Who is as wonderful as mine.
<br /><br />So thank you for always being there
<br />Your friendship is so strong and true
<br />And I just want to let you know
<br />I am glad and so lucky I found you!

<br />she was once there,
<br />smiling, beaming...
<br />staring at me...
<br />warmly, sweetly...
<br /><br />I met his eyes...
<br />dreaming, sighing...
<br />For she touched my heart
<br />softly, intensely....
<br /><br />But now...
<br />she left me - 
<br />and left was space 
<br />filled with cobwebs of misty reverie
<br />Now she merely is
<br />a fantasy - a once sweet memory...
<br /><br />Looking ahead and moving on...
<br />time to wake up and face reality
<br />meet life
<br />and no time to be sorry.
<br /><br />Gone...
<br />to follow
<br />the distant part of bitter fancy
<br />and i will find the path
<br />leading to reminiscence-heavenly...
<br /><br />Yet i will never forget
<br />she will fervently be -
<br />the rose who stirred up my spirit,
<br />and the thorn who pierced me deeply!

<br />You are a mystery everyone wants to unravel
<br />You are a question which does not seem to have an answer
<br />You are something concealed in a veil of secrecy.
<br />It is possible that someday men can count
<br />the grains of sand by the sea
<br />and they may know all the secrets of the galaxy
<br />But to think that one day
<br />they can explain the meaning of life fully
<br />this sound so impossible to me.
<br />You bring luck and success which makes us happy
<br />Yet the pains and problems you yield are unbearable
<br />You make us smile or frown, dull or lively
<br />All of these are truly unexplainable.
<br />But puzzling and enigmatic as you are
<br />You are the most wonderful thing that happened
<br />Or shall I say the most beautiful thing that exist
<br />Life, please never cease, and let your mystery be for eternity!
