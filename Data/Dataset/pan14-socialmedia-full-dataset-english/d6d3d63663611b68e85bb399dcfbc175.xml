<br />with more health than illness,
<br />you are more blessed than the
<br />million who won't survive the week.
<br /><br />If you have never experienced
<br />the danger of battle,
<br />the loneliness of imprisonment,
<br />the agony of torture or
<br />the pangs of starvation,
<br />you are ahead of 20 million people
<br />around the world.
<br /><br />If you attend a church meeting
<br />without fear of harassment,
<br />arrest, torture, or death,
<br />you are more blessed than almost
<br />three billion people in the world.
<br /><br />If you have food in your refrigerator,
<br />clothes on your back, a roof over
<br />your head and a place to sleep,
<br />you are richer than 75% of this world.
<br /><br />If you have money in the bank,
<br />in your wallet, and spare change
<br />in a dish someplace, you are among
<br />the top 8% of the world's wealthy.
<br /><br />If your parents are still married and alive,
<br />you are very rare,
<br />especially in the United States.
<br /><br />If you hold up your head with a smile
<br />on your face and are truly thankful,
<br />you are blessed because the majority can,
<br />but most do not.
<br /><br />If you can hold someone's hand, hug them
<br />or even touch them on the shoulder,
<br />you are blessed because you can
<br />offer God's healing touch.
<br /><br />If you can read this message,
<br />you are more blessed than over
<br />two billion people in the world
<br />that cannot read anything at all.
<br /><br />You are so blessed in ways
<br />you may never even know.
<br /><br />If you are feeling blessed, repay the blessings bestowed unto you and do something for others.
<br /><br />A blessing cannot be kept.  If it stops with you, then the blessing will disappear. The blessing will only keep working if it is continuously passed around. If you are a recipient of a blessing, keep the blessing working by being the source of blessing to other people.

<br />Through this life without effect;
<br />I often wonder if I'm truly
<br />Worth what I've been blessed.
<br /><br />I search through days that have been hard,
<br />To try to understand,
<br />The many trials that I have known,
<br />The life that I have had.
<br /><br />You see me in my daily grind,
<br />So confident and strong;
<br />Yet when I am alone, I question
<br />Just where I belong.
<br /><br />I often try too hard I find,
<br />To analyze and guess,
<br />To scrutinize, investigate
<br />My life I will confess.
<br /><br />For somewhere deeper, there must be
<br />Some meaning to this life,
<br />Some way to make a difference,
<br />Give a reason for this strife.
<br /><br />Is there some hidden meaning?
<br />Some agenda to be found?
<br />A greater purpose waiting
<br />If I care to hang around?
<br /><br />It teases and it taunts me,
<br />Always slightly out of sight;
<br />A hazy vision out of reach,
<br />Where darkness hides the light.
<br /><br />I struggle to bring clarity
<br />To what awaits me there,
<br />And yet this weak illusion
<br />Always fades before my stare.
<br /><br />It seems the harder that I try,
<br />To focus through the haze,
<br />Just serves to add more questions,
<br />Through my endless, tired gaze.
<br /><br />Perhaps I'm trying just too hard,
<br />To understand it all,
<br />For can we ever truly know
<br />Just what we have in store?
<br /><br />Each incident, each moment passed,
<br />Just adds upon the next,
<br />But in the end, will I find truth ...
<br />Or will I be perplexed?
<br /><br />Perhaps I make it harder
<br />Than it has to be sometimes,
<br />But will my searching bring to me
<br />My meaning over time?
<br /><br />Or will it leave me broken,
<br />And confused as I feel now,
<br />While questions bring no solitude,
<br />To this, my wrinkled brow.

<br />'Long roads less traveled as their way,
<br />Nor question choices made by them
<br />In days long past or nights long dim
<br />by words they spoke and did not say.
<br /><br />Each road is long, though short it seems,
<br />And credence gives each road a name
<br />Of fantasies sun-drenched in beams
<br />Or choices turned to darkened dreams,
<br />To where each road wends just the same.
<br /><br />From North to South, then back again,
<br />I followed birds like all the rest
<br />Escaping nature's snowy den
<br />On roads I've seen and places been,
<br />Forsaking roads that traveled West.
<br /><br />This journey grows now to its end,
<br />As road reflections lined in chrome
<br />Give way to roads with greater bend
<br />And empty signs that still pretend
<br />They point the way to home sweet home.
<br /><br />But all roads lead to where we go
<br />And where we go is where we've been,
<br />So home is just a word we know,
<br />That space in time most apropos
<br />For where we want to be again.
<br /><br />For even home, it seems to me,
<br />Is still a choice we all must face
<br />From day to day and endlessly,
<br />To choose if home is going to be
<br />Another road - or just a place.

<br />I feel a bond between us.
<br />A bond that should have taken years to build,
<br />Yet was built in a month or two.
<br />A bond that lifelong friends should have,
<br />Although most never do.
<br />A bond that I am glad to share with you...
<br />My Friend and Confidant.
<br /><br />You are not here in body and soul,
<br />But as a lighted rectangle.
<br />You come to me every day as
<br />A message on my screen,
<br />A message that I can rely on
<br />To cheer me up and make my day.
<br />Through a keyboard we share
<br />Our ups and downs.
<br /><br />I have opened my inner self to you, 
<br />And you have to me as well. 
<br />We have traded secrets and laughs, 
<br />As well as sorrows and pain. 
<br />I have never met you, but feel as if 
<br />I have known you most of my life. 
<br />To most this might sound silly, 
<br />But I assure them, it is not.

<br />When times are not so right.
<br />They come and go so frequently,
<br />You hope you pick one right.
<br /><br />The right one listens with both ears,
<br />And soothes your aching heart.
<br />The right one never questions you,
<br />When you seem to fall apart.
<br /><br />The friend for you is one who says,
<br />&quot;Be calm and let me help&quot;
<br />For there are some real bad days,
<br />When life hits you below the belt.
<br /><br />All friends are not forever,
<br />They are few and far between,
<br />But the few true friends you do find,
<br />Will never, ever leave.

<br />small grins, dubious eyebrows,
<br />oh--let the arguments begin!

<br />though the longer the mockery is,
<br />the harder it is revealing each other's identity.

<br />I asked if we could change it,

<br />deciding that nature will take its place

<br />Some good, some bad, some that left me lost,
<br />I have reaped the harvest of my maker
<br />Sewn my seeds at sometimes-great cost.
<br /><br />I have met with over-powering obstacles
<br />Presenting challenges for me to surpass
<br />My willfulness to live my life to the fullest
<br />Sometimes gave me a kick in the ass.
<br /><br />I have made many foolish mistakes
<br />So many that I can no longer count
<br />They served as lessons of life well learned
<br />Steps toward problems I was forced to mount.
<br /><br />I’ve made enemies and friends aplenty
<br />Some who loved, some filled with ire and hate
<br />The ones who made the biggest impression on me
<br />Were those who lovingly guided my fate.
<br /><br />Growing old reduces the numerous chances 
<br />Of making too many thoughtless mistakes
<br />But the past ever returns to haunt me
<br />With bitter memories like poisonous snakes.
<br /><br />I keep reminding myself that retrospect 
<br />Can’t change the direction of roads I took 
<br />Or erase the wrongs made in the moment
<br />That felt right through the eyes I then looked.
<br /><br />I have learned that knowledge is not swift or insightful
<br />It comes like a thief in the night at its own pace
<br />Resembling a blind man clumsily feeling his way
<br />On a rocky road where no one wins the race.
<br /><br />From early youth into adolescence and adulthood
<br />Every experience presents a moral and ethical choice
<br />A skill children need to be taught from an early age
<br />Enabling reliance upon that conscientious inner voice.
<br /><br />I cannot fault the mistakes of my past 
<br />Which served as stepping-stones to a better life
<br />Inspiring me to do better by stepping up to the challenge
<br />Of overcoming inevitable strife.
<br /><br />I’ve learned mistakes can never be undone
<br />It would be foolish to even try
<br />But if used as a textbook toward mature growth
<br />Worthwhile knowledge is gained until the day  i die.

Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, if they be events, illnesses or relationships, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. 
<br /><br />If someone hurts you, betrays you , or breaks you heart, forgive them. For they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to who you open your heart to.
<br /><br />If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and opening your heart and eyes to things you would have never seen or felt without them.
<br /><br />Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again.
<br /><br />Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, no one else will believe in you either.
<br /><br />You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.

<br />45 years old highly educated son. Suddenly a crow perched on their
<br />window.
<br /><br />The Father asked his Son, &quot;What is this?&quot;
<br /><br />The Son replied &quot;It is a crow&quot;.
<br /><br />After a few minutes, the Father asked his Son the 2nd time, &quot;What is
<br />this?&quot;
<br /><br />The Son said &quot;Father, I have just now told you &quot;It's a crow&quot;.
<br /><br />After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son the 3rd time,
<br /><br />What is this?&quot;
<br /><br />At this time some ex-pression of irritation was felt in the Son's tone
<br />when he said to his Father with a rebuff. &quot;It's a crow, a crow&quot;.
<br /><br />A little after, the Father again asked his Son t he 4th time, &quot;What is
<br />this?&quot;
<br /><br />This time the Son shouted at his Father, &quot;Why do you keep asking me the
<br />same question again and again, although I have told you so many times
<br />'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?&quot;
<br /><br />A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old
<br />tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On
<br />opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page. When the son read it, the
<br />following words were written in the diary :-
<br /><br />&quot;Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a
<br />crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was,
<br />and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him
<br />lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23
<br />times. I did not at all feel irritated I rather felt affection for my
<br />innocent child&quot;.
<br /><br />While the little child asked him 23 times &quot;What is this&quot;, the Father
<br />had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and
<br />when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the
<br />Son felt irritated and annoyed.
<br /><br />So..
<br /><br />If your parents attain old age, do not repulse them or look at them as
<br />a burden, but speak to them a gracious word, be cool, obedient, humble
<br />and kind to them. Be considerate to your parents.

<br /><br />will jump overboard; six will stay on deck 
<br /><br />without joy or love because of children, 
<br /><br />careers, family, and church; and only two will 
<br /><br />enjoy a compleat marriage.
<br /><br />God created us for relationship, and marriage is one of these. Marriage is His idea, intending it to be closest and most sacred human bond.
<br /><br />Many couples fall in love, marry and assume that the job is completed. They tend to feel that everything else will work out automatically. But hardly anything could be further from the truth. A successful marriage does not come spontaneously or by chance.
<br /><br />Someone has defined marriage as &quot;the total commitment of the total person for a total way of life.&quot; Such a definition assumes that a couple will work toward goals that they had in mind when they get married. To marry for convenience, to escape from a bad home situation, or to give a baby a name is not an adequate goal for a successful marriage. When couple agree to walk together, they accept each other's beliefs, hopes and desires.
<br /><br />Plato used a ladder to illustrate growth in the marriage relationship. The two upright sides of the ladder stand for the husband and wife, and each rung represents something that draws and holds them together in inseparable companionship. The lowest rung is physical attraction, and the highest rung, pure love for God. Each rung of the ladder depends on the other rungs, and thus all become important in order to maintain the unity of the ladder of a compleat marriage
<br /><br />&quot;To gain a proper understanding of the marriage relation is the work of a lifetime. 
<br /><br />Those who marry enter a school from which they are never in this life to be graduated.
<br /><br />The real union of the two in wedlock is the work of the afteryears.&quot;
<br /><br />God himself established marriage, and only with help can couples stay together for a full and rewarding lifetime.
<br /><br />&quot;And they shall be one flesh&quot; (Genesis 2:24) tells, in words as old as the human race, the highest goal in marriage, for marriage is a union of love encompassing all areas of life: physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. 
<br /><br />&quot;Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh, what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&quot; &quot;Matthew 19:6.

<br />When paintings have no color, words dont rhyme
<br />And thats why Ive travelled far
<br />Cause I come so together where you are
<br /><br />And all of the things that I said that I wanted
<br />Come rushing by in my head when Im with you
<br />14 joys and a will to be merry
<br />And all of the things that we say are very
<br />Sentimental gentle wind
<br />Blowing through my life again
<br />Sentimental lady
<br />Gentle one
<br /><br />You are here and warm
<br />But I could look away and youd be gone
<br />Cause we live in a time
<br />When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
<br />And thats why Ive travelled far
<br />Cause I come so together where you are
<br /><br />Yes and all of the things that I said that I wanted
<br />Come rushing by in my head when Im with you
<br />14 joys and a will to be merry
<br />And all of the things that we say are very
<br />Sentimental gentle wind
<br />Blowing through my life again
<br />Sentimental lady
<br />Gentle one
<br /><br />Sentimental gentle wind
<br />Blowing through my life again
<br />Sentimental lady
<br />Gentle one
<br /><br />Sentimental gentle wind
<br />Blowing through my life again
<br />Sentimental lady
<br />Gentle one
<br /><br />Well sentimental gentle wind
<br />Blowing through my life again
<br />Sentimental lady
<br />Gentle one
