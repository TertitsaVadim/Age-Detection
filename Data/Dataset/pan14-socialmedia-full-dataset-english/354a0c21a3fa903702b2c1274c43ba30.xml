<br /><br />By JOHN LELAND
<br /><br />Published: January 12, 2006
<br /><br />AT a coffee shop in TriBeCa one morning two weeks ago, David Minh Wong, age 7, was in constant motion. He played with quarters on the table. He dropped them on the floor. He leaned on his mother and walked away.
<br /><br />&quot;Tell him I'm strong,&quot; he said to his mother, Yolanda Badillo, 50. She sat in a booth with a neighbor, who was there with her goddaughter.
<br /><br />&quot;I woke up at 2:16 this morning, and it wasn't raining,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />&quot;I'm getting bored,&quot; he said.
<br /><br />At David's public school, where he is in a program for gifted and talented second graders, a teacher told Ms. Badillo that he is arrogant for a boy his age, and teachers since preschool have described him as bright but sometimes disruptive. But Ms. Badillo, a homeopath and holistic health counselor, has her own assessment. To her David's traits - his intelligence, empathy and impatience - make him an &quot;indigo&quot; child.
<br /><br />&quot;He told me when he was 6 months old that he was going to have trouble in school because they wouldn't know where to fit him,&quot; she said, adding that he told her this through his energy, not in words. &quot;Our consciousness is changing, it's expanding, and the indigos are here to show us the way,&quot; Ms. Badillo said. &quot;We were much more connected with the creator before, and we're trying to get back to that connection.&quot;
<br /><br />If you have not been in an alternative bookstore lately, it is possible that you have missed the news about indigo children. They represent &quot;perhaps the most exciting, albeit odd, change in basic human nature that has ever been observed and documented,&quot; Lee Carroll and Jan Tober write in &quot;The Indigo Children: The New Kids Have Arrived&quot; (Hay House). The book has sold 250,000 copies since 1999 and has spawned a cottage industry of books about indigo children.
<br /><br />Hay House said it has sold 500,000 books on indigo children. A documentary, &quot;Indigo Evolution,&quot; is scheduled to open on about 200 screens - at churches, yoga centers, college campuses and other places - on Jan. 27 (locations at <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiritualcinemanetwork.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.spiritualcinemanetwork.com</a>).
<br /><br />Indigo children were first described in the 1970's by a San Diego parapsychologist, Nancy Ann Tappe, who noticed the emergence of children with an indigo aura, a vibrational color she had never seen before. This color, she reasoned, coincided with a new consciousness.
<br /><br />In &quot;The Indigo Children,&quot; Mr. Carroll and Ms. Tober define the phenomenon. Indigos, they write, share traits like high I.Q., acute intuition, self-confidence, resistance to authority and disruptive tendencies, which are often diagnosed as attention-deficit disorder, known as A.D.D., or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D.
<br /><br />Offered as a guide for &quot;the parents of unusually bright and active children,&quot; the book includes common criticisms of today's child rearing: that children are overmedicated; that schools are not creative environments, especially for bright students; and that children need more time and attention from their parents. But the book seeks answers to mainstream parental concerns in the paranormal.
<br /><br />&quot;To me these children are the answers to the prayers we all have for peace,&quot; said Doreen Virtue, a former psychotherapist for adolescents who now writes books and lectures on indigo children. She calls the indigos a leap in human evolution. &quot;They're vigilant about cleaning the earth of social ills and corruption, and increasing integrity,&quot; Ms. Virtue said. &quot;Other generations tried, but then they became apathetic. This generation won't, unless we drug them into submission with Ritalin.&quot;
<br /><br />To skeptics the concept of indigo children belongs in the realm of wishful thinking and New Age credulity. &quot;All of us would prefer not to have our kids labeled with a psychiatric disorder, but in this case it's a sham diagnosis,&quot; said Russell Barkley, a research professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. &quot;There's no science behind it. There are no studies.&quot;
<br /><br />Dr. Barkley likened the definition of indigo children to an academic exercise called &quot;Barnum statements,&quot; after P. T. Barnum, in which a person is given a list of generic psychological characteristics and becomes convinced that they apply especially to him or her. The traits attributed to indigo children, he said, are so general that they &quot;could describe most of the people most of the time,&quot; which means that they don't describe anything.
<br /><br />Parents who attribute their children's inattention or disruptive behavior to vibrational energy, he said, risk delaying proper diagnosis and treatment that might help them.
<br /><br />To indigos and their parents, however, such skepticism is the usual resistance to any new and revolutionary idea. America has always had a soft spot for the supernatural. A November 2005 poll by Harris Interactive found that one American in five believes he or she has been reincarnated; 40 percent believe in ghosts; 68 percent believe in angels. It is not surprising then that indigo literature, which incorporates some of these beliefs along with common anxieties about child psychology, has found a receptive audience.
<br /><br />Annette Piper, a mother of two in Memphis, said that she had planned to go to medical school until she realized she was an indigo, able to tell what was wrong with people by touching them. Like a lot of others who describe themselves as indigos, she was also sensitive to chemicals and fluorescent lights. Instead of going to medical school, she became an intuitive healer, directing the energy fields around people, and opened a New Age store called Spiritual Freedom.
<br /><br />Her daughter Alexandra, 10, is also an indigo, she said. They play games to cultivate their telepathic powers, but at school Alexandra struggles, Ms. Piper said. &quot;She has trouble finishing work in school and wants to argue with the teacher if she thinks she's right,&quot; Ms. Piper said. &quot;I don't think she's found out what her gifts are. From the influence in school and friends she lays off these abilities. She's a little afraid of them.&quot;
<br /><br />Problems in school are common for indigos, said Alex Perkel, who runs the ReBirth Esoteric Science Center in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a bilingual (Russian-English) center dedicated to &quot;the knowledge of ancient esoteric schools and Eastern science,&quot; according to its Web site (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esotericinfo.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.esotericinfo.com</a>).
<br /><br />Last year the center organized a class for indigo children but canceled it when families dropped out for economic reasons.
<br /><br />&quot;A lot of people don't understand the children because the children are very smart,&quot; Mr. Perkel said. &quot;They have knowledge like our teachers. They don't want to go to school, No. 1, because they don't need the knowledge they can get from school. So parents bring them to psychologists, and psychologists start giving them pills to take out their will and memory. We developed a special program to help them understand that they came to this planet to change the consciousness because they have guides from a higher world.&quot;
<br /><br />Stephen Hinshaw, a professor and the chairman of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, acknowledged that &quot;there is a legitimate concern that we are overmedicalizing normal childhood, particularly with A.D.H.D.&quot; But, he said, research shows that even gifted children with attention-deficit problems do better with more structure in the classroom, not less.
<br /><br />&quot;If you conduct a very open classroom, kids with A.D.H.D. may fit in better, because everyone's running around, but there's no evidence that it helps children with A.D.H.D. learn. On the other hand if you have a more traditional classroom, with consistent tasks and expectations and rewards, kids with A.D.H.D. may have a harder time fitting in at first, but in the long run there's evidence that it helps their learning.&quot;
<br /><br />Julia Tuchman, a partner in Neshama Healing in Manhattan, who works with a lot of indigo children and adults, said it was important for their families not to turn away from traditional psychology and medicine.
<br /><br />&quot;I'm very holistically oriented, but many people who come here I send to doctors,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm not against medication at all. I just think it's overused.&quot; When parents take children to her for treatment - she practices electromagnetic field balancing, a touch-free massage that purports to tune a person's electromagnetic field - she said that just telling the children that they have special gifts is often a healing gesture.
<br /><br />&quot;Can you imagine a child going up to his parents and saying, 'I'm talking to an angel,' or 'I'm talking to someone who's deceased'?&quot; Ms. Tuchman asked. &quot;A lot of them have no one to talk to.&quot; She, like others who see indigos, sees them as a reason for hope.
<br /><br />Even disruptive behavior has a purpose, said Marjorie Jackson, a tai chi and yoga teacher in Altadena, Calif., who said that her son, Andrew, is an indigo. Andrew, now 25, was not disruptive as a child, she said, but in her practice she sees indigos who are.
<br /><br />&quot;The purpose of the disruptive ones is to overload the system so the school will be inspired to change,&quot; Ms. Jackson said. &quot;The kids may seem like they have A.D.D. or A.D.H.D. What that is, is that the stimulus given to them, their inner being is not interested in it. But if you give them something that harmonizes with the broad intention that their inner self has for them, they won't be disruptive.&quot;
<br /><br />She said that schools should treat children more like adults, rather than placing them in &quot;fear-based, constrictive, no-choice environments, where they explode.&quot;
<br /><br />Ms. Jackson compared people who do not recognize indigos to Muggles, the name used by J. K. Rowling in the Harry Potter books to describe ordinary people who have no connection with magic. &quot;I would say 90 percent of the world is like the Muggles,&quot; she said. &quot;You don't talk about this stuff with them because it's going to scare them.&quot;
<br /><br />In the TriBeCa coffee shop, David Minh Wong continued to play with his coins and talk to his mother. Ms. Badillo and her neighbor Sandra McCoy said they have family members who don't believe in the indigo idea. Ms. McCoy sat with her goddaughter, Jasmine Washington, 14. In contrast to David, Jasmine listened serenely, waiting for questions.
<br /><br />Yet Jasmine too is an indigo child, Ms. McCoy said: &quot;I always knew there was something different about her. Then when I saw something about indigos on television, I knew what it was.&quot; Like many other indigos Jasmine is home-schooled.
<br /><br />For Jasmine, who often sensed she was different from other children, especially in the public schools, the designation of indigo is a comfort.
<br /><br />&quot;The kids now are very different, so it's good that there's a name for it, and people pay attention to what's different about them,&quot; Jasmine said. Like the women at the table she said that indigos have a special purpose: &quot;To help the world come together again. If something bad happens, I always think I can fix it. Since we have these abilities, we can help the world.&quot;

<br /><br />by Debra Hegerle
<br /><br />(&quot;The Indigo Child is  a boy or girl who displays a new and unusual  set of psychological attributes, revealing a  pattern of behavior generally undocumented  before. This pattern has singularly unique  factors that call for parents and teachers to  change their treatment and upbringing of these  kids to assist them in achieving balance and  harmony in their lives, and to help them avoid  frustration.&quot; 
<br />                                                -- Lee Carroll &amp; Jan Tober)
<br /><br />I have a  seven-year-old Indigo son. I've been working as a teacher's  aide in his classrooms through preschool, kindergarten, and  now first grade, and I've observed his interactions with  Indigos and non-Indigos of all ages. It's been interesting! In  fact, trying to put it all down in writing has been a  challenge because the children do so many subtle things.
<br /><br />Indigos  process their emotions differently than non Indigos because  they have high self-esteem and strong integrity. They can read  you like an open book and quickly notice and neutralize any  hidden agendas or attempts to manipulate them, however subtly.  In fact, they can see your hidden agendas even if you can't!  They have inherently strong determination to work things  through for themselves and only want outside guidance if it's presented to them with respect and within a format of true choice. They prefer to work situations out for themselves.
<br /><br />They come in  with their intentions and gifts easily identifiable from  birth. They can suck up knowledge like a sponge, especially if  they like or are drawn to a subject, which makes them very  advanced in their areas of interest. Experiencing life helps  them learn best, so they create the experiences they need to  help them with their current problem or area where they need  to grow. They respond best when treated like a respected  adult.
<br /><br />Not only are  they masters at intuitively picking up on hidden agendas or  motives, but they are equally masterful at turning those  agendas back onto the people using them, especially their  parents. Psychological &quot;button pushing&quot; often causes  them to be labeled as nonconformists. If they notice that  there is a hidden motive behind your attempt to get them to do  something, they will resist strongly and feel perfectly  justified in doing so. From their point of view, if you're not  doing your work in the relationship, they can challenge you on  it.
<br /><br />When I called  them good &quot;button pushers&quot; what I really meant is  that they're working with us adults to help us recognize where  we are holding and using old, subtle patterns to manipulate  them, which used to work but will no longer. So if you are  constantly getting resistance from an Indigo, check yourself  first. They may be holding up a mirror for you, or be asking  you, in a nonconformist way, for help in finding new boundaries,  fine-tuning their own skills or talents, or going to the next  level of growth.
<br /><br />Indigos have  innate healing abilities that are usually already active;  however, they may not know that they are using them! The most  spectacular thing I observed was how they formed groups,  adjusting and spacing themselves, especially around another  child who might have been sick or upset — sitting and blending  their energy field with that child's. Most often, they paired  up one on one, but sometimes they formed groups and sat in either a triangular or diamond-shaped pattern. It wasn't done  in an obvious way, but very subtly. When finished, they were  off to something else.
<br /><br />It was  amazing. They just did it, but they didn't want to discuss it;  in some cases, they weren't even consciously aware of what  they were doing or why! It was so natural to them that if a  child needed something from the Indigos, they just went and  sat next to them for a while, not even necessarily talking,  and then they separated.
<br /><br />Another  interesting thing was that, off and on throughout the year,  the Indigos went through periods of attracting and repelling  each other, or periods of really needing each other's company  and then of not needing it. I'm not totally clear on  this, but it seems to coincide with individual personal  development. The closeness and concern they had for each other  was never lost during those periods of separation, but they  wouldn't go back together, either, until all was right for  them.
<br /><br />I'll give  you one little story regarding my Indigo son. Let me give you  the background: My husband and his family are Chinese  Americans, and I am of German/Finnish heritage.  My husband's family places great emphasis on education, and  the siblings were brought up with a strong need to succeed.  This still sometimes spills over onto their children, in the  form of whose are better, smarter, and faster. My husband and  I agree about not participating in all this competitiveness,  but that doesn't stop it from happening around us. To top it  off, consider that out of the five grandchildren, my son is  the only boy — that is, the only male heir — and I  think you'll get a pretty clear picture of the undercurrents.
<br /><br />We were at my  in-laws' house on Christmas day, and my son, who was almost  four years old at the time, was showing off his Millennium  Falcon™ (a Star Wars™ toy that was meant for a  six-year-old) that he had received from us that morning. It  was the giant one that opens up, and inside were all kinds of  little compartments, similarly but not identically shaped. He  wasn't interested in that portion of the toy at that time. He  was only interested in pretending to fly it and shoot the  rockets — living out his fantasies. One of his uncles asked to  play with it and proceeded to take all the little doors off of  all the compartments. He handed them to my son in a pile and asked, &quot;Can you put this back together?&quot;
<br /><br />It was a  setup! All the doors were the same color, and the differences  in shape and size were very subtle. Oh, and the tone of voice  he used — like butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. This uncle  has three daughters and a whole lot of personal agendas, so  his actions were not a total surprise, but . . . I absolutely  love what happened next.
<br /><br />I started to  intervene, and my son turned and looked me, dead in the eye,  with a look on his face I'll never forget. He looked at me to  see what I was going to do, and in the instant that it took  for him to read my intentions, which were of Mommy Lioness —  I'm  not going to let this happen to my son — he responded just  as quickly. He gave me a look that said, Back off, Mom, I'm  taking this one on myself, and I felt the energy shift as  he took command of the entire room. Everyone stopped talking  and turned to look over at him. He calmly  said to his uncle, &quot;I don't know. I've never done that  before; let me see.&quot; Then he proceeded to put that thing  back together quickly and accurately!
<br /><br />When he was  done, the energy shifted again, and he looked over at me as if  to ask, &quot;Was that okay?&quot; I just smiled and said,  &quot;Good job.&quot; Everyone there caught the double  meaning, including his uncle, who has never since done  anything like that to my son or to anyone else's child in our  presence.
<br /><br />No direct  comments were made that night about the situation. We all just  knew that we were each going to process it individually and  privately, each getting our own lesson — all because this  little one decided to learn for himself.
<br /><br />Indigos are  born masters — each and every one! We have to understand that  they fully expect every one of us to do what they are doing  naturally, and if we don't, they keep pushing our buttons  until we get it right — that is, until we become the masters  of our own lives. So when my son did his thing, he taught  everyone there a quiet lesson, including himself.
<br /><br />For me, the  lesson was, let him go; despite his age, he is capable.  Stay aware and watch the process. The process in this case  was very interesting. He quickly and accurately sized up the  situation, and determined his response based on what he wanted  to experience. After making sure he had backup, he chose to  confront the person directly, and at that point, he  immediately called up all the energies necessary to complete  the task. Afterward, he released it all back just as quickly  and went back to his own business.
<br /><br />I've witnessed  many similar situations that he or other Indigos handled in  the same way. They will size up a situation and then choose  their actions based on what they want to experience at the  time. The only adjustments to this pattern that I've seen were  based on what type of backup they had. In a safe environment,  they have consistently used this pattern.
<br /><br />Safety is very  important, because all children need to feel safe to fully  explore their universe. For Indigos, safety means that it's  okay to do things differently! Giving everyone this space is  the best thing we can do for children and for ourselves.
<br /><br />What is an indigo Child?
<br /><br />As a summary, here are the ten attributes that best describe this new kind of child, the Indigo Child
<br />	• 	They come into the world with a feeling of royalty (and often act like it)
<br /><br />• 	They have a feeling of &quot;deserving to be here,&quot; and are surprised when others don't share that. 
<br />	• 	Self-worth is not a big issue. They often tell the parents &quot;who they are.&quot; 
<br />	• 	They have difficulty with absolute authority (authority without explanation or choice).
<br /><br />• 	They simply will not do certain things; for example, waiting in line is difficult for them.
<br /><br />• 	They get frustrated with systems that are ritually oriented and don't require creative thought.
<br /><br />• 	They often see better ways of doing things, both at home and in school, which makes them seem like &quot;system busters&quot; (nonconforming to any system).
<br /><br />• 	They seem antisocial unless they are with their own kind. If there are no others of like consciousness around them, they often turn inward, feeling like no other human understands them. School is often extremely difficult for them socially.
<br /><br />• 	They will not respond to &quot;guilt&quot; discipline (&quot;Wait till your father gets home and finds out what you did&quot<img class="smiley" src="http://www.pan.net/smilies/wink.gif" alt=":)" />.
<br /><br />• 	They are not shy in letting you know what they need.
<br /><br />Beliefs
<br />The Indigo child movement believes that the children in question are born with an empathic connection to Earth and others' thoughts. However, due to natural limits in infant communication, Indigo children's supposed abilities (empathy, telepathy, extra-sensory perception and extra-normal perception) are often suppressed by negative parental or societal influence. The Indigo child movement therefore encourages parents to support those children in whom can be seen traits which are often labeled as negative by mainstream authorities but as positive by the Indigo child.[citation needed]
<br />Adherents believe that this new type of child has come forward for a reason; most often suggested is that they will improve the world in some way. The changes generally discussed involve bringing peace, toppling corrupt institutions, and a shift from allopathic medicine to a greater understanding of more natural alternatives. Indigo children are said by proponents to be more in touch with something called the &quot;Universal Truth&quot;, and do not tolerate or understand behaviors or systems that are not in harmony with it.[citation needed]
<br />Indigo children are sometimes said to possess an extreme longevity,[citation needed] but given the birth dates claimed by proponents, experimental verifiability of this belief is impossible.

<br />Many teachers, day care workers, child psychologists and others who work with children have noticed over the past ten/fifteen years that kids seem to be different. What’s different about them? They’re much more active, demanding, outspoken, unwilling to conform and unresponsive to adult standards like “Because I said so.”
<br /><br />There is a theory about these children that you may have heard about: Indigo children. The story goes that in the early 1990s, a child psychologist who could see the energy fields around people (auras) started noticing that many of the children she was seeing had predominantly indigo auras. As she began paying more attention to this, she began to notice that all these “Indigo children” (as she dubbed them) demonstrated similar personality characteristics and were generally very challenging for parents and teachers. She began to invest more energy into understanding these children, and since that time, many books and resources have come out to help parents, educators and childcare workers understand these “spirited” children.
<br /><br />A very interesting thing that has come to light is the purpose of Indigo children: according to various sources, they are on the planet at this time as “system busters”; they are here to point out the flaws of society’s systems (families, education etc) and force change.
<br /><br />The Ritalin epidemic which has come about in the last decade seems a suspicious confirmation of the “indigo” phenomenon. As more and more of the not-willing-to-conform children have been introduced into the school system, there has been a greater and greater need to find ways to make these children sit down, be quiet and listen. Widespread diagnoses of ADHD and the prescription of Ritalin in mind-numbing quantities seems an obvious sign that something is amiss! But maybe the problem is not the children but the system?
<br /><br />There are undoubtedly children out there who truly are ADHD, and in some cases, Ritalin may be necessary and helpful. However, until other possibilities have been fully explored, parents may want to hold off accepting quick labels and easy drugs.

<br />nobody home. I went over. Nobody was home.
<br /><br />If it weren't for pick-pocketers I'd have no sex life at all.
<br /><br />And we were poor too. Why if I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have 
<br />nothing to play with.
<br /><br />During sex my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.
<br />Just the other night she called me from a hotel.
<br /><br />One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging
<br />naked. I said to the guy .... Hey buddy .... why are you doing that?
<br />He said....
<br />Because you came home early.
<br /><br />Its been a rough day.
<br />I got up this morning..... put on a shirt and a button fell off.
<br />I picked up my briefcase and the handle came off.
<br />I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.
<br /><br />When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up.
<br /><br />I could tell that my parents hated me.
<br />My bath toys were a toaster and a radio.
<br /><br />My mother never breast fed me.
<br />She told me that she only liked me as a friend.
<br /><br />My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet.
<br /><br />When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to
<br />my father ....
<br />I'm very sorry. We did everything we could......But he pulled through.
<br /><br />My mother had morning sickness-after I was born.
<br /><br />I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger
<br />to my father. He said he wanted more proof.
<br /><br />Once when I was lost..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me
<br />find my parents. I said to him .... do you think we'll ever find them?
<br />He said ...
<br />I don't know kid .... there are so many places they can hide.
<br /><br />My wife made me join a bridge club.
<br />I jump off next Tuesday.
<br /><br />I worked in a pet shop and people kept asking
<br />how big I'd get.
<br /><br />I went to see my doctor. Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in
<br />the mirror... I feel like throwing up; What's wrong with me?
<br />He said...I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.
<br /><br />When I was born the doctor took one look at my face ... turned me over
<br />and said. Look ... twins!
<br /><br />I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills.
<br />My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.
