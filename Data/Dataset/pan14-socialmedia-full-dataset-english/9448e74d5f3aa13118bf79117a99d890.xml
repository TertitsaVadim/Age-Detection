<br /><br />In the recent years the expense for organizing a good wedding reception has sky rocketed, with most people going way beyond their means to have their wedding organized in a royal style. Although the recent economic recession has affected this trend to some extent, couples are still willing to go over-the-top to arrange a perfect party for their friends and acquaintances on their special day. However, ace caterer Rhona Silver feels that while it is good idea to celebrate your special day in a unique manner, breaking your bank for the same is definitely not a sensible decision.
<br /><br /><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuZXdvbWVubmV0d29yay5jb20vdGFnL3Job25hLXNpbHZlci8_" target="_blank">Rhona Silver</a> feels that a major reason for couples going over-budget while planning their wedding reception is their ignorance of the catering business and concepts. In fact, most couples feel that hiring catering services is not much different from hiring a wedding dress designer or a hair stylist. Sadly, this often causes them to spend much more than their budget. They rarely realize the fact that when it comes to catering, the cost is calculated on the basis of price per person and this does not include the service charges. 
<br /><br />According to Rhona Silver, the most important aspect of organizing a great reception is not focused on choosing the right caterer or the best venue or even a perfect menu. Rather it is more about the people attending the reception and their ability to have fun and enjoy themselves. While the kind of food being served or even the music being played is critical for the success of any party, it is the basic emotion of love and feeling of happiness for a loved one that really sets the mood of the party. Other aspects such as the type of decoration, the table linen and china or even the choice of centerpieces only help to enhance the sense of pleasure and celebration. And in order to make these things perfect, it is vital to add a little bit of personal touch and creativity.

And when it comes to partying, it is quite natural for most people to look up to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20vcGVvcGxlL1Job25hLVNpbHZlci83MDY5MTkxODE_" target="_blank">Rhona Silver</a> for innovative ideas and party flavors, which are sure to make the get-together really successful and enjoyable. Apart from planning the menu, there are numerous other things that party organizers need to consider while planning a barbecue party, most of which are listed below. 
<br /><br />1. Since summer is the time when most people like to party outdoors, it is vital to ensure that the space available is big enough to accommodate all the guests without giving any feeling of being overcrowded. If possible make seating arrangements for at least half the number of people you expect to attend the party.
<br /><br />2. Set up the barbeque oven at the farthest corner of the party venue so that any smokes and fumes that arise while preparing the food do not spoil the ambience of the party. Moreover, it is also ensure safety for those who are allergic to smoke. 
<br /><br />3. While deciding the menu for the party makes sure that you don’t ignore traditional barbeque dishes such a potato salad and corn on the cob. Even top notch caterers like Rhona Silver do not plan a barbecue party without including these classics.  
<br /><br />4. In case you are preparing the barbeque dishes on your own, make sure that you make some preparations in advance so that you do not spend the entire time over the hot grill and completely miss out the fun of the party. 
<br /><br />5. Since most barbeque parties are planned to enjoy a relaxing time with family and friends, make sure to plan your event on a weekend or a public holiday so that your guests can really let their hair down and enjoy the party to the fullest.

By this measure, Rhona Silver is undoubtedly the most successful catering entrepreneur across America. However, contrary to what many people think, catering was definitely not the only profession that Ms. Silver opted for. In fact, despite having assisted her parents in their small catering business as a child, she forayed into professional catering only after her marriage broke down. 
<br /><br />Even though <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS8jIS9SaG9uYV9TaWx2ZXI_" target="_blank">Rhona Silver</a> had gained considerable knowledge and experience in the catering business at a very young age, her craving for knowledge made her study for a teaching degree at Lehman College. A marriage and two kids later, she enrolled at Hafostra University to study for her law degree. She completed her course in just two years, although she had to take two double summer sessions for the same. Her mother offered constant support by coming over to look after her kids, who were quite young at the time. She even worked a teacher and taught students from elementary school to graduate school. 
<br /><br />When her marriage finally ended in 1990, leaving her in charge of her two young children, Rhona Silver reassessed her options in life. She did not have the inclination to take up teaching as a career option and hence choose to opt for catering business, which she was sure she would be able to excel at. She chose to search for something that the market was missing. She did not have to search for long as she soon realized that the growing Jewish community in Long Island was craving for an upscale glatt kosher catering services provider. Although Ms. Silver did not know much about such services, she made it a point to familiarize herself with all its aspects before setting up her own glatt kosher catering service and the rest, as they say, is history.

<br /><br />A lot of people like to attend parties and events as they not only provide relaxation and refreshment to the mind and the body but also give a chance to catch up with family, friends and acquaintances. However, while some events are really thrilling and exciting, others simply make you want to run back home. According to Catering Guru Rhona Silver, arranging a successful event is possible only by making sure that various aspects of the function have been planned and taken care of beforehand. People who have attended even a single event organized by her would surely agree with this idea. 
<br /><br />For years, event organizers have looked up to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS8jIS9SaG9uYV9TaWx2ZXI_" target="_blank">Rhona Silver</a> for both guidance and inspiration to organize truly remarkable events. She has practically demonstrated that all aspects of event organization including the choice of timing and venue, the decoration and style, the menu options and the music go hand in hand to ensure the success of an event. Even the slightest shortcoming in even one of these aspects can make all the difference between success and failure of a get-together. As such event organizers need to be doubly sure that all the arrangements are not only up to highest quality standards but also as per client requirements and satisfaction. While it is important for event organizers to use their creativity and imagination to make the event unique, it is equally important to remain mindful of the budget limitations and the personal preferences of the clients and their guests. 
<br /><br />Rhona Silver has also proved that organizing an event successfully requires professionals to be both patient and hard working. It is vital to understand the importance of team work and team spirit and give due respect to even seemingly insignificant worker for his or her contribution. At the same time, professionals also need to develop the flair for multitasking besides familiarizing themselves with the various aspects of event organization. This not only helps them to handle and delegate tasks in a better manner but also to keep their team motivated by their personal involvement.

Even as child she learned to cope with difficulties and face them boldly all thanks to the strong values and morals instilled in her by her parents. The experience of less than pleasant marriage, disagreeable divorce and the responsibility of raising her two kids on her own seemed to only have enhanced her inner strength.

Be it her parents or her two children, Rhona’s family feel great pride and honor in having her as a part of their lives. She herself considers her family to be her greatest strength and support system, without whose constant encouragement and guidance she feels that she couldn’t have achieved what she has today. 
<br /><br />As a child Rhona Silver helped and supported her parents in their catering business, even if it meant no free time for herself. Unlike other children, she rarely went out to play but this was the least of her concerns as she felt that she was doing the important job of helping her parents to make their clients feel happy and satisfied. She even endured the hardships of a difficult marriage without once complaining to her parents for the fear of upsetting them or making them worried and concerned. 
<br /><br />Her dedication towards her children as a mother is also quite exemplary. After getting divorce from her estranged husband, Rhona Silver neither indulged in self pity nor did she seek another man’s support to care and provide for her two small kids. Rather, she chose the unconventional path of venturing into the catering business and proving her worth along with handling all the responsibilities of bringing up her kids. Her dedication and efforts towards providing the best upbringing to her kids ensured that her son and daughter not only received the best education but also inherited the great value systems and sense of morality of their mother. 
<br /><br />While Rhona Silver has achieved remarkable success as a professional caterer, she is no less than a shining star and a constant source of inspiration for her family.

Rather it was the one thing that she was most passionate about as she loved every moment and every aspect of the business. Born and raised in the midst of the smells and sounds of a small catering business owned by her immigrant parents in Bronx, N.Y., the business virtually ran in the blood of Ms. Silver. She started helping her parents, when she was just 10 years old and was comfortable and even eager to participate in everything, be it working in the coat room and the back of the house or learning to cook and make platters. 
<br /><br />While other kids of her age went to play outside, she used to hang around her parents imbibing the tricks of the trade and sweating it out along with them. Today, years later she recalls those times as the happiest and most memorable moments she shared with her loved ones. It was also during this time that she learned the importance of paying attention to detail and the fact that the catering business was a one act show where there is no scope of second chances.

Importance of perfect presentation was realized as she learned that while it might be possible to re-create a party, it was impossible to bring back the special moments that could be ruined due to a minor catering error, a truth she lives by even today.

As the successful catering entrepreneur, Rhona Silver has proven more than once that caterers need to be actively involved in the various aspects of their business to ensure its consistent growth. One of these aspects is determining the cost of a catering job. The costing of a catering job is dependent on various factors, prominent among them being the location of the event, its starting time and duration, expected number of guests and their preferences if any. 
<br /><br />Apart from the above mentioned factors, there are other commercial issues that need to be taken into consideration while determining the cost of a catering job. The first of these is the current average market price of similar events organized by other caterers. This provides the caterers with a reference point while planning their pricing strategy and help them in determining the most competitive price for their services. Another important factor to be considered is the type of event and the catering service sought by the client. While established caterers like <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yaG9uYXNpbHZlci51cy8_" target="_blank">Rhona Silver</a> can afford to offer a fixed price for their services irrespective of the type of catering job, for caterers who are just starting out, offering a flexible price range according to the type and scale of the events is a great way of getting settled in the field.   
<br /><br />A major issue to be considered while deciding the cost of a catering job is the profit margin. For this, it is vital to take into account all the expenses incurred during the planning and organization of the event. The ultimate pricing strategy followed by renowned caterers such as Rhona Silver, is to mix the various factors while keeping in mind the market base of their business as well as the background of their clients. For caterers still trying to establish their business, it is vital to ensure that their services are far better than their costing for the same at least until the time they create their own niche.
