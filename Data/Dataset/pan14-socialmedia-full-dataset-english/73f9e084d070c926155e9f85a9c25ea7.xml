Other than the kinds of authoring tools used by web developers and designers for e-commerce websites, there are also other tools used primarily for the maintenance of these kinds of websites.
<br /><br /><strong>E-Commerce Maintenance Tools</strong>
<br />One of the most popular tools used by web experts in maintaining a website is the use of WCMS or Web Content Management Systems. The advantage of using a WCMS is that it allows non-technical personnel to make necessary changes within their website without having to ask for assistance from professional web developers or designers.
<br /><br />WCMS applications have become very popular in web development. However, using a WCMS application to maintain an ecommerce website is not viable, possible, but not viable.
<br /><br />However, there is a similar web application that can also be used for the same purpose in that WCMS is used for. This is the ecommerce and online store-management software. And according to many <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9tYWdlbnRvLWUtY29tbWVyY2Utd2ViLWRldmVsb3Blcg__" target="_blank">ecommerce web designer</a></strong> and developer, it works the same way in which WCMS is used, but with more functionality.
<br /><br />Unlike the use of WCMS, an ecommerce and online store-management system can be used not only to make changes in the website’s content or images, but also to make changes on the items sold in the website, such as its details. This system also allows website owners to add new items to the list, or delete items.

It is an Internet Marketing technique which makes use of a number of social media outlets and communities to generate publicity to increase the awareness of a product, brand or event. Part of what made it successful was because of the use of one of its most effective methods. This is the use of Facebook Marketing.
<br /><br /><strong>What is Facebook Marketing?</strong>
<br />Facebook Marketing is a popular Internet Marketing technique that many web marketers are using today. It involves the use of different Facebook marketing techniques which aims to increase a web business’ exposure in the World Wide Web.
<br /><br /><strong>The Idea behind Facebook Marketing</strong>
<br />The reason why Facebook became popularly used for web marketing, particularly in SMO, is because of the amount of traffic that Facebook generates in a day. According to statistics, Facebook generates the largest traffic in the World Wide Web, rivaling that of Google.
<br /><br />Because of this, Facebook became a potential medium for Internet marketing. Eventually, a number of businesses have used Facebook to market their business in the World Wide Web market. One technique that they used was to make a profile page of their business, then invite friends and other people in Facebook through several connections from their existing friends.
<br /><br />From this, businesses will be able to make several marketing skits to attract people into their service or product. Many have also used the exposure of tagging people in a marketing image.
<br /><br />Other than in marketing, the use of Facebook pages also allows businesses to interact with their existing customers and clients so as to receive comments and feedbacks regarding their business.
<br /><br /><strong>Other Popular Techniques used in Facebook Marketing</strong>
<br />Eventually, Facebook had integrated a profile page specifically for businesses which offers more features than a simple Facebook profile page.
<br /><br />But other than the use of Facebook Pages, there is also the use of Facebook Ads and Facebook Apps, in which many <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9mYWNlYm9vay1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1kZXZlbG9wZXI_" target="_blank">Facebook applications developers</a></strong> now offers as a separate service from SMO.
<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Ads</strong>
<br />Facebook Ads is a popular method used in Facebook Marketing which ensure businesses that they are able to target the people interested in their service or product. It works the same way that Google Adwords work.
<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Applications or Apps</strong>
<br />One of the most recent techniques used in Facebook Marketing is the use of Facebook Apps. Facebook Apps is usually more appropriate for starting a promotional campaign. The use of Facebook Apps allows businesses to track the success of their campaign, unlike the use of Facebook’s “Liking” system. In addition to that, Facebook Apps are far easier to share.
<br /><br />Because of this, the demand for professional wordpress developer had continuously grown, particularly now that Facebook is still considered as one of the best Internet Marketing technique in the market.

However, like any other types of Internet Marketing techniques, SEO is also known for its use of illicit techniques which causes adverse effects to a search engine’s SERPs or Search Engine Result Pages.
<br /><br /><strong>The Good and Bad Techniques of SEO</strong>
<br />Similar to most types of Internet Marketing techniques, the use of SEO have also produced a number of adverse effects to the SERPs of a search engine, such as in Google. Techniques which produce such results are known as Black Hat SEO.
<br /><br />According to many experts, including those that offers some of the best seo services Philippines, Black Hat SEO are techniques used in SEO which aims to produce faster results compared to the use of legit and acceptable SEO techniques, known as White Hat SEO.
<br /><br /><strong>White Hat SEO</strong> tends to take longer compared to the use of Black Hat SEO. This is because it uses the natural growth of a website’s authority by sharing information useful for their target market. This in turn will turn into leads, allowing websites to gain more authority in its own market, which also increases its relevance and popularity for search engines in a specific search query pertaining to their service and products.
<br /><br /><strong>Black Hat SEO</strong>, on the other hand, attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines, or involve deception. One black hat technique uses text that is hidden, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible div, or positioned off screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as cloaking. 
<br /><br /><strong>Grey Hat SEO</strong>
<br />Grey Hat SEO, on the other hand, are techniques used in SEO which is either White Hat, because it uses techniques which aims to manipulate search engines, or a Black Hat Technique, in which Grey Hat SEO is not as extreme compared to most types of Black Hat SEO. According to many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9zZW8tcGhpbGlwcGluZXM_" target="_blank">seo Philippines</a>experts, this techniques use subtlety compared to the brute force techniques used in Black Hat SEO.

Facebook, other than a popular socialization media in the World Wide Web, is also known as one of today’s most popular and in-demand web marketing medium. 
<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Marketing</strong>
<br />Facebook marketing is a popular method in web marketing which involves the use of Facebook. It is part of a larger web marketing technique called SMO or Social Media Optimization which aims to use social media websites as a means for marketing a business.
<br /><br />However, because of the many techniques used in Facebook marketing, many web experts have started to offer it as a separate service.

<br /><br /><strong>Different Popular Facebook Marketing Techniques</strong>
<br />There are many popular techniques used in Facebook Marketing other than just Facebook Applications. Here are some of those: 
<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Pages</strong>
<br />One of the first methods that web marketers used in Facebook Marketing is by simply creating their business’ Facebook profile.

<br /><br />Not only did they have a way for showcasing their services or products, the use of Facebook pages also allowed them to market their business freely in Facebook. One method of doing this was to add people to their page then market their business to those that agreed.

<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Ads</strong>
<br />In addition to the use of Facebook Pages, another popular technique used in Facebook Marketing is using Facebook’s own Ads. It is similar to the use of Google Adwords in which Facebook can accurately pinpoint those that may have interest in a business’ products or services by taking note of the user’s interests, as well as the kinds of activities happening in their wall.
<br /><br /><strong>Facebook Applications or Apps</strong>
<br />One of the most recent techniques used in Facebook Marketing is the use of Facebook Apps. The advantage of using Facebook Apps is that the opportunities are endless, as long as Facebook allows the creation of third-party applications that users may freely use.
<br /><br />One way of using Facebook Apps is by making a Facebook game which aims to market a business’ service and product. But one of today’s most popular uses of Facebook Apps that many expert <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9mYWNlYm9vay1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1kZXZlbG9wZXI_" target="_blank">Facebook applications developers</a></strong> have made is with promotions.
<br /><br />It’s functions are similar to Facebook’s tagging system, but is much easier to add people as well as share to anybody interested in the promotion.

And there are many reasons why many had preferred the use of PHP rather than the use of other types of server-side scripting languages, such as Microsoft’s ASP. These reasons include the PHP accelerator.
<br /><br />What is a PHP Accelerator?
<br />A PHP accelerator is a PHP extension designed to improve the performance of software applications written in the PHP programming language.
<br /><br />According to many php developers experts, most PHP accelerators work by caching the compiled bytecode of PHP scripts to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling source code on each request (some or even most of which may never be executed). To further improve performance, the cached code is stored in shared memory and directly executed from there, minimizing the amount of slow disk reads and memory copying at runtime.
<br /><br />Advantages PHP accelerators can substantially increase the speed of PHP applications. Improvements of web page generation throughput by factors of 2 to 7 have been observed.
<br /><br />The effect on application performance of opcode caching varies widely, depending on factors such as the inherent execution time of the PHP application and the percentage of source code actually executed on a given request, and whether additional optimization steps are performed.
<br /><br />According to many <strong><em><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS93ZWItZGVzaWduLXNlcnZpY2VzLXBoaWxpcHBpbmVzLw__" target="_blank">web developer Philippines</a></em></strong> experts, while a code optimizer may even slow down overall performance when used in isolation, it can provide an additional performance boost when coupled with a bytecode cache, as the optimization effort is performed just once.

<br />Increase your website’s visibility through Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Media Optimization (SMO)
<br />Every day, 30,000 new websites are launched on the Internet, each one competing for the attention of a rapidly expanding, notoriously fickle Internet surfing population. The overwhelming majority of Internet users go online for three major activities: get information, purchase products or services, and interact with other Internet users. The company that does not find ways to help these consumers achieve their goals will be left behind by the global revolution.
<br /><br />Take a moment to try the following exercise:
<br /><br />Perform a keyword search: enter a term specific to your business (this can be your product or your service).
<br />    Does your business appear at the top of the results?
<br />    If not, scroll down (beneath your competitors) until you find your business.
<br />    Don’t be disappointed – we can bring you up to the top spot.
<br /><br />Bring in more people who are already looking for you and turn them into satisfied customers
<br />One of the most frustrating experiences of Internet users happens when they try to search for your company and cannot find you.

It is also considered as one of the cheapest, yet one of the most powerful Internet Marketing technique used in the industry.
<br /><br />Strengths of SEO
<br />According to many experts, SEO is considered as one of the most successful and powerful Internet Marketing technique. Part of the reason why is because of its effectiveness in increasing a website’s traffic through search engines, particularly among major search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.
<br />Because search engines are highly visited and used tool for surfing the Internet, many online marketers used this as their main market to increase their business’ success in the World Wide Web. This is when SEM or Search Engine Marketing was first developed.
<br /><br />Before SEO, there where other popular SEM techniques used in the market, usually involving paid placements such as the popular PPC (Pay-Per-Click), contextual advertising, and even a paid inclusion which involves paying a search engine company to include their website in a specific keyword.
<br /><br />Eventually, SEO was introduced in the market. Although similar in their target, SEO and SEM are different Internet Marketing techniques. The first difference is that SEM uses paid inclusion while SEO makes use of several techniques which aims to improve or “optimize” a website to achieve higher ranking in search results via the process of selecting specific keyword expressions associated to the website. And compared to SEM, SEO is usually free of charge (although hiring an SEO company is usually very expensive).

But what effects can this do to SEO practices?
<br /><br />Most SEO specialists and experts around the world focuses mainly on the algorithm of Google. This is due to the fact that Google has a total market share of 91% (based on the study made in 2010) compared to other major search engines in the market such as Yahoo! and Bing. This is the reason why most techniques used by SEO specialists and experts deals with increasing their website’s relevance in Google’s SERPs or search engine result pages.
<br /><br />Because of this, Google had continuously made several changes in their algorithm due to the many deceptive SEO techniques used by many webmasters. And recently, Google had announced a major change in it’s algorithm, affecting 11.8% of its previous algorithm, to combat the growing concern about duplicate contents, content farming, as well as “dead” websites.
<br /><br />Details about Google’s Major Algorithm Change
<br />According to the announcement made by Google, this major update aims to reduce rankings of low quality websites, websites which are normally of no use for users (but useful for SEO specialists), as well as those websites with duplicate contents such as article sites and a few press releases. This, however, does bode well for many SEO specialists that strongly follows the search engine guidelines.
<br /><br />According to many <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9zZW8tcGhpbGlwcGluZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><strong>seo philippines</strong></a> experts, this new algorithm also aims to further improve the rankings of high-quality websites, which are websites that offer fresh and unique contents based on information that will pose very useful for Google’s users.
<br /><br />What Changes will this make in SEO?
<br />According to many SEO Philippines experts, there have been a number of major changes within the usual process of SEO. Many SEO specialists and experts have said that since the major change, many of their websites, which mostly runs in black hat SEO techniques, had significantly dropped due to the fact that most of their links were made irrelevant in Google’s new algorithm.
<br /><br />However, many websites, particularly with those that generates unique and fresh contents every day such as blogs, have significantly risen in Google’s SERPs due to this new change in algorithm. Because of this, many SEO experts have said that the best way to rank higher in today’s algorithm is by branding through unique and high-quality contents.
<br /><br />Many seo philippines experts have also said that link building still a very effective way in SEO, though they may have to change their ways to improve their links such as not linking to duplicate contents and producing unique and fresh content for the use of people.

One method is through submitting one's website, another is through on-page factors including cross-linking, keyword rich contents, URL optimization, and meta tags.
<br /><br />Getting indexed is one of the many main purposes of SEO or search engine optimization. After a website is developed and uploaded on the internet, making it available for use of public users, internet marketing techniques are then employed to make their website more visible on the internet. One of the most popular techniques used is SEO, or search engine optimization.
<br /><br />There are many methods employed in an SEO campaign. One of the most important is techniques used on how a website could get indexed. One way is through submitting one's website to different web directories. According to SEO Philippines consultants, examples of web directories are these two major directories, the Yahoo Directory and the Open Directory Project in which both require manual submission and human editorial review.
<br /><br />However, some search engines, notably Yahoo!, operate a paid submission service that guarantee crawling for either a set fee or cost per click. Such programs usually guarantee inclusion in the database, but do not guarantee specific ranking within the search results. Google, on the other hand, offers Google Webmaster Tools, for which an XML Sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that aren't discoverable by automatically following links.
<br /><br />Other than submitting one's website or XML sitemap to a web directories, other methods are also used to increase a website's visibility in the web through optimizing on-page factors such as inside linking and code optimization. According to <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9zZW8tcGhpbGlwcGluZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><strong>seo philippines</strong></a> consultants, these other methods are more popularly known in the market as On-Page SEO. On-page SEO techniques include:
<br /><br />·         Cross-linking or inside linking - This technique involves placing links that points inside the website, or cross linking between pages of the same website. Giving more links to main pages of the website, to increase PageRank used by search engines.
<br /><br />·         Keyword rich contents - Content is very important in SEO. Keyword rich text in the webpage and key phrases, so as to match all search queries. HTML codes such as Alt Tags and Title Tags are also used to contain several keywords.
<br /><br />·         URL optimization - Optimizing the website's URL is also important by containing several keywords.
<br /><br />·         Meta Tags - These are also popular mainly because of its importance in search engine crawlers. However, according to SEO Philippines consultants, its importance in SEO have reduced recently due to search engine taking of its weight in ranking.

And that its techniques and methods involve a lot a of dedication as well as expertise in world of Internet marketing and technical issues pertaining to website design.
<br /><br />SEO or search engine optimization is one of the top methods used in Internet marketing today. What made it popular is because of its &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; methods to get users to visit a website via search engines, particularly with Google, Yahoo!, and many other popular search engines. Unlike SEM or search engine marketing, which uses paid inclusion, SEO involves the use of techniques which improves the quality of traffic to a website through natural or unpaid inclusion. 
<br /><br />However, many find that SEO is much more complicated than other methods of Internet marketing. And that its techniques and methods involve a lot a of dedication as well as expertise in world of Internet marketing and technical issues pertaining to website design. So what are the usual things that goes through SEO? 
<br /><br />Technical aspects of SEO
<br />SEO involves techniques which makes use of both the website itself as well as external factors which are used to further improve a website's visibility as well as quality of traffic coming from search engines. Factors used in the website are typically known in the industry as on-page SEO while the external factors are known as off-page SEO. The main objective of on-page SEO is about making a website more &amp;quot;search engine friendly&amp;quot; while off-page SEO is more about improving a website's traffic in search engines or in other popular social networking sites.
<br /><br />On-page SEO
<br />On-page SEO involves the use of techniques which is directed to make a website more search engine friendly. Before an SEO campaign starts, SEO specialists or consultants would usually inspect a website if its search engine friendly or not. They would usually commence with the off-page SEO if the website is friendly enough, but if not, several changes would be done within a website, usually through its content and codes. 
<br /><br />The reason why on-page SEO is very important is because search engines, such as Google, makes use of crawlers or search engine spiders to crawl through a website's content as well as codes and fetch important information that users may eventually search for. By improving one's content as well as its codes, it would increase the chance of that website getting indexed. 
<br /><br />This part of SEO may involves technical skills in markup languages. This is the reason why many SEO consultants may ask assistance from a web specialist, such as a designer or a developer. However, because of CMS or content management systems, this practice became a lot more easier. 
<br /><br />Off-page SEO
<br />Here is the bulk of every SEO campaigns. Although the on-page factors are important, its use can only go as far as making their site relevant to specific queries or searches. Off-page factors, however, improves the quality of traffic to a website through the use of many methods. One popular method used in off-page SEO is link building. 
<br /><br />Link building is considered in the market as one of the oldest, yet still one of the most powerful technique used in SEO. According to many professionals, such as those from <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9zZW8tcGhpbGlwcGluZXMuaHRtbA__" target="_blank"><strong>seo philippines</strong></a> specialists, link building is just a term used to define a family of techniques used in SEO. Popular techniques in link building includes one-way links and three-way linking. 
<br /><br />One-way linking in SEO
<br />One-way linking is a technique used in off-page SEO which is considered as the standard in any SEO campaigns. Although not considered as the first technique used in SEO, one-way linking is known for its effectiveness in SEO. According to many SEO Philippines specialists, this type of link building is considered more natural in the eyes of search engines compared to its predecessor. Popular techniques of one-way linking includes blog comments, forum posting, as well as link bait, the latter being the most powerful. 
<br /><br />Three-way linking is a method which were influenced by the first technique used in SEO link building, the reciprocal linking. However, according to experts, Three-way linking creates more &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; links in the eyes of search engines. The value of links by three-way linking can then be better than normal reciprocal links, which are usually done between two domains.
<br /><br />Illicit use
<br />Like many other Internet marketing techniques, SEO is also known for its illegal methods. These methods are called black hat SEO, which is distinct to another popular SEO term the white hat SEO. According to many professionals such as those from seo Philippines companies, black hat SEO tends to produce a much faster results than white hat. However, websites using black hat SEO techniques is punishable by search engines, such as banning a website from their indexes, if caught.

But as it grew, the Internet has expanded from the academic and research world into a media used for a wide sets of purposes including marketing and advertising. The need for the improvement of the visual appearances of website also became apparent. Web designers have sought ways to improve the layout of web pages presented to the end users. One way of organizing and controlling every element found in a websites is through the use of tables and spacers.
<br /><br />The use of tables became popular in web page designing, but also posed several problems. Because of web pages designed with tables nested inside another table have, HTML files became larger which in turn use more bandwidth than documents with simpler formatting. Furthermore, when a table based layout is linearized, for example when being parsed by a screen reader or a search engine, the resulting order of the content can be somewhat jumbled and confusing. Visit a web designers Philippines site to learn more about tableless web designs.
<br /><br />Editors such as the popular Macromedia Dreamweaver (now Adobe Dreamweaver) that arrived in the 1990s have provided a more convenient and easier way for web designers to design a web page layout. Such editors indirectly encourage extensive use of nested tables to position design elements. As designers edit their documents in these editors, code is added to the document which is sometimes unnecessary. Furthermore, unskilled designers may use tables more than required when using a WYSIWYG editor.
<br /><br />As the dotcom boom receded in 2001 and the Web development industry shrank, coders with more industry experience were in higher demand. In a large number of cases UI development was carried out by coders with greater knowledge of good coding practice. It was around this time that many became critical of messy coding practices and the idea of tableless design began to grow.
<br /><br />Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were developed to improve the separation between design and content, and move back towards a semantic organization of content on the Web. The term &quot;tableless design implies the use of CSS to position HTML elements on the page but it should be noted that tables and CSS are not mutually exclusive. Many experienced HTML coders use CSS to manipulate tables frequently. Learn more about CSS by visiting a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS93ZWItZGVzaWduLXNlcnZpY2VzLw__" target="_blank">web designers Philippines</a></strong> site.
<br /><br />Advantages of Tableless Websites
<br />There are 3 main advantages why a tableless web design is much more user-efficient than the typical use of tables. These advantages are Accessibility, Bandwidth Efficient, and Maintainability.
<br /><br />Accessibility
<br />As a result of the separation of design (CSS) and structure (HTML), it is also possible to provide different layouts for different devices, e.g. handhelds, mobile phones, etc. It is also possible to specify a different style sheet for print, e.g. to hide or modify the appearance of advertisements or navigation elements that are irrelevant and a nuisance in the printable version of the page.
<br /><br />Bandwidth Efficient
<br />Using external style sheets to position page elements means more mark up language may be cached and further reduce download times for subsequent pages using the same resources. Poor implementation of tableless design can result in many more lines of code used per page element which can increase download time. Tables have a defined set of rules which are clear and concise while tableless design often involves working around browser inconsistencies.
<br /><br />Maintainability
<br />In tableless layout using CSS, virtually all of the layout information resides in one place: the CSS document. Because the layout information is centralized, these changes can be made quickly and globally by default. The HTML files themselves do not, usually, need to be adjusted when making layout changes. If they do, it is usually to add class-tags to specific markup elements or to change the grouping of various sections with respect to one another. For more information about Tableless web designs, its uses and its effective, then visit an online <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS93ZWItZGVzaWduLXNlcnZpY2VzLw__" target="_blank">web designers Philippines</a></strong> site to learn more.

This is because of the simplicity of the business while allowing these kinds of businesses to target a larger market. However, creating an e-Commerce website is not as simple as any website.
<br /><br />The reason why e-Commerce website is complicated is because of the number of background processing that it requires. As an online shopping center, an e-Commerce website is expected to take orders from customers, process this order, and then send order reports to its administrator or owner. It was also because of this process that the popular “shopping cart” program was created to simplify the order process for both the developer and its customers. 
<br /><br />However, there are also other applications which were developed to further simplify the creation of e-Commerce websites. This is when Magento was created and introduced for market use.
<br /><br />What is Magento? <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9tYWdlbnRvLWUtY29tbWVyY2Utd2ViLWRldmVsb3Blcg__" target="_blank">Magento</a></strong> is an open source ecommerce web application which enables the creation of e-Commerce website with minimal experience in web development and programming which was launched on March 31, 2008.
<br /><br />It was developed by Varien, now Magento Inc., with the help from the programmers within the open source community but is owned solely by Magento Inc.
<br /><br />Similar to a blog, Magento allows its users to have complete control over the look, content, and functionality of their e-Commerce website. Because of this, merchants with little experience in web development can easily start their online business with Magento. And the best about this application is that there is a free version of this called the Magento Community Edition.
<br /><br />Need for Magento Developer However, not all merchants are knowledgeable with the use of Magento, and unlike a Blog, it may still require more than basic knowledge of web development. This is the reason why magento developer became in-demand all over the world, including in the Philippines.
<br /><br />Why Use <strong>Magento</strong>? But why not hire a full web development team to create and maintain an e-Commerce website rather than to hire a <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9tYWdlbnRvLWUtY29tbWVyY2Utd2ViLWRldmVsb3Blcg__" target="_blank">magento developer</a></strong> to use Magento? The advantage of using Magento is that this application allows for easier editing of their e-Commerce website without having to hire one or more web developer in Philippines to maintain their website.
<br /><br />Once the e-Commerce website has been complete, a Magento developer will teach the website’s owner on how to use Magento in editing the appearance of their website as they please. This saves them more expense from hiring a web developer to maintain their website.

<br /><br />However, its effectiveness it’s usually limited to only increasing a website’s visitor, and not the website’s conversion rate. This is the reason why SEO is usually offered with a redesign of a website so as to fully utilize SEO’s effectiveness in web marketing.
<br /><br />On-Page SEO Optimization On-Page SEO Optimization, or on-page optimization, is a process in SEO which deals with the improvement of the website to make it more “search engine friendly.” This is by increasing the website’s keyword density.

<br /><br />In addition to those, the Alt Tags and Title Tags are also popular places where SEO experts can increase a website’s keyword density, as well as with its URL and links. On-Page SEO also involves changing an image’s file name.
<br /><br />But other than on the website’s coding, on-page SEO also involves changing the website’s content. Not only does this improve the website’s keyword density, but also improves the website’s authority in the World Wide Web by sharing information that can be useful for many people. This is also used in a popular SEO technique called link bait.

<br /><br />Although this was the time in which Tables were used as means for controlling the elements found in a website, did you know that style sheet languages were first proposed as a tool to manipulate the design of the website.
<br /><br />According to many web experts from different <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS93ZWItZGVzaWduLXNlcnZpY2VzLw__" target="_blank">website development Manila</a></strong>, CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to improve web accessibility and to make HTML code semantic rather than presentational. Around the same time, in the late 1990s, as the dot-com boom led to a rapid growth in the 'new media' of web page creation and design, there began a trend of using HTML tables, and their rows, columns and cells, to control the layout of whole web pages.

So what is link building and what made it an important part in any SEO campaign?
<br /><strong>
<br />What is Link Building?</strong>
<br />Link building, coming from the name itself, is method popularly used in SEO which aims to increase a website’s quantity and quality of back-links. The reason why this technique became popular is because search engines, particularly Google, weighs a website’s by the number of quality and quantity of back-links, like a vote to a running candidate.
<br /><br />And ever since the start of SEO, link building had continuously evolved to accommodate the many changes on search engine’s algorithm.
<br /><br /><strong>Different Link Building Techniques</strong>
<br />One of the most popular links building techniques used in the past was reciprocal or two-way linking. It is one of the few link building services in the past that aims to increase a website’s quantity of links by exchanging links from other websites. This technique also gave birth to the two-way and three-way linking.
<br /><br />Eventually, a new and more effective technique was developed, the one-way linking. It is a technique that involves creating one-way links from other websites without having to reciprocate it. This is one of the most popular techniques used even today, and from that method, it inspired a number of different techniques on how to gain one-way links from different websites. Here are some of those:
<br /><br /><strong>Blog Comments</strong>
<br />One of the many popular techniques used to produce one-way links is by commenting a blog. Although this technique has become ineffective for many reasons, it was one of the most popular techniques used by many SEO companies, particularly those that offer <strong><a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5teW9wdGltaW5kLmNvbS9hZmZvcmRhYmxlLXNlby1zZXJ2aWNlcy8_" target="_blank">affordable seo services</a></strong>.
<br /><br /><strong>Forum Posting</strong>
<br />This technique requires patience, but very rewarding. Although it was used alongside the time that blogs were used in link building, the effort that a link builder must put in this technique is too much unlike the use of blog comments. Today, however, forum posting had again become a very popular link building technique.
<br /><br /><strong>Article Marketing and Press Releases</strong>
<br />Both are still popular techniques, however, because of Google’s sensitivity in duplicate content, this technique may not offer the same kind of benefit that it had in the past. Press Releases, however, are still popular in SEO.
<br /><br /><strong>Blogging</strong>
<br />One of today’s most popular and effective SEO link building techniques is blogging. Not only does this offer unique content but also offers a way for link builders to create one-way links that can truly attract their target market.(Source)
