The introduction of the Internet to our daily lives not only has kept friends and family connected but also has allowed everyone to expand horizons and be curious about other cultures from all over the globe. The Earth has truly become one small world. This confluence of factors has led to the ever-growing trend for cross-cultural appreciation by the mass at large. And it will not go away.

ZeMis’ narrower but more specialized anthology of designer accessories for this season entitled ‘Elements of Nature’ is a throw back to the ancient times when philosophers, astrologers and astronomers were indistinguishable. The second in the series – Un Earthed, features natural gemstones such as carnelian, agate and jasper interwoven with Swarovski crystals and glass beads.
<br /><br />August 19, 2010 – ZeMis, the lifestyle accessories boutique, is pleased to launch the Earth series called simply <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3ODM0NDEvMS9FYXJ0aC5odG0_" target="_blank">Un Earthed</a>  as the second of its <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3MzgxNjEvMS9GYWxsLVdpbnRlci1Db2xsZWN0aW9uLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">Elements of Nature</a>  collection for Fall-Winter 2010-2011. The highly unique designer accessories capture both forward exoticism and mystical charm. Made from semi-precious gemstones and Swarovski crystals, the Earth-friendly collection of statement neckpieces sizzles fervently despite a very cold season.

<br /><br />This season, ZeMis remains true to form to its Mother Nature and artisan craft advocacy. The <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3ODM0NDEvMS9FYXJ0aC5odG0_" target="_blank">Earth series</a>  tells a glamorous story of rough and polished characters blending together at the seams literally.

And winter spells holiday season – that time of year where we all must get involved in chaotic shopping. But do we really need to rush year after year when we pretty much give to the same people plus minus a few? Why not start early and don’t forget to give a gift for yourself. You deserve it anyway for thinking of shopping for your loved ones. To start with, ZeMis is offering a whopping 70% OFF discount on its handmade designer accessories starting next week. 
<br /><br />September 9, 2010 – ZeMis, the lifestyle accessories global boutique, is aggressively offering a 70% discount off the list price of its best selling items and newest accessory line up for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3MzgxNjEvMS9GYWxsLVdpbnRlci1Db2xsZWN0aW9uLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">Fall-Winter 2010-2011</a>  . The online store is starting early to entice early bird shoppers to browse through its products for the upcoming holiday shopping season. The 70 OFF promo applies to its in-house <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMjk0ODY0MjM4MjEvMS9DbGFzc2ljLUNvbGxlY3Rpb24uaHRt" target="_blank">handmade designer accessories</a>   line featuring natural stones, pearls and crystals meshed together as dazzling neckpieces and avant garde costume jewelry.

<br /><br />Season after season, ZeMis comes up with a design theme that encompasses its line of designer accessories. Last Spring 2010, ZeMis produced a well-acclaimed line of neckpieces and bracelets woven under the theme &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; featuring both natural and manmade wonders such as <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMzg2NjY4MjQ2ODEvMS9QeXJhbWlkLW9mLUdpemEuaHRt" target="_blank">The Pyramid of Giza</a>  , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMzg2NjY4NjA4ODEvMS9BY3JvcG9saXMuaHRt" target="_blank">The Acropolis</a>  , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMzg2NjY4ODY0NDEvMS9NYWNodS1QaWNjaHUuaHRt" target="_blank">Machu Picchu</a>   and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMzg2NjY5NzU3MjEvMS9HcmVhdC1CYXJyaWVyLVJlZWYuaHRt" target="_blank">The Great Barrier Reef</a>  . For this Fall-Winter 2011 season, ZeMis worked around the Elements of Nature and designed neckpieces around <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3ODM0NDEvMS9FYXJ0aC5odG0_" target="_blank">Earth</a>  , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvNTU5MzQ3NzU0MDEvMS9XYXRlci5odG0_" target="_blank">Water</a>  , Metal and Wood theme as opposed to the standard Earth, Air, Fire and Water elements. Each resulting neckpiece is a unique work of art that can be passed on as an heirloom piece for generations forward, yet still provides that edgy elegance for today's youth.
<br /><br />ZeMis differentiates its products from other online stores selling <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMjkyNTAxNjY5MDEvMS9KZXdlbHJ5Lmh0bQ__" target="_blank">jewelry</a>   and <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMjk0ODY0MjM4MjEvMS9DbGFzc2ljLUNvbGxlY3Rpb24uaHRt" target="_blank">fashion accessories</a>   by presenting detailed product pictures with various angles and sketch diagrams showing relevant dimensions to give customers comprehensive information as well as delight, convenience and a seamless transaction experience.

		<document id="6335cec14748e945d5cb43bd3df6731a" url=""><![CDATA[Be a Savvy Online Shopper Because It’s the Best Way to Sho<br/><br/>Year after year, statistics come out about how online retail is booming and that more and more people are shopping online. It’s true. At the end of the day, you get to compare prices, download comprehensive product information all from the comforts of home, office, school or coffee shop. No fighting for the parking spot, wiggling through the mall crowd, toiling through traffic or haggling with a fast-mouthed seller.  Just when other retailers are enticing customers with back-to-school items, ZeMis is getting a head start by dangling a 70% discount to lure visitors to shop early or at least ‘window shop’ to see what possible gifts are available to give away to family and friends. But is this enough reason for anyone to shop at ZeMis?
<br /><br />September 16, 2010 – Our store ZeMis (<a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zemis.com"target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.zemis.com</a>) is popularly known as Mother Nature’s boutique because of its breadth of product offerings in eco-friendly accessories and handmade natural products. We recently launched our 70 OFF Fire Sale Promo which will run until September 23, 2010 Pacific Time. As an earth-friendly online store, we offer <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9HcmVlbl9UaXBzXy1fSG9tZS5odG0_" target="_blank">green tips for the home</a>  , <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9HcmVlbl9UaXBzXy1fT2ZmaWNlLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">office</a>   and during <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9HcmVlbl9UaXBzXy1fVHJhdmVsLmh0bQ__" target="_blank">travel</a>  . But this time ZeMis is pleased to offer you online shopping tips to get you or the novice shopper next to you, acquainted with what’s out there in cyber space.
<br /><br />1. <strong>Get to know the site.</strong> Don’t just buy from any site that pops up on the 1st page of a Google search. These sites either have a huge budget for search engine marketing or are run by tech-savvy entrepreneurs. Big budgeted companies are normally more reputable but do take the time to get to know who is actually taking your money. A lot of sites team up with bigger, well-reputed companies to handle their transaction processing such as Amazon or Paypal. This guarantees your money and gives you assurance that you can get it back if products fall short of seller promises.
<br />2. <strong>Take advantage of sales.</strong> Stores like ZeMis.com are offering huge 70% discounts to get you to the first step of online shopping – visit their site. Once you’re on their site, they’re hoping you can check out their other items and perhaps buy it. Maybe not now but their store is now top of your mind. Here’s the tip. If you like what’s on sale, buy it. No need to buy anything else. Chances are they’re losing on the sale in the hopes that you will buy other items where they can earn a profit. That means you’re getting a good deal!
<br />3. <strong>Shop early.</strong> In the same way we avoid rush hour, avoid jam-packed sites inundated with orders on December 22. Whether it’s Christmas, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa, there’s a deadline to meet and why risk overshooting the all-important date? Most sites offer free shipping if you shop early. By all means, maximize this shopping opportunity.
<br />4. <strong>Know their privacy policy and security risk.</strong> Don’t order from a site until you’ve read through their About Us and Privacy Policy pages. Make sure they use encryption technology to process your order and that they will not sell your e-mail address to third parties or use your financial information for other purposes. ZeMis has teamed up with Amazon to handle all of its e-commerce transactions. Your credit card and e-mail information go through Amazon and not ZeMis. It is kept secure and safe from third parties.
<br />5. <strong>Print or save a screenshot of your order page after it has been placed.</strong>  This is your proof of purchase. If anything happens to your purchase along the way, this is your sole proof that details everything about your transaction. Likewise, save the e-mail confirmation that your order was placed and/or was shipped.
<br />6. <strong>Release personal information at a bare minimum.</strong> All web merchants require you to disclose personal information such as billing and ship to addresses. But by all means keep your password private (even or especially from your children) and never divulge your social security number.
<br />7. <strong>Follow your instincts on trust.</strong> Online shopping should be as comfortable and convenient as possible, not stressful. If for any reason, you have doubts about a site, don’t place the order until your concerns have been addressed. Contact the store. If they respond timely and adequately, then maybe they are worth trying. Consider buying a low-ticket item first. If all goes well, you can gradually increase your transaction size.
<br /><br />There are many more tips we can offer but the above are the most basic ones to get you started. The most important first tip of all is to get rid of your anxiety of online shopping. IT IS SAFE. VERY SAFE. People from different walks of life have been doing it for more than a decade, mostly intelligent, highly-educated shoppers. They’re smart because they know the benefits and have been maximizing bargain and convenience opportunities for a long time.
<br /><br />ZeMis specializes in <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMjk0ODY0MjM4MjEvMS9DbGFzc2ljLUNvbGxlY3Rpb24uaHRt" target="_blank">handmade natural designer accessories</a>  .

Disneyland continually churns new rides and amusement parks where child population is exploding. But the one ride that Disneyland will always showcase in each of its theme parks is the 'It's a Small World' boat ride. It is the hallmark of what makes Disneyland 'the best place on Earth'. Theme park visitors, be it child or child at heart, get an introductory view of cultures across continents. There’s music from around the world; ethnic dolls dancing to foreign language version of 'It's a Small World' in colorful global costumes. Indeed, you sail around the world in 8 minutes or less.
<br /><br />ZeMis does not aim to replicate the ride offerings in its online store but the romantic sentiments and ultimate goals are the same – cultural understanding and appreciation for cultural diversity. To do this, knowledge of other cultures should be introduced to kids as early as possible and in a fun, exciting way.

It's a movement that's made significant strides in educating the public about reducing carbon footprint and slowing the pace of global warming. This fact could not be more apparent as it takes center stage in every forum where global leaders discuss the most pressing political, economic and social issues.
<br /><br />Some of us may argue that we cannot prevent global warming since the Earth is really headed towards that direction. However, we cannot deny that human intervention has accelerated the pace. Green gases trapped in our atmosphere increase at an alarming rate. What are we to do? It starts with baby steps to finally leap forward. Why not start with trying green products yourself and sharing these nature made items to loved ones. Natural, handmade accessories come in all forms, sizes and price points at ZeMis. They make perfect green gifts - in time for the upcoming Christmas holiday.

The birth of Jesus is the main reason behind holiday gift giving and December 25 has always been the deadline to beat to purchase and check off the last name on the gift list. While Christmas has become a commercial holiday, the miracle of Jesus’ birth still reverberates throughout the Christian world. Outside this world, we also celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. Just like Christmas, these holidays rekindle feelings of hope and thanksgiving. All three bring a singular message of giving glory to God for the various miracles and blessings – birth of a Savior (Christmas), extending the flame’s light (Hanukkah) and bountiful harvest (Kwanzaa). In line with ZeMis’ philosophy of celebrating all cultures and traditions, we bring you a fresh line of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa gifts to help educate children and adults alike about these two beautiful holidays in December.

From Kwanzaa dolls and craft books to Menorah candles and Dreidel puzzles, ZeMis provides a fresh offering of Kwanzaa and Hanukkah products to celebrate the Jewish (Hanukkah) and Afro-American (Kwanzaa) traditions and make these annual feasts known to various cultures. <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vc2VhcmNoLmh0bT9rZXl3b3JkPWt3YW56YWE_" target="_blank">Kwanzaa</a> is celebrated every year from December 26 to January 2 while <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vc2VhcmNoLmh0bT9rZXl3b3JkPWhhbnVra2Fo" target="_blank">Hannukah</a>  begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev which is based on the lunar cycle.

Let's not make it a task we want to procrastinate on. After all, is that what the holiday has come down to - a big headache of a chore? Let us rekindle feelings of warmth and sharing joy and love within us. Let’s refresh our memories when we would stay up for Santa to come down, wait under the mistletoe to kiss our crush or eat cookies with warm milk and down the eggnog to the last drop. Let images of our childhood home, old friends and family spring to life. The urge to reconnect with loved ones and to wish them well continue to be reinforced during this time of year. In the end, the cliché rings true to this day – we want peace and goodwill to all men.

Time to Reconnect<br/><br/>It’s that time of year in the USA when airfare is at its peak and road traffic reaches rage levels. Some dread the advent of the most important long weekend of the year not just due to the impending traffic but worse, having to present to Mom and Dad a report card of where they are with their love life and career. For most homemakers, the pressure of coming up with the juiciest, most tender turkey brings them so much tension that they secretly or unknowingly crave for. Yet there are those, fathers and young children especially, who just look forward to rejoicing with the entire family. Whatever anxieties we may feel towards the Thanksgiving weekend, it’s the one event of the year we know we must celebrate and face – for our own good.
<br /><br />Thanksgiving is a tradition that every American family celebrates to give thanks for all blessings that have come their way. Historically, the Thanksgiving offering was a religious observation to give thanks to God as the Pilgrims from Plymouth Rock survived their first harsh winter in New England. This commemoration has become an annual tradition since 1863 and a feast in a crowded dining room is a common image depicting the American ritual. Indeed, Thanksgiving is about coming home to family so we can reconfirm our roles as parent or child, re-establish ties with long lost relatives, rejuvenate internally by stepping away from the urban jungle for a weekend and simply reconnecting with our own past memories to hopefully achieve a healthier sense of self. 
<br /><br />Thanksgiving has also spurred commercial traditions, specifically Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving which is busiest shopping day of the year and more recently, Cyber Monday, the busiest online shopping day of the year. On this end, ZeMis has prepared a 50% OFF promotion to entice buyers as Thanksgiving officially kicks off the Christmas shopping season.
<br /><br />November 25, 2010 /ZEMIS LTD – ZeMis, the lifestyle accessories boutique showcasing avante garde odds and ends brings you an endless flow of great bargains for <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvMzQyODc3NDYyNDEvMS9CbGFjay1GcmlkYXktRGVhbHMuaHRt" target="_blank">Thanksgiving shopping</a> in time for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

We are confident of continuous high growth this year and so we are pushing forward with more aggressive marketing all around.” <a href="http://en.pan.netcom/go/out/url=-aHR0cDovL3d3dy56ZW1pcy5jb20_" target="_blank">ZeMis</a> launched its online store in September 2009 and has experienced steady growth in sales and market recognition since, despite the economic woes.

We know where we want to go and we have a clear idea on how to implement our plans. The economic slowdown allowed us to learn the ropes without sacrificing customer satisfaction.”
