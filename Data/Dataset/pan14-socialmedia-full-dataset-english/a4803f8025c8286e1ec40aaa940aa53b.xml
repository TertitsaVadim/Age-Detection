<br />Some tears never dry
<br /><br />I used to think that we could work it out
<br />I used to think that if we
<br />had some problems
<br />I always thought if there was love around
<br />No matter what, I always
<br />thought we'll solve it
<br /><br />Now everyday we're in an argument
<br />It's like a circle that don't ever end
<br />We're keeping secrets and
<br />we're telling lies
<br />Whatever's wrong, let's make it right Cause I...
<br /><br />I don't wanna say goodbye
<br />Cause my heart couldn't take it
<br />Baby, give me one more try
<br />I don't wanna have to cry
<br />Cause I know if we lose it
<br />Baby, some tears never dry
<br /><br />Now what happened to our movie nights?
<br />Girl, I thought that we
<br />would always have them
<br />I used to make you laugh like all the time
<br /><br />Now I don't ever, we got a problem
<br /><br />Lately, you never ask about my day
<br />And on the phone we got nothing to say
<br />I get the feeling something's going on
<br />Whatever's wrong, let's make it right Cause I...
<br /><br />I don't wanna say goodbye
<br />Cause my heart couldn't take it
<br />Baby, give me one more try
<br />I don't wanna have to cry
<br />Cause I know if we lose it
<br />Baby, some tears never dry
<br /><br />Let's talk about
<br />A way that we can work it out
<br />Girl, we're running outta time
<br />And the thought of a break up
<br />Is tearing me up inside
<br /><br />We can work it out
<br />If we talk about it
<br />We can show the world
<br />That you and I are fighting for it
<br />We'll get through the worst
<br />And I know we'll make it
<br />If we stay together
<br />We'll make it through alive
<br /><br />I don't wanna say goodbye
<br />Cause my heart couldn't take it
<br />Baby, give me one more try
<br />I don't wanna have to cry
<br />Cause I know if we lose it
<br />Baby, some tears never dry

<br /><br />Let me paint this picture for you, baby
<br /><br />You spend your nights alone
<br />And he never comes home
<br />And every time you call him
<br />All you get's a busy tone
<br />I heard you found out
<br />That he's doing to you
<br />What you did to me
<br />Ain't that the way it goes
<br /><br />When you cheated girl
<br />My heart bleeded girl
<br />So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
<br />Just a classic case
<br />A scenario
<br />Tale as old as time
<br />Girl you got what you deserved
<br /><br />And now you want somebody
<br />To cure the lonely nights
<br />You wish you had somebody
<br />That could come and make it right
<br /><br />But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
<br />You'll see
<br /><br />(What goes around comes back around)
<br />I thought I told ya, hey
<br />(What goes around comes back around)
<br />I thought I told ya, hey
<br />(What goes around comes back around)
<br />I thought I told ya, hey
<br />(What goes around comes back around)
<br />I thought I told ya, hey
<br /><br />[laughs]
<br />See?
<br />You should've listened to me, baby
<br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

<br />Every step I'm taking, 
<br />Every move I make feels
<br />Lost with no direction
<br />My faith is shaking but I
<br />Got to keep trying
<br />Got to keep my head held high
<br /><br />There's always going to be another mountain
<br />I'm always going to want to make it move
<br />Always going to be an uphill battle, 
<br />Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose, 
<br />Ain't about how fast I get there, 
<br />Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
<br />It's the climb
<br /><br />The struggles I'm facing, 
<br />The chances I'm taking
<br />Sometimes they knock me down but
<br />No I'm not breaking
<br />I mean I know it
<br />But these are the moments that
<br />I'm going to remember most yeah
<br />Just got to keep going
<br />And I, 
<br />I got to be strong
<br />Just keep pushing on, 
<br /><br />There's always going to be another mountain
<br />I'm always going to want to make it move
<br />Always going to be an uphill battle, 
<br />Sometimes I'm gonna to have to lose, 
<br />Ain't about how fast I get there, 
<br />Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
<br />It's the climb
<br /><br />There's always going to be another mountain
<br />I'm always going to want to make it move
<br />Always going to be an uphill battle, 
<br />Sometimes you going to have to lose, 
<br />Ain't about how fast I get there, 
<br />Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
<br />It's the climb
<br /><br />Keep on moving
<br />Keep climbing
<br />Keep the faith baby
<br />It's all about
<br />It's all about
<br />The climb
<br />Keep the faith
<br />Keep your faith

<br />Misused, Mistakes
<br />Too long, Too late
<br />Who was I to make you wait
<br />Just one chance
<br />Just one breath
<br />Just in case there's just one left
<br />'Cause you know,
<br />you know, you know
<br /><br />[CHORUS]
<br />That I love you
<br />I have loved you all along
<br />And I miss you
<br />Been far away for far too long
<br />I keep dreaming you'll be with me
<br />and you'll never go
<br />Stop breathing if
<br />I don't see you anymore
<br /><br />On my knees, I'll ask
<br />Last chance for one last dance
<br />'Cause with you, I'd withstand
<br />All of hell to hold your hand
<br />I'd give it all
<br />I'd give for us
<br />Give anything but I won't give up
<br />'Cause you know,
<br />you know, you know
<br /><br />[CHORUS]
<br /><br />So far away
<br />Been far away for far too long
<br />So far away
<br />Been far away for far too long
<br />But you know, you know, you know
<br /><br />I wanted
<br />I wanted you to stay
<br />'Cause I needed
<br />I need to hear you say
<br />That I love you
<br />I have loved you all along
<br />And I forgive you
<br />For being away for far too long
<br />So keep breathing
<br />'Cause I'm not leaving
<br />Hold on to me and, never let me go
