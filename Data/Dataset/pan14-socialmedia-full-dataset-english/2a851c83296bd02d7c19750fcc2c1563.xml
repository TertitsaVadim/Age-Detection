<br />       We decided to arrive at 6 o'clock. Liz and I arrived at five thirty p.m. The restaurant was in Jin Lun Xin Tian Di. It was in the downtown. I thought they chose this restaurant because it was in the city centre, and the food tasted good.
<br />       I ordered a Grilled Beef Tenderloin. It looked very delicious and beautiful. I tasted the beef, and I thought it was very nice so I liked the food. It was different from the food I usually ate. My main food was rice. However, the most food I ate that day was beef. It was a big difference. The restaurant was big. The light in the restaurant was soft. There were many small balls on the wall. Those balls made the restaurant more beautiful. People in the restaurant didn’t speak loudly so it was very quiet. There were a few people having dinner there. I think there was a husband and a wife eating there. There were also three young girls. The waiters and the waitresses were very kind. They helped each of us to order the food. They were very patient. The good service made us eat happily. I thought the food and the service were both very good, but I thought the price of the food was a little expensive. 
<br />       I think Henry’s Home is a very good place to have dinner with your friends. I had a good time in the restaurant. I will not forget the experience.

Since I came to GCA, I have this chance to find some volunteer work, and I felt happy when I did those volunteer works.
<br />           I did my first volunteer work in the Grade 10 Parents’ Meeting. It was the first parents’ meeting; so some parents were not familiar to our teachers and education system, and they did not know who to ask. My job was to tell the parents some information about our teachers and homework. I learned that it was very happy to help with others, and I found that I am a useful person. After that, I began to do some more volunteer work.
<br />          Then I began to teach an exchange student, Jenna, Chinese. I have taught her for seven classes. In two classes, I talked to her about her school life in America in Chinese, and I told her how to say a sentence more oral. In one class, I taught her some Chinese measure words , such as piece, dozen and bag in English. I thought it was difficult to teach this because there are many measure words in Chinese, and it was hard to explain these to a foreigner. In other four classes I helped her to read some small paragraphs correctly. I felt extremely glad to teach Jenna because I thought Chinese is becoming increasingly common in the world, and I did a small job to let a foreigner learn Chinese well. I found Jenna was very friendly, and she was hard-working. I also thought I need to prove my Chinese level and English level; so that I can teach Jenna Chinese in a easier and better way.
<br />           Next, I did some volunteer work for Halloween. I needed to have the ability to decorate the lobby. I hang a big black-green cloth on the door. Then I did some cutting. I cut some bats, and I hang them on the roof of the lobby. I thought the bats was very good, and it was the symbol of Halloween. We made the lobby very good and have the atmosphere of Halloween. From this thing I found that I was not very careful and my companies were careful. Generally, I think the job I did was successful, and I need to learn some others’ abilities to let me be more practical.
<br />           In the winter holiday I went to Nanjing Library to do volunteer work. The worker in the library let me to make the books neat. To do this task, I needed to be very careful and fast because I needed to make nine rows of books. The books were a little bit messy. I needed to make the books in a line, therefore the books look very neat, and it is very easy for readers to find books. At first, I did very slowly, but I did faster after I did a while. After I finished doing these things, I looked at the books I had cleaned up and felt very pleasure. I became more careful after I did this. 
<br />           From doing these volunteer works, I found that I need to improve myself in many ways, and I found that in some ways, I could do very well. I know myself much deeply now. I will go on doing volunteer works for others and for myself because I think it is a great thing to help others.

My friends’ and I went to there at about 6 o’clock in the afternoon. The restaurant was called Les 5 Sens, and it was very close to our school.
<br />    The restaurant was not very large, but I liked it. The environment was very clean, and the decorations were very special. I thought that was the style of French restaurant. I also thought the atmosphere in the restaurant was very romantic because the tables were small and the lights were not very bright. Generally I thought it was a wonderful place for boyfriends and girlfriends to have date in the evening. 
<br />     After looking around the restaurant, we sat down and began to order the dishes. I saw the prize, I found that it was expensive to me; therefore I only ordered a Lasagna with Green Salad. I thought it was not only very good-looking but also very delicious; so I liked it. I also ate a few dishes in my friends’ plates, and I thought I was not used to eating it. Although I did not like my friends’ food very much, but I thought it was very original. It was a good place to have French food. Then I walked around in the restaurant, and I saw some foreigners eating there. I also saw a couple having dinner there.
<br />    The service there was good. The waitresses were very patient to answer our questions. In all, I thought it was a wonderful place to have French Food. If you are fond of having French food, you can go there with your friends.

The exhibition was held in Jiangsu Art Gallery. There were many oil paintings in the gallery. Some paintings were abstract, and some paintings were realistic.
<br />  When I entered the exhibition, I was attracted by the biggest painting in the exhibition. It is about 6400cm². The name of the painting was Red Moonlight. It was made by Wu Xiao Xun in 2010. It is a realistic painting, and it’s monochromatic. The background of the painting was a big light red moon. In front of the red moon, there are five young female soldiers. They were wearing military uniforms, and the uniforms were light red. The five girls were having long hair and they were in different poses. I thought it was very harmonious. 
<br />  When I saw the painting, I was attracted by it. The painting let me feel very comfortable and relaxed. The colours were harmonious. In the painting, the five girls are beautiful. From their uniforms, I know that they are serving in the war. From their eyes, I think they are very adamant. They want to win the war. The painting makes me think that there were many female soldiers dead in the wars in the nineteen and twenty centuries. This artwork also reminds me of a famous young woman. Her name is Jiang Jie. She was also a soldier in the war. The enemy wanted to get some information from her, but she didn’t say anything. In the end, she was killed. The artwork is related to some different wars in the world. The artwork is monochromatic; so I think of our art class. In our art class, we did monochromatic painting before. We can’t use colour very well, but the painter was very professional. He used the colour very smoothly. In all, I think the artist’s intention is to praise the female soldiers. The female soldiers were almost very young. If they didn’t serve in the war, they may meet a good boy and have a happy family. However, some of them died because they fought for their country. This spirit is very noble-minded; therefore I like this painting.
<br />  Generally I think it’s a successful and great artwork because the artist used the colour very well. The light red colour let us feel the female soldiers are not only beautiful but also stalwart. I love this painting; however I will not buy it because the painting is big. I don’t think it’s suitable for my house. I think good painting is for audience to enjoy, and I can’t have it.
<br />There were also many nice painting in the exhibition, and they are belonging to different styles. I think I need to go to exhibitions more often; so I can enjoy more and more kinds of artworks. There are many things I need to know, and it’s good for me to relax myself. In the art gallery everyone is very quiet. I think they don’t want to use their loud voice to make the paintings less beautiful. They all respect the paintings. I think that art can give people a place to think and relax. This is the feeling after I visited the exhibition.

His name is Wang Cong Li, and he is a friend of my mother. He is an artist, a sculptor and an art store owner. I interviewed him in his art store.
<br />The store was small; however there were many paintings in it. When I went into the store, he was chatting with other artists and drinking tea. He looks a little bit old, and I didn’t think that he looks like an artist. I also thought that his life was relaxed.
<br />  Then I started to interview him. Firstly I shaked hands with him and introduced myself. Then I began to ask questions. 
<br />  Firstly, I asked what his job involves and when he had started to do this job. He said that he was an artist and a sculptor. He liked to draw flowers and bird, and he also interested in sculpting different Chinese words on the wood. He began to study painting when he was 17 years old, yet he started to sculpt when he was about thirty. Secondly, I ask him about how to draw and sculpt artwork beautifully. He replied to me that practicing, patience and thinking are very important. He said that he had practiced drawing for twenty years and kept improving himself. He also needs to keep thinking how to change normal things into beautiful and unique paintings.  I responded to him that in our study, we also need to practice a lot to get high marks and keep thinking how to improve myself in many ways. Thirdly, I asked him how long it took him to paint or sculpt one normal work. He told me that he was able to draw and sculpt in a short time; however he needed to obtain inspiration and constructed basic composition first. He also told me that he could control his time well so he didn’t have to draw one painting every month. About the fourth question, I asked him what the biggest problem it was when he did his job. He thought for a few minutes, and said that he was extremely sad two years ago. He paid much attention to sculpting. At the beginning his artwork was rare, and not beautiful; therefore nobody liked them and bought them. Now more and more people know this kind of carving and start to like them. About the sixth question, I asked what kind of achievement he had made. He said that he had gotten some small rewards, for instance, the third prize in Jiangsu Guohua Competition. He didn’t think the prize was important for him, he just wanted to pay attention to painting and sculpting. In the end, I asked him who his favourite artist is. He said that Beihong Xu was his favourite artist because of the vivid horses he painted, and his achievement in Paris. 
<br /><br />Finally, I finished the interview, and I took a picture with him. I think it’s not easy to work and study at the same time for anyone. For him, he needs to keep practicing and thinking to improve himself. For me, I need to keep practicing to improve my study and think how to go beyond others. Everyone needs to work hard in his profession otherwise he will be caught up by new people. Through interviewing an art professional, I studied a lot from him and I need to change my habit. I have to take advantage of what I get today for tomorrow’s happy life.

I continued to teach an exchange student Chinese almost every week and I also went to Purple mountain to pick some trash. I think these activities are both very interesting and meaningful. Then I want to talk about these two volunteer experience. 
<br />Firstly, I want to talk about teaching an exchange student, Jenna, Chinese words. Jenna is a hard-working student because she often find some new Chinese words to remember. Sometimes, I taught her how to read Chinese words correctly. I found that I am even not sure how to read some easy words because we always say the words incorrectly. I think that I also need to check some sound for these words so that I will not teach her wrong things. Sometimes, I taught her some new words and used easy way to make her understand the meaning of the words. I also faced some small problems in it. For example, the meanings of some words were similar, but they were using in different ways so I didn’t know how to let her understand them and use them correctly. From this problem, I thought that learning a new language is a very tough thing. Foreigners always think Chinese is difficult because many sentences are not easy to be understood just from the words. Many Chinese also think it’s hard to understand some English sentences, and we always make grammar mistakes. Sometimes Jenna gave me some Chinese words to let me teach her. I found that some words I had never heard before, and I think they are very strange. Then it reminded me of my English. I sometimes used Chinese to find some English words in my e-dictionary, and my teacher would think it was very strange. From teaching Jenna Chinese words, I knew that talking with a foreigner is a good way to improve my English. 
<br />Then I start to talk about picking up trash in Purple Mountain. I went to pick up trash with my mother and her colleagues. I used a pair of pliers to pick up the trash. I needed to open my eyes bigger to find rubbish. I found that there was a lot of trash on the ground. The most rubbish I had picked was the rest of cigarettes. I didn’t notice them before I started to pick up rubbish. Everybody knows that it’s very dangerous to throw the cigarette in the grass because it is possible to cause a fire. Some other people threw food on the ground, and I thought they were disgusting because there maybe were some virus on them. I picked up just a little part of the total rubbish in Purple Mountain. In the end, our group picked up twenty small bags of trash. From this volunteering activity I think everybody should take a bag when they are traveling outside because he can throw his trash in the bag and then throw it into the dustbin.
<br />I learnt a lot from doing volunteer work. I noticed some small things in my daily life. My volunteer works make my life more happily so I will continue to do it. From helping others, I can be more realistic and careful because there always some small problems 
<br />during helping people.

		<document id="7d3bed9eba0415dcdb867a04b4c39c4c" url=""><![CDATA[School Club<br/><br/>I joined two clubs at GCA; the first one was Art Club. The other one is Underground Drama Society. These two clubs are both very wonderful, and I would like to continue to work in the clubs.
<br />Firstly, let me introduce Art Club. This club was built by Ms.Hadley and Eva. There are about twenty Grade 10 students, and there are less than 10 Grade 11 students. In the club, we had a lot of different things to do such as drawing a picture for Halloween, painting on a T-shirt and painting on the walls in the Art room. I needed to be careful and creative to do these things. When I drew the Halloween picture with Sarah and Eileen, we finished drawing very fast because we could work for different parts at the same time. I think drawing on the wall is the most difficult thing I did in Art Club. My job was to draw different rectangles between two straight lines. I needed to be very careful so that the extra colour would not be drawn on the wall. I often made mistakes so I needed to use white colour to cover them.  From doing these tasks, I learnt that it is really important to do things carefully any time because I can’t correct my mistakes in life some time. This club is a new club so there are not many students, and the leader of the club does not have some organizing experiences. However, the club members are all very interested in art; they all love painting and try their best to complete their work. The club has also helped GCA to build a haunted house in Halloween. I enjoyed this club because it let me be much more careful in my daily life. I will continue to work for this club.
<br />Then let me introduce Underground Drama Society. This is an old club. Before I attended GCA, this club had organized a drama. This club was built by Mr.Burt, and the leaders of the job are Vermoutha and Fan. In the last term, Mr.Burt gave us a play which was called And Then There Were None. It’s a mystery play in three acts by Agatha Christie. I was not one of the characters in the play, but I was one of the subtitles. I needed to go to practice every day because I needed to take the place of the absence person to read. I had read three characters; so I could understand the play well. I also needed to read the play like the character in it. I found that other members can speak English much more smoothly than I can. Before I entered the club. I thought my oral English was good; however when I joined this club I knew that my English still need to be improved. The club was very big so that it’s much easier for our members to organize a play, but the play is very hard to play. In the end, we stopped practicing this play and we decided to make a new one in the next term. I hope I can play a role in the next play.
<br />These are my club activities, and I had a lot of fun in the clubs. I will join some more clubs next year so that I can experience much more different things. I will still stay in Art Club and Underground Drama Society next year, and I want to make a process next year.

Now I am at GCA, there is not much homework and we have to do physical activities. I think it’s interesting.
<br />There was a gymnasium near my home, and there was?a badminton coach in the gym. I decided to learn to play badminton with him. I didn’t have any badminton lessons before, but I had played with my classmates in my previous school. I thought that playing badminton is very easy; however I was wrong. It’s not easy to learn step by step. Firstly, the coach taught me some basic  footwork and an important action. Every class, the coach asked me to do the basic footwork  and the basic action for five times. The coach also told me that the way I held the racket was wrong, and my right hand needs to change the holding way in the right half court and left half court. At the beginning, I was easy to be tired in thirty minutes. Now I can play for the whole class. I was able to do the action very well, but I didn’t know why I could not do the action well during playing badminton. The teacher gave me the bird ,and I knew that he wanted to use the basic action to play; however I often did in a wrong way. Sometimes my coach was very angry at me. and I felt I was very stupid. After training for fifteen classes, I finally can do the action smoothly, and I am proud of myself. I found that every sport is not easy to learn, but they are good for my health. I always feel relaxed after having a badminton class.
<br />I did not only learn to play badminton, ?also went to the park near my home to learn rollerblading. I went to learn it because I saw many foreign students rollerblading in the movies, and I think it’s cool. I found that I was the oldest student there, and most of the students were four to seven years old. They could rollerblade much better than me. I was a little bit shy at the beginning because I am too old to those students. The coach told me that it’s very important to put the center of my gravity lower so that my feet would have more energy to do different actions. The coach also said that when you were running, you couldn’t be afraid. I practiced a lot to let me feel less afraid. I kept doing one action to do it in a professional way. I still felt a little bit afraid when I was running because I was always afraid I could not stop if I run too fast. Later, the coach taught me some interesting actions so that my rollerblading would be much more beautiful.
<br />I think playing badminton and rollerblading are both very difficult to learn now, and I need to keep improving these two physical activities. I found that doing physical activities is very useful for me to reduce my stress.

That was a comic play and its name is The Life Opinion of Two Dogs. The play was held in Jiang Nan Theatre and it began at 19:30. We arrived at seven o’clock, but the workers didn’t allow us to get in until 19:20.
<br />In the play there were only two persons, they played the role of two dogs. The two dogs went to a city to find work. They met a lot of problems during finding a good job. Sometimes, they were caught by city inspectors; sometimes, they were adopted by a rich family. They liked the food in rich family, but they didn’t like the bad habits of the master so they left the house. Then they decided to work in a sub district to make sure the people’s safety. But they didn’t like the job so they decided to join a acting competition, yet they didn’t win. Finally, they decided to went home. 
<br />I really liked this play because it used a comic way to reflect the truth in the cities. In Nanjing, many workers from rural area came here to find work. Many citizens look down upon them because they don’t have much knowledge. I think it’s a dog eat dog world now so a person who wants to get a satisfied job needs to have many abilities,  however we still need to respect the workers from rural area. I must work hard now, otherwise I will not have good job in the future.

<br />I thought the fair was interesting and I liked it because I had never seen a flower fair before. I found that there were thousands of Dutch tulips and Azalea in Xuan Wu Lake. 
<br />First, I saw the Azalea Fair. Workers used a lot of azalea to make different shapes, and I thought they were amazing. The azalea has many colour, some is red , some is purple and some is yellow. The workers also put some small azalea in a yard. I saw many people taking photos of the flowers.
<br />Then, I went to enjoy those beautiful Dutch tulips Fair. I was deeply attracted by those fantastic Dutch tulips because I had never seen such big and many Dutch tulips before. There were red, yellow, white and black Dutch tulips, and I took photos of all the Dutch tulips. I saw at least twenty newly married couples went to take their wedding pictures. 
<br />I think I was lucky because I can enjoy such beautiful flowers. Nanjing is a city with four distinct seasons so I can enjoy the flowers in spring and snow in winter.?I?don’t know whether there is azalea and Dutch tulips in Canada so I will go to find it when I go to study there.  I think the flowers in Canada may be different from flowers in Nanjing because of different climate. I am sure I will find it.

The activity was organized by Ms Bartell and Charles in 11-F. The name of the activity was Chance to Learn How to Cook a Western Food, and it was held at GCA from 9:00a.m.-12:00p.m.
<br />One of the grade 11 students taught Eva and me how to make biscuits. Firstly, we needed to mix a lump of butter and 35g sugar in a big bowl. The butter was solid so that it’s very tough for us to use chopsticks to mix them. We didn’t have patience to keep mix it so we started to put egg in them. Then we could mix them much easier because there were liquid things in an egg. After mixing them, we put a small bag of flour in to the bow and keep mix them. Sometimes we thought the flour was not enough , and sometimes we thought it was wrong to put all of the whole egg in the bowl.Finally, we successfully mixed all the materials together, and then we started to make the shape for our biscuits. Eva made a dolphin-like biscuit , and I made a bowknot. After making defferent shape of the biscuits, we put them into an oven , and the girl in Grade 11 told me that they need to be baked for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we put the biscuit out, and we found that the biscuit was parched. Many of them had become black. I tried one, and I thought it was disgusting.In the end, our biscuits were totally unsuccessful.
<br />From making biscuits, I knew that we need to follow the instructions to cook in the future. In my daily life, I always want to do things quickly so sometimes the result is not good. Now I know that I need to do things slowly and follow the instructions step by step because the instructions have already been used for many times.

I went to there because I only knew the church in Nanjing, and I want to get some information about Christianity. The church was located in Mo Chou Road.
<br />It was one of the oldest churches in Nanjing, and the appearance was Christian style. We entered in the church, and I saw there was a small stage in the front of the church. There were four words on the wall, and the pinyin of the four words was Yi Ma Nei Li. I asked a Christian for the meaning of the four words, and then she told me that it meant God is always with us.
<br />Eva and I asked a few questions about the Christianity. The Christian told me that there are activities every weekends?and they always read Bible first and then the choir will sing, and the priest will teach the Christian some thing. I asked her whether there are students join Christian. She said that they didn’t allow publicizing in the school; however there were some young workers joining Christiannity. Then I asked her how to join in the Christianity. She said it was a little bit complicated. First, the person need to listen to the priest’s teaching at least one year, and then he needs to sign to join a special class. He will have a small test after taking the class. In the end, there will be a small ceremony to let him join Christianity.
<br />I think it’s a good religion, and it’s free. People who believe Christianity are almost living happily. I am not interested in joining in any religion, but I want to know some things about each religion. I decided to go to visit a Catholic Church next term.

After I paid the tuition fee and had several lessons, I found that dancing was not an easy thing. From those dancing lessons, I knew that if you wanted to do something successfully, you must be hard-working and patient.
<br /> I had power jazz, new jazz and basic ballet classes in the dancing center, and I believe that dancing was good for health. In classes, we needed to keep following teachers’ actions. Sometimes we must practice one action for five to ten times ;however I found that I could not dance very well even though I had practiced for several times. At the beginning, I didn’t know why teachers could dance beautifully, and I was not able to dance like teachers. After several classes, I knew that teachers had put all their efforts into dancing, and they usually danced when they were at leisure so that they had the abilities to dance vividly. From different dancing classes, I learned that hard-working and to keep improving were fundamental factors for a person to achieve a great achievement.
<br />  Dancing is one of my hobbies, but I need to put much of my effort into study so I don’t have enough time to dance. I went to dance only on Friday and Saturday nights, and I thought that exercises could improve my mark because I could relax myself from dancing . I also believe that study and dancing are the same thing in some ways. For example, I would like to improve my science mark, and I also need to keep reading the book and doing practices. 
<br />  Dancing classes are very important for me to keep fit, and I am sure that I will continue this exercise. Physical activities are fundamental in our daily life so everyone should do some exercise for our health and work.
