At one end of the spectrum, 31% are &#8220;Super Tech Adopters,&#8221; who report broad ownership of the major computing <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/three-in-10-in-u-s-own-an-array-of-consumer-electronics/#more-27745" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

That was a topic of discussion at Ars Technica just before the holidays hit, and readers weighed in on what exactly a smartwatch should feature. The general consensus is that today’s models just aren’t there yet. A long battery life and a smooth operating system aren’t enough for smartwatches to <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/waiting-for-a-better-smartwatch/#more-27702" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

For those are not aware of RSA Animate, think TED Talks but drawings or animations instead.  The ones I have seen are good, really good. I frequently say during my trainings, workshops, and lectures that empathy is one of the most important <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/the-power-of-empathy/#more-27705" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

I heard almost every question imaginable, but the one that made the least sense was this: &#8220;How do I change my settings on LinkedIn so that people won&#8217;t see <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/no-need-to-fear-profile-updates/#more-27696" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

		<document id="8d4875384c0bb4388821afe1680269d" url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adrtoolbox/~3/Ii9TuvtfDHg/"><![CDATA[<img width="512" height="362" src="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Perp-Walk.jpg" class="attachment-large wp-post-image" alt="Securities Fraud" />Next spring, in the Halliburton case, the United States Supreme Court is expected to reconsider the Basic ruling that, twenty-five years ago, adopted the fraud-on-the-market theory and has since facilitated securities class action litigation. In this paper we seek to contribute to the expected reconsideration. We show that, in contrast to claims made by the <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/rethinking-basic-fraud-on-the-market/#more-27731" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

What if you could put three or four or even dozens of heads to the task? If you could tap into a collective, collaborative research process, it seems fair to say, you could complete your work more quickly and <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/two-sites-offer-platforms-for-crowdsourced-legal-research/#more-27712" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

Chief U.S. District Judge Jerome Simandle in Camden, N.J., found that despite the arbitration clause, the handbook also contained language disclaiming creation of any employment contract. In addition, the company <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/furniture-dealers-arbitration-clause-just-veneer-judge-says-in-bias-case/#more-27715" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>

First, effective October 1, the AAA’s revised Commercial Arbitration Rules make several important changes to the arbitration process.  All of the changes are summarized on the AAA’s website, <a href="http://www.adrtoolbox.com/2014/01/notable-aaa-arbitration-rule-revisions-in-2013/#more-27700" class="more-link">Continue reading &#8594;</a>
