Here white petunias are cut with scissors to make a name, values are placed as if they were tarot cards, and approximations of the sublime are revealed in mathematical detail. 'Country Without a Name' recalls the work of Dada poet Tristan Tzara (whose name means 'country' in Romanian) and the semi-autobiographical pharmaceutical quests and cut-up text collages of William S. Burroughs. Bogle rebels, defines and ultimately defies hierarchies. Her writing, manifesto-like, hints at what might have been learned from Andre Breton’s Nadja if we had been given her diary to read, along with the idea that non-being dwells in language the same as being does, or in Bogle’s words: ‘Not to be she is embodied’."</span></div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">--Morgan Harlow</span>?</div>

Poets consider developments in fiction less than I consider developments in poetry. My security breach in broaching fiction and creative nonfiction at The Argotist Online, where my poems have appeared, the offense of it to you, has indirectly helped me to understand poetry's segregation of genres, similar to the separation of prose narrative (fiction and cnfic) and poetry in American creative writing programs and within most literary journals. Genre is a passion for me, and I like to quote Lyn Hejinian, "prose is not a genre but a multitude of genres." <br />5 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Anny Ballardini Well, we have prose poetry <br />5 hours ago via mobile • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle PP/FF, the title of Peter Conner's anthology of prose poetry and flash fiction, is another guide for me, both in considering musical applications to prosetics and the differences between pp/ff. <br />5 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side Ann, your opinions on prose fiction are not offensive to me in the least. They are just inappropriate subject matter for a poetry discussion group. Why don’t you start an FB group for your ideas? I’m sure it will be welcomed. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Rich Haber hey jeff, here's an idea for you: fuck off, you pretentious fop. and ann, why bother? my ex once gave me a miraculously helpful piece of advice - never stay where you're not wanted. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber censorship is bad enuff from mainstream asswipes, but among artists? it's totally shitbox <br />5 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Jeff cross-posted his statement (above) at The Argotist Online then removed me as a member of that group. May I request that you let The Argotist Online group know that you have not canceled my voice and related posts at OtherStream in case they care to respond directly. <br />5 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Jeff, you wear a powdered wig and have a heart beauty-mark on your face? I never imagined you like that. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber lol - what's language all about, if you cant stretch denotations into connos, eh mate? <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side I’ve always wanted a mate who doesn’t use punctuation. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side … apart from after the contraction “connos”, that is. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Rich Haber, I appreciate your awareness and support, but reserve the imperative use of fuck for unnamed soldiers who kill, maim, and dislocate civilians. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber whew, smells of authoritarianism in here. putz <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side Yes, Jeff, Ann is right. I am not a soldier, and so to say “fuck” to me is not right. <br />5 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Rich Haber hmm, good point, ann. but i'm from bklyn. fuck isnt reserved at all. i'm not reserved. wouldnt wanna be anything like it, neither, double negs not withstanding. or understanding, fer that matter. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Chris Watts Glad I stayed the fuck out of that one... I love you all, love reading you all, so there. <br />5 hours ago via mobile • Like • 3 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side I never use four letter words unless I’m ejaculating. <br />5 hours ago • Unlike • 2 <br />o <br />Rich Haber "...and I love ehhh vreee bahh deeee, since I fell in love with YOU!" <br />5 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side That’s the most sensible thing you’ve said up to now. <br />5 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Rich Haber, one guy at an A.A. mtg. in St. Cloud gained the sympathy of the group by clarifying that the U.S. had trained him to be a killer and he had ret'd from Iraq and hit a man at a bar for which he was charged and sentenced to attend A.A., itself a form of religion. I was in attendance with a friend and told her before the mtg. I did not wish to identify myself as an alcoholic, though it was a "closed" meeting, open only to self-described alcoholics, and she said, say that you have a desire not to drink alcohol, the only requirement of membership, so when it was my turn, I said, "My name is Ann. I have a desire not to drink alcohol." My presence that night was regarded a little suspiciously but I thanked them for letting me attend at the request of my friend. <br />5 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Ann Bogle So, there was my chance to say fuck you to a killer, and I didn't do it. I thanked him and the others for letting me sit in the room as an out-of-town visitor of my friend. <br />4 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Rich Haber i've done some serious work, trying to reconcile my ambiguity about our volunteer armed servicemen and women - kinda lengthy to jump into here. in short, my feelings and thoughts surround those who would sacrifice their own lives for their "countrymen" <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber conflicting with nationalism vs one big world family <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Hm, that's interesting. Instead of sacrificing yourself for your countrymen, you refuse to fight so that you may forge a relationship with your world country. I like that. <br />4 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Because god knows, these days it's not your "countrymen" or "countrywomen" you're fighting for, but the Oligarchy who sent you out to protect their interests. <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber never said that, jeff. truth is, i dont have the guts to shoot anyone. but the sad fact, that all these military families are so misguided and confused, is just sickening. their bravery and loyalty is ignored - as in song Universal Soldier. <br />4 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Rich Haber and the oligarchy cant send soldiers if the soldiers wont go. <br />4 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Of course, but why wouldn't they go? They want to be rich, right? If you don't play the game, you don't maybe might gonna be rich someday, right? So play the game, or we ain't gonna let you be rich, kid! <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber you must be young. we antiwar activists started antiwar groups INSIDE the military, during the viet nam "police action" - nothing that size is happening now, but there is an iraq vets antiwar group, joined at the hip, with the viet vets group and vets for peace group - very difficult, getting soldiers to turn on their officers and say - Sir, that order is illegal, Sir! <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber joining the army isnt about getting rich. never was. they were the lowest paid workers in the working class, worldwide. nowadays, different story, with the corporatists transforming us into a military society - man, we are so wayyyy off topic. so jeff, you are not the other jeff's alter-ego? another cyber-identity, using another IP address? <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Dude, you're not thinking laterally. We play by the rules in this country because we all want to stay in the game, and the game is getting rich. Nobody wants to disobey, because then they get put in the penalty box, i.e., jail, and despite free room and board and all the sex you can stand, jail's no fun.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">And no, I am not Jeff Side. If I was an alter ego of his, do you really think I'd call myself Jeff? I'd call myself Rich Haber. <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side I can vouch that Jeff is not me. I would never use the word "dude" when addressing an older person than myself. <br />4 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Rich Haber lol oh u kids. i'm no military expert but we used to chant "Just turn back if the orders are whack!" - the basis was that any soldier is morally and legally bound to refuse to obey an order that is "illegal" under the articles of war, as laid out in the geneva conventions <br />4 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson In California, we call everyone Dude. It's a term of great respect among our kind. <br />4 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle ANN BOGLE, ANN BOGLE is my blog post that links to Kevin Thurston's blog, Fucking Lies (Polite Happiness) and a poem posted there written by Han Scrable called "Scrable on Bogle." My correspondent, B'go, in considering the poem Scrable wrote, offered lines Bob Dylan owned before he gave them to the world. B'go writes, "I was thinking that as far as extemporaneous prosody on cigarette shops that this was the gold standard." <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber omg AB at her best. oh ouch <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber well u got yer Major Dudes and ur minor chords and it's just too sadly bad when poetry sails and prosody fails, among cheers and jeers and what have we heres <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber rich, to day-job boss, "I'm soooo sorry I quit" <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Dylan's extemporaneous prosody on cigarette shops the gold standard. Jeffrey Side, this is what might be described as a "successful' thread with its passions and participants loving and fighting. Do you feel it might reach those academics you most hope to persuade of your arguments in poetics? As I asked in WHAT at F'naut without your answer, who are they you most hope to persuade? I claimed that in your recent jottings in comment threads on FB that it seemed you had "enemies" in mind with names, you used the word "enemy" to describe academic gatekeepers of post-avant (not your word, that's Adam Fieled's) academic poetry. If you cultivated similar enemies? Would that help your position academically? Protestant heritage not belief causes me to fault behavior not men. <br />4 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side The digressive development of this current thread (entertaining as some of it has been) is the reason I removed you from the Argotist group. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber frumpified foppery, frugally fritting fruffery thru the tulips of triangarulation - tut-tut, i say, get thee to a nunnery. whatta waste of good oxygen. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Luis Lemus Attica, Attica... #FistRaisedinSolidarity (smile) Aren't artists supposed to stand together, fraternal bickering aside? I have read this and other threads trying to discern the point of this brouhaha only to ultimately conclude this is a tempest in a teacup. Make art, not war. The forums for writer and artist are a pretty small sandbox; let's play together (smile). Peace. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Ann Bogle's extemporaneous prosody on Ann Bogle is the Ann Bogle of this thread. Ann Bogle. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side I agree, Luis. Rich obviously doesn’t like me because I removed Ann from the Argotist group for perfectly legitimate reasons. I can understand his loyalty to her as a friend (I assume he is a friend) but there’s no need for him to be abusive to me. Even Ann hasn’t resorted to that—at least not yet. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Jeffrey Side, you had represented (though I might have wanted an editor in you besides) my e-chapbooks, so, for that career-related investment I had made with you, I failed to defend Bobbi Lurie more fully (by disassociating from you? retracting my e-books?) when you described her as psychotic in an email. The links to my e-books are probably still working. Rachel Lisi designed the cover of one of them, and Daniel Harris gave ten illustrations. All I wanted to say, and you are avoiding the subject rather stupidly, is, and I said it in more than one place and way, your poetics collection of essay, responses, etc. and fight with Seth Abramson about it, did not name names in a way that might have been useful in considering or applying your arguments. Your cry that it went by not celebrated caused me to plunge in as a reader preparing to review your email correspondence, Other Voices, with Jake Berry. Jake, in turn, took a dip, a little swim, in my prosetics, and responded kindly. I am in your coral as a writer, and you are revoking my digressive strategies. It seems strange you represented my collections as e-books unless you were aligning yourself in another silent debate in poetry. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle And btw prosody is a system of versification. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber digression=development=devolution=dissolution=de-salvation=salivation=spit=jackshit <br />3 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson Scatological versification. <br />3 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle 59 <br />3 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Rich Haber ok, jeff, calling my dear friend bobbi psychotic is beyond whatever shitball i rolled out for you. i'm not obliged to be polite because you deserve human respect. you don't. you're just a waste of time. this is my last posting to you, scumbag. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle I feel sorry that Carol cannot select "like" for Jeff Swanson's comment about volunteer army defending oligarchy. Carol Novack, love you Carol, is broke, something she'd always feared but that was not likely to occur in her lifetime, I told her, and it didn't. I miss Carol. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 3 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side Ann, I was unaware that the links to your ebooks were not working. I will correct that. If I had intended to remove the actual ebooks I would not have left them as listed on the site. If that is what all your silliness is about, then you should have told me the links were inactive instead of causing trouble here. I assumed you were more mature than this.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Regarding my saying Bobbi Laurie was psychotic. I said her emails to me had become psychotic and confusing to me, much like your posts here have been. Here is the email exchange you and I had about it. The first email is my response to your asking if I would do an ebook of her poems, which I initially refused to do, but later agreed to.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Me:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">I've had dealings with Bobbi Lurie in the past, and to be frank it wasn't all that pleasant. Her email exchanges with me became more and more psychotic and confusing, and her tone and language were belligerent towards me. Sorry for my negativity, and I appreciate your trying to help her out.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">You:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Thanks for letting me know of the experience you've had with Bobbi, as sad as it makes me to hear it. I have had to make my way carefully with Bobbi myself, as I know her life circumstances have not been easy, and she becomes suddenly distrustful. The internet, especially, though she is a good writer there, sometimes even better than good, at times deluges her with confusion.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Me:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">The only way I could consider doing an ebook for her is if you or Marc Vincenz act as intermediaries for me.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">You:</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: normal; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Sound good.

Thanks so much, Jeff. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber in case anyone is interested, bobbi's son Noah just went blind and she is recuperating from an ear operation. i will forward anything anyone wants to send her. <br />2 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Jeffrey Side, I did not type that the links were not working. <br />2 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side You said I retracted your ebooks. <br />2 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Luis Lemus Jeff (not to take) Sides: ultimately my loyalties lie with AB and not C, as she is at the very least an acquaintance of long standing and someone whose work I respect utterly. You also have some respectable offerings, therefore urging respectful restraint and understanding on all sides. Abrazos. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Jeffrey Side, define "psychotic" then. You are wildly evasive. Who knew you were wild? I wrote "distrustful" and you are not? I wrote "confusion" and you are not confused. Bobbi knows about this correspondence that Jeff quotes here, accurately (it is plain that Jeff and I do not have day jobs), painstakingly, and ... okay, Princess Di ... <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side Luis, I have nothing against Ann. She seems to think I retracted her ebooks that I published, which I have not—the links to them are just broken, which I will fix. This is the cause, it seems, for all the trouble she is causing. All she had to do was email me, let me know the links were broken and I would have fixed them. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Bob Spryszak you're all wrong... the word fuck is an aphrodisiac.

Or you misread quickly once. I asked whether your refusal to issue e-book by Bobbi after you had engaged in a long (?) personal correspondence with her, ought to have required (of me) that I retract my e-books and dissociate from you. I have not stated that the links are not working or that you retracted the e-books. You have stated that, and you are misquoting me. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeff Swanson There is more personality on display here than in a hundred ordinary internet locations. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 2 <br />o <br />Rich Haber ps - luis, you are a true peacekeeper. glad to make your acquaintance. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side I thought you were complaining about the broken links. It seems you are not. What you do regarding Bobbi is up to you. I did agree to do an ebook for her, but refused to deal with her directly as I can’t get on with her and nor she me. I asked you to act as go-between, which you agreed to. But I’ve not heard anymore about the matter from you, until now. <br />2 hours ago • Like • 1 <br />o <br />Rich Haber pps Bob Spryszak who is that guy in your ID pic? <br />2 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Ann Bogle Jeffrey Side, in the real publishing world, writers have agents. Your proposal to publish her e-book as long as there were a "sane" chaperone was rejected, by her, in full awareness of your opinion of her correspondence with you. <br />2 hours ago • Like <br />o <br />Jeffrey Side Well, Ann, all I can say is that you are very underhand showing her my email behind my back.

The suspicion was fearsome at first; nonetheless, I quickly accepted it as an excusable aspect of family life. I was much more ferocious on the subject of adult male violence against women who were too trusting of them. After I was attacked in my apartment, I asked my father, in near hysteria, whether he had done such a thing. "No," he said emphatically, an answer I have upheld to this day. I was too beside myself to tell him about the recent attack, out of a different sort of worry or fear. My father was a good but not a rich man, a microbiologist not a doctor, a churchgoer not a Jew or an atheist, a WWII army veteran who stayed in the US while his cousin was shot down over France. We were living in holocaustal times, just following the first US attack on Iraq. That nervous, yet important exchange, not the best and fortunately not the last in what had been a dear father-daughter interest, was not on record.<br /><br />Six months later, when two fellow graduate students took me to a psychiatric "hospital" in west Houston, no one mentioned false or blocked memory theory, but I was drugged. The woman graduate student was a Republican from southern California and told me it was CIA. I had worried intently that the graduate students at the school I attended were document thieves and village copiers, and to some extent, I know that they were kids; a few of them were wonder kids.<br /><br />I realized, but not in time to save my own or his life by thought or deed, that the block or difficulty was my own in living in our times. No one I knew deserved my love or trust, except my touchingly humble father and a very small and unrelated group of good souls I had had the positive fortune to know. Instead, I had trusted too many for too little reason. I had given too much ear, when less ought to have been required. I had withheld my dislike too often. I had learned to be a minor to every major whiner around. Life might have kept its curve had I cultivated my heart and not only my mind.</div>

RB was my teacher in Houston. She had built a reputation as a novelist, which she cared about more than the reputation she had built as a feminist. When she was my teacher, she wrote a “blockbuster” turned into a movie starring Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, but it wasn’t a story I cared about: a perfect white upper-middle-class family to whom one bad thing takes place and the ensuing complications -- what they lose. <strike>In reality, </strike>RB was [sophisticated and] <strike>a </strike>down-to-earth <strike>earth mama type I personally liked</strike>. She had <strike>a little shrimp of </strike>a husband who was good to her and an educator in his own right, though not a professor, an educator of high school students, and two grown daughters, who had, naturally, all made good decisions in life.<br /><br />Our student group were seen as people who had almost all come from bad families. The school picked the handful of perfect cheerleaders who had grown up -- we were ten years past high school -- and promoted them to careers as poets and writers. The rest of us they duped, paid us a pittance to work 60-hour weeks and left it at that. Economics is so very important to my discussion.<br /><br />We were taught, via United Church of Christ and in our early Presbyterianism (as children), that we have one life -- not many, not karma (which is from Hinduism and should not be correlated to Christianity), not afterlives, though there is an afterlife. In our tradition, afterlife was “transcendence and light” and hell was “exile from God.” "Transcendence" meant without bodies, as did "exile." Soul was elemental to worship; spirit meant harmony in the beauty and peace of nature. My religious, yet private inner interpretations were good for me as a child, not harmful. Religion becomes even more important later, since it is more likely to include rather than to exclude people, as employment excludes.<br /><br />Class is an issue. Those who knew where they wanted to find themselves later had boasted -- your father was a lawyer; Leni’s was land rich; Rona would marry -- and planned accordingly. I had not boasted about all the professions that were in my extended family: my father a corporate microbiologist, teachers, farmers, dentist, chemist, photographer, woman physicist, psychiatrist, business woman, women-behind-the-men, behind the women and children, news broadcaster for Time-Life, and the others. Little financial help came from home due to my mother’s tight rein on finances.<br /><br />No one encouraged me otherwise: I needed to earn a low wage to survive. You and Leni saw yourselves as the rich girls in the group and didn’t help us psychologically toward survival. Men needed us to be lower than they. The men I knew were not prospering financially, often, but were in the arts. I was not raised to “marry for money,” either, so it did not occur to me to try to do so -- I gave all of it away -- help especially -- for free and got little help in exchange. I had to file for bankruptcy. Rich men I met later wanted to be patriarchal toward me, and I was and am resistant to that, still.<br /><br />If even one person had known me better: my mother, my father, you, Rona, Leni, other friends, Barry -- someone might have learned that I had wanted to major in comparative literature, not in English, and not in English THREE TIMES, but no one did know me well enough, and there were no academic advisors at any of the schools I attended except at Binghamton, and my “advisor” there was not paid to be an advisor; she just was one, my professor in Shakespeare and creative writing, since it was needed, and she realized it. That degree (M.A.) was my favorite.<br /><br />These were all mistakes -- not knowing even one person who knew me was a mistake, one you had not detected, and you were likely the most astute (about the psyches of other people) of all the people I had met up to that point, perhaps still. No one taught me to pursue what I wish, what I most want. I did that in terms of sexuality, because that was taught -- to define our sexualities -- but we were not taught to define ourselves outside of sexuality and writing.<br /><br />It is gay, another gay thing, that gay men have sexuality, and no one else, almost no one else, does. Women are not allowed to have their own sexuality, still; it always creates cataclysms and judgment if she does. And most men are conformists and fetishize the women’s bodies and demand that they be crafted and petite and free of body hair, heads dyed blond. Or else they are VERY mean, indeed.<br /><br />It is still my sexuality, to be with a man, and I stick to it. The ex-Catholics involved with giving therapy turned that into an illness, one treatable at 12-step groups: heterosexuality. They have no message for me. Those "doctors" were supposed to be nuns and nurses, so they became high-paid “therapists” instead and converted each drive inside someone to illness, disregarding sin and traditional teachings unless it came from other world religions. I do not place you in their group as a therapist because your training was so extensive by comparison to theirs -- they really had none in us nor we in them -- but they are supposed to supervise us.<br /><br />None of them knows a thing about employment. They ought to be held accountable for leaving their religion so sloppily, for insisting on a privilege system that doles out joy and families and physical comforts and appropriate work to the few, while reserving great swaths of bad life for the many. It is not something that is supposed to be able to happen to trained people -- more trained than they are -- yet it does.</div>

What is a bogle? What is a day off from doing nothing? From "nothing doing." What is a sun sign? What is a moon? What is a tsunami? What is a fraction? What is caring disorder? My favorite therapists (of eleven) were one, Murray, M.D. (adjustment disorder &amp; suburban housewife neurosis at 17 -- there were violent boys in our neighborhood who had enacted domestic abuse against me, perhaps as witnessed in their houses and about which few could actually afford to care since the alternative in education terms would seem to have been boys' schools all over again); four, Ms. Siebert, MSW (who resembled a happy, well-adjusted suburban housewife and mother herself and who served as a mother for me in urbania); five (Dr. Hall, a terrific male psychologist who gave no diagnosis but who suggested something my adorable friends got later -- a longer form of psychoanalysis intended for writers and artists), six (a psychiatric resident named Griff who refrained from diagnosing after a domestic assault, even though I told her that that plus writing were causing me to feel uncharacteristically religious); eight (Susan K., MSW); nine, (my all-time favorite, Deb Otto, MSW) and eleven (Dr. Honebrink, Ed. D.). Total years in therapy: Exactly eight. My worst therapist was number 10, Daniel Carlson, M.Div. He mocked me for wearing nice clothes into the city and wanted me to list every lousy person I had ever met, something I refused to do. My seventh therapist, in retrospect, was Micki Fine, M.Ed.<br /><br />Micki acquired me after Dr. Alan Hurwitz had diagnosed me with bipolar disorder in 1991. Religion and writing were related to mental illness, afterall. I had hoped I had just been hungry. Micki diagnosed me with PTSD right off, as if she were in a little quarrel with psychiatry. For three years, she got me to go faintly where I did my work, and she sneered at what I did for play: visit a quiet actors' bar. When I got a boyfriend three years later, she diagnosed me with a need for five twelve-step groups (AA, Alanon, Sex Addicts, Co-Sex Addicts, and Coda). My Ph.D. was toward English not toward chastity. She might have said to me, as my boyfriend's mother had said to him, 'You're not an alcoholic; you're a friendoholic." Or, "You sure are attracted to Catholics, aren't you?" But she didn't say that. My Catholic drinking friend, who had the same therapist, had five boyfriends, not five 12-step diseases. She was without diagnosis beyond having had a violent dad, her PTSD dating back to childhood; other writers we knew, gay or straight, had what is usually termed by the uninterrupted as "lovers." Love to the Catholic clinician sounded like a lifelong disease in certain men and women who are unauthorized to have it with members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Many years have flown by since, many of them without my active participation. Without meaning to or wanting to, I have ''achieved" eight years of adult celibacy; the only good one of those was my first in sobriety. My pelvic area aches for interior toning, for massage. I have dull-looking skin and my muscles look like loners. Micki was wrong about love and sex being only for the designated or the few and to speak of them as unnecessary.<br /><br />Almost everyone we knew was wrong about beer. Whereas before, I had accepted the general definition of alcoholic as someone who drinks a lot of beer, I now know it to be a mixed determination. In fact, I now know that beer drinkers are better people, even if they do run into aches and groans associated with their favorite form of sour dough. True, they're likely poorer people, but the men are more handsome. The women are a little swelly, perhaps, and may run an occasional sinus infection, but isn't it better to drink a few beers than to pill-pop (as if for recreation), to let her get a little braggy in her laugh now and then, her teeth a little bucked, than to brand her a bad mother when she isn't even a mother and wasn't one and will not now be one, despite a furious insistence on who she was as a person (I was a native Minnesotan Swedish/English/Scottish American Protestant young writer!) and a glorious capacity to reproduce still? Ice cold milk, milk with ice in it for me, then. Rounds.</div>

I read several reviews of the book, and it seems the New Narrative, begun in CA in the 1970s, was a retort to L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E writers (excuse me for omitting equal signs); its practitioners by extension today are sometimes queer and transgendered and for some of them, the goal is sex writing. The sex of writing.  On sex writing, more in a moment.  About LGBT, there's little on the web about transgendered wo/men, and by that I do not mean wo/men who wish to become the other sex surgically nor who believe themselves to have been born the other sex or transvestites.  I mean transgendered as in transgressed, to the point of not feeling membership in one's own or the other gender -- or perhaps gender transcended --personally or aesthetically.  On sex, what more is there to say about American censorship?  I write sex fairly well, and could, perhaps should, but it isn't what I was thinking about censorship -- elitism, politics, aesthetics, beliefs, competition -- when I was thinking it in the early 90s. I went to <span style="font-style: italic;">ebr</span> and started reading archives, something I hadn't done in a while.  There has been quite a lot of new scholarship on postmodernist writing practices among African-American writers.  That I'd followed in the form of African-American modernism or post- by definition.  I'm at this point thinking there's less reason to do an anthology of essays unless we have something "other" to add to the argument that personal cultural marginalization creates/demands formal experimentation.  It -- experimental -- has been defined as marginalization for now.  Linearity is reportedly a bugaboo in <span style="font-style: italic;">Biting the Error</span>, and according to one detractor, the book doesn't pin down what fails whom why -- writer/reader -- when and when not, in "linear" narration.  I don't know if you saw Zadie Smith's dismissal of postmodernism in the recent <span style="font-style: italic;">NYR of B</span> – postmodernism has concluded as a limited experiment, she writes.  I see much more than she to love about writers such as Swift and Barthelme and Borges and Calvino and Lorrie Moore, and in the shorter fiction forms.  There are hidden topics -- one is failure, either of the artist to create significant art -- to claim or suggest aesthetic or other marginalization as a limitation unrelated to that -- or for the art to fail to succeed with a wider audience.  And commercial issues.  W?H?A?T is the change in language practices that people are wary of or unable to control or define, especially in terms of prose/fiction?  Defined as: Style, design as opposed to form, though "formal" creeps into usage, as in "formal innovation."  Even as "etiquette."  Dismissed as "voice."  But look, a writer I met here who wrote a memoir of her family is teaching experimental writing around the country.  It's not based on how she writes but perhaps on whom she likes socially or whom she reads.  I read another roster of names of professors of experimental writing -- one I went to school w/ who wrote in the modernist and Southern traditions – yet whose practice pieces read like he was imitating Mark Twain.  That was young or early, a difference.  I imitated, too, one writer per story, for 12 stories –- I’m guessing -- including Barthelme after he had died, like a daughter impersonating a father. Prose inventors.  Prose inventions.  Inventions in prose.  We could invent a litmus test for that and explicitly declare what it is.  Or not. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I wrote too soon that I could get financing.  I am more solvent than in 2001.  I'm caring for a nasty alcoholic day and night and meeting many people while befriending few -- I can't easily use the phone at home because he's so often ranting unprintables.  The computer is supposed to be off-limits, but I prevail and use it, anyway amid a hailstorm of accusations that using a computer is the real mental illness &amp; that bipolar is fake. A din.  A stinking and loud place.  He must be the “producer.” Am possibly moving possibly an hour faster than here on the Hudson -- details pending.  Not to a man, for a man nor myself a man. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I'm working here w/ a Stanford Ph.D. who thought of everything 7 years after my frame of reference though she's 7 years older than I.  Stanfords apparently don't believe in cw as training and have tons of academic cw credits and credits w/ the non-academic poetic community.  To the point now of thinking that the only point is to write as well as I can.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">W?H?A?T 2 at Fictionaut, July 24, 2012: <a href="http://fictionaut.com/stories/ann-bogle/w%CF%80h%CF%80a%CF%80t-2">http://fictionaut.com/stories/ann-bogle/w%CF%80h%CF%80a%CF%80t-2</a></div>

When I returned to my hometown, I started going to A.A.  This was preprogrammed in me by a therapist who due to her religious background tried to require it of everyone in her clinical office who drank.  I had been asked to go to a therapist due to “bipolar disorder,” something I was told I had though I didn’t have mood swings—rapid, horizontal thoughts followed by slow reactions.  I had vertical liftoffs and low electrolytes.  At its peak, I felt like a helium balloon that had stopped at the ceiling in my living room and drifted downward but did not deflate.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When you first learn of bipolar or other mental disorders, you are hit:  The doctor believes you have a major mental illness for which there is no test or cure.  Later, you realize more.  Therapists make money, doctors do, pharmaceutical companies do.  With one or two strikes against one and credits easily erased, could I—could anyone—emerge not-parked from that economic-underground-airport-tunnel system?  Having friends helps, but what if you have low-balling, Hollywood-style friends?  What if you or your friends have moved?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A.A. presupposes that newcomers to the group have done bad things <i>to other people</i>.  They think it makes a better story instead of a worse one.  On the whole, my life, as only I could have known it, defied drinking stereotypes.  It had pleased me in remarkable ways.  Once you agree to begin A.A., it is expected that you will stay amongst them for life.  Here, except for pockets in the Midwest, people in general are TV-heads who rarely read except self-help and who show little appreciation for the arts.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There, meaning South, my drinking (mostly beer) was in the spirit of friendship.  We went to an evening actor’s bar that was not violent and not a pick-up joint.  Actors met there after rehearsal.  There was a pool table, a jukebox, lit candles on small tables.  No one had a car accident until once.  Hardly anyone was stopped by police.  I went there too often:  That was what I had done.  Worse, I didn’t know it might be lowbrow to go out more often than my friends or to go out alone.  My friends didn’t know that my therapist disallowed boyfriends except hers.  She expected me to desert my life for 12-Step rec rooms even before anyone had introduced cocaine.  Celibacy was her idea of birth control, something we had had excellent instruction in as teenagers at the teen clinic where I had lived.  I didn’t suspect her of these subtexts, but I felt vaguely defiant.  I didn’t feel like watching TV after a day of grading papers and writing.  In that mix of sports and religion, TV was what there was of virtue.  I thought bars were nicer.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There were a few other “wrongs,” depending on how far A.A. wanted to take it.  I had ever had sex without being married.  Some of the A.A.s were having divorced “sober sex.”  One of those, a self-regarding sex goddess and mother of two Asian-American children, had started dating a retired African-American football player while still married to her Chinese doctor husband.  She had a friend in Hollywood, whose publicity photo she flashed at women’s dinners while urging sex on everyone.  I believed her coaxing us was healthy, and she needed a team to keep her culturally challenging life as a single mom going; besides me, her team were single moms without teams.  She was a realtor, who, like lawyers, made money at divorce.  I was not a landowner.  At first they pitied me for it.  Later, they wanted to skewer me for it.  Sex, as I realized not without embarrassment, was the privilege of divorced landholders.  The group’s few marrieds slept in separate rooms.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Outside the story: my feminist approval of the realtor as a woman in business; my later sense of her pretense as Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct; my feelings of friendship for her and the other members of the group; my affair with a man whose wife had suggested it, who was herself, as I left out then, attracted to black men; his later decision to have children with a woman who was next in the group; my caretaking propensity for alcoholics, heightened after I left the meetings fully programmed; my failure to find other or paid work.  (Writing is not work.)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The women, including me and except the sex goddess, had fallen to domestic violence.  Those women were fat.  Violence, including spiritual violence, was protected in the A.A. meeting.  The men were universally passive about reports of it, and the women tried to be serene.  I started to realize that the schisms between sex and sex and violence had contained hypocrisies related to being Catholic or to inter-religion, when I tried to leave.  Without relapsing, I had a serious breakdown in my isolation.  Many of my friends had been Catholic, and I had left myself little place to turn.  My best friend, speaking long distance, called me a loser.  She and her boyfriends—numerous and simultaneous—would be more successful and married.  Her drinking would not lead to A.A.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When people demand a bad story, one with murders and suicides in it, ordinary sinners who had liked church as I had, might feel caught as under a lamp.  I postulated that in our places, Jews and Catholics had been like the ink on the page, the words, the lines.  Protestants had been like the spaces, the paper, the page.  Protestants watched in the setting but not each other in the setting—we got to the point of staring straight ahead—quiet and forgetting to tell the story to our page.  We were sheets.  Some of us were trees that fell in the woods.  We would tell the middle of the story, stories about purpose and the quiet in life, about age, about the long span between birth and death.  They would tell stories about birth and death.  They—?—would live well day to day, even happily, and had many friends, but nothing compared in pleasure to the day the switch came, a day to ditch friends.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My writing teacher wrote that the Holocaust (what I thought of) is not the only or not necessarily “the disaster” in Maurice Blanchot’s <i>The Writing of the Disaster</i>.  I learned from attending A.A. that recovery from A.A. is never possible.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A woman feels burdened to spend an hour with her friend since they are not men.  Now, to write that with all the artistic command of language I ever thought I’d had.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>Appears at <a href="http://fictionaut.com/stories/ann-bogle/waylaid">Fictionaut</a></i></div>

I am lost.  Gioia is establishment. My agreement to review Side/Berry's <i>Outside Voices</i> came  before Berry's essay and companion responses appeared, that were  met mostly  with quiet. It occurred to me, as a reader, that the essay  itself is quiet. Now  it seems Side/Berry are closer to naming names  than Berry does in the original  essay and as Perloff does (to my  content) in her response. I am not a  self-identifying poet and not a  poeticist. Argotist has issued my ebooks. Does  that position my name or  my writing against the avant garde poets and  poeticists who Side/Berry  say are to blame and for what? Prosetics is my term I  put to use in  2001. Poets who formed the New Narrative in the 70s include   writers/poets whose work I value a lot, yet they are in a type of  poetics group  surrounding narrative that seems to include writers/poets  other than or unlike  me. My idea of prosetics, since it turned out I  was alone in it, is in practice  and not a theory.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">New  Narrative I think is Acker,  though it joined her more than she it [and]  it seems she was friendly to it, and  Kevin Killian, Dodie Bellamy,  Eileen Myles?, and others, poets and poeticists,  included in Gail  Scott's edited essay collection called <i>Biting the Error:  Writers Explore Narrative</i>, published by Coach House in 2004, based on the  archives of <i>Narrativity</i>,  where I had posted a call for essays on prosetics in  2001, that went  unanswered except by a graduate student studying fiction at  Naropa.  Mark Wallace had asked to co-edit, but the prosetics essay anthology I   had envisioned stalled.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">Later  I started a movement to define  experimental fiction called W?H?A?T,  and the two men I invited in an email to  join did not reply, and I did  not follow up. The blog post I titled <a href="http://annbogle.blogspot.com/2012/09/what.html">W?H?A?T</a> is  based on that email  and [was] shielded from view at <i>Ana Verse</i>. It is not a  manifesto  but asks whether experimental fiction must include territory besides   "nonlinear marginalized sex writing," as described in many reviews   online of <i>Biting the Error</i>, reviews that turned out to be perhaps  sales-sexy  but incomplete in describing the book. W?H?A?T with its pi  signs denotes the  way the inquiry felt and follows in strategy those  inventors in language I  estimate highly. The Buffalo &amp;Now had no  panel on fiction. Eudora Welty as  innovative writer I wanted to place  first in my volume. It's on the notecard in  "Hoss Men" in my ebook  Jeffrey Side pub'd at Argotist in '10.  Belladonna had a conference in  NY in '09 including 100 participants and turned  down "Hoss Men" for  inclusion, saying that it had sparked lively  discussion (in email? in  person?) on the panel, who decided that I (Ann Bogle)  didn't know what  the essay was about. I wrote it in New York in '08 and moved  in '09 to  my birthplace in Minnesota. Ben Marcus wrote about experimental  fiction  in <i>Harper's</i> in 2005.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">July 24, 2012</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">Appears at <i>Fictionaut: </i></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">7 favs</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">205 views<br />55 comments<br />  525 words<br />&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="commentbody">All rights reserved.</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

I was between a size 8 and 10.&nbsp; I  ordered  both ($795 full price, no fur or leather trim) and returned  both to   Nordstrom  at MOA.&nbsp; The wool is nice, but the cut ran short in  the waist on me and   felt a  little baggy at the small of the back,  regardless of size.&nbsp; I am   surprised  by the prices of wool coats  (suddenly, this year?), quite high.&nbsp; [My   Nina Ricci pretty brown  Merino wool original   car-length coat with sheared beaver collar cost  $450 on sale from $900 at   Lord &amp; Taylor in Houston in 1995.&nbsp; My  L&amp;T charge card survived the b'cy in 1997 with a zero balance but  expired without a L&amp;T store here.&nbsp; Lisa Pottratz's mother  illustrated fashion for L&amp;T from home in the '70s.&nbsp; There is more to  say about fertility, naming, and diabetes.]&nbsp; I am so  glad I kept the  charcoal wool UGG coat (shearling collar), $385 on sale [November 2012],  with its great  quality and fit.&nbsp; I guess manufacturers want a lot for   fox fur trim suddenly, too?&nbsp; I bought two thick cotton knit hats last  year at Hoigaard's  with little fox tufts&nbsp;at the tips: about $49 each.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">How  is it going?&nbsp;

I did not ask  Kelly for a whole or partial refund for the treatment application of  November 21, 2012.&nbsp; I saw her   a week ago, the second time I went to    the salon one full hour late for a consultation.&nbsp; She had told me on the  phone she had never heard of a Keratin beehive.&nbsp; [She said a change in  medication might cause the hair to knot.&nbsp; I ran out of coffee early in  January and didn't drink coffee, except one cup, for several weeks.&nbsp; I  also lost weight, not dieting, upon leaving my long-term service  companionship.&nbsp; That wall to the East formed of iron along the CST  line.]&nbsp; Only I, and to a lesser extent, Ned, know the exact details of  what I did with my hair, shampoo, conditioner, water, diet, geographical  location(s),  social circumstances, medication(s), coffee, beer, glass  or two of wine at Christmas,  etc.,&nbsp;that took place then.&nbsp; Medical  records kept by the psychiatrist (M.D. by definition) and pharmacist  could establish a  detail or two as well.&nbsp; Let's assume&nbsp;that my stable  regimen did not go to my hair <i>at the exact moment</i> a beehive  hairdo started to  form.&nbsp; I think Keith may have claimed to somebody or  other  at Metropolis [not to me (objective form of the pronoun required  there)] that I had not  washed my hair in seven weeks, not true if so.&nbsp; I  washed it  every week and a half-to-twelve days&nbsp;(as usual) and brushed it every day.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I  may try to  write an essay about the Keratin experience&nbsp;[including a  passage about the  white woman (prostitute,&nbsp;Jeff Hansen said) whom he  and I saw at Red Dragon  in Minneapolis in 2011, whose "bun" stood about  sixteen inches or so above her head.&nbsp; I would not have known then how  she might have achieved  "that look," but I was impressed.&nbsp; A physical   fight with other ethnically-divided women ensued indoors and may have  escalated  outside, away from my witness]<i>. </i>I have no photo of my  beehive (six  inches at its tallest, measured from the top and back of  my head).&nbsp; I felt  there was no way for me to get a photo of what&nbsp;the  bun <i>felt</i> like to  the touch—a permanent bun I could neaten with  clips.&nbsp; Worn "down," it looked ragged (damaged color and  texture,  both).&nbsp; Fully written, it might be a 3,000-word story of  hair  sacrifice.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">I tried but could not  get a good shot of my hair as it looks today (February 9, 2013).&nbsp; I look  fine in the mirror and  window reflection and haggard in digital  Blackberry  shots.&nbsp; Richard Avedon has been quoted as having said or  written,  "The camera doesn't lie."&nbsp; It Mayberry R.F.D. that Tina Brown lies,  however, since evidence that Avedon said or wrote that line, printed in <i>The  New Yorker</i>,  alongside a photo of him some year before he died in 2004, is  now not  easy or impossible to locate via Google.&nbsp; My photogeneity is  uneven in  digital and film photography, both.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">More a little later, hope your February is  melting slowly.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Love, Ann</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">P.S.

Central Standard Time, and I know, by personal experience, that she checks her email rather infrequently.&nbsp; Since today may be the only day I feel likely to fuss over this piece of writing, I called her, and she said, "Sure, honey."&nbsp; I feel concerned by the charge of "self-plagiarism" leveled at Jonah Lehrer, a professional writer and journalist, by (named?) members in and of the mainstream press. For my purposes, I have practiced and believed that stating a dual-context (without identifying my email recipients by name) might be enough, and, to note, I do not expect writing or plagiarism, including of oneself, to be paid.]</span></span></div></div>

justify;"><i>1590s, "sanctimonious person, religious hypocrite," from French <span class="foreign">bigot</span> (12c.), of unknown origin. Earliest French use of the word is as the  name of a people apparently in southern Gaul, which led to the  now-doubtful, on phonetic grounds, theory that the word comes from <span class="foreign">Visigothus</span>.  The typical use in Old French seems to have been as a derogatory  nickname for Normans, the old theory (not universally accepted) being  that it springs from their frequent use of the Germanic oath <span class="foreign">bi God</span>.  But OED dismisses in a three-exclamation-mark fury one fanciful version  of the "by god" theory as "absurdly incongruous with facts." At the  end, not much is left standing except Spanish <span class="foreign">bigote</span> "mustache," which also has been proposed but not explained, and the  chief virtue of which as a source seems to be there is no evidence for  or against it. <br /><br />In support of the "by God" theory, as a surname <span class="foreign">Bigott</span>, <span class="foreign">Bygott</span> are attested in Normandy and in England from the 11c., and French name  etymology sources (e.g. Dauzat) explain it as a derogatory name applied  by the French to the Normans and representing "by god." The English were  known as <span class="foreign">goddamns</span> 200 years later in Joan of Arc's France, and during World War I Americans serving in France were said to be known as <span class="foreign">les sommobiches</span> (see also <a class="crossreference" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=son%20of%20a%20bitch&amp;allowed_in_frame=0">son of a bitch</a>). But the sense development in <span class="foreign">bigot</span> is difficult to explain. According to Donkin, the modern use first  appears in French 16c. This and the earliest English sense, "religious  hypocrite," especially a female one, might have been influenced by <a class="crossreference" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beguine&amp;allowed_in_frame=0">beguine</a> and the words that cluster around it. Sense extended 1680s to other than religious opinions.</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>Online Oxford English Dictionary</i>:<i>&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/18890?p=emailAAScdPm9BJKhA&amp;d=18890">http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/18890?p=emailAAScdPm9BJKhA&amp;d=18890</a></div>

Do you hear someone  like me while driving? Furry phantom,  face it, FUZZ. _Silo_ is the word  I'll R.I.P. applying. I never address  another, as near as possible, a  cardinal lesbian sign of respect. Addressing  one other, to the nearby  side, rings, as in this crazy poem.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="usercontent"><span>To  Katha Pollitt: My neighbor is  brooding. Brood is the word. Yet she may  be without child, as things stand.  Pronouns are going out of fashion,  yet I know from routine linguistics, that  pronouns were the decision of  our language in favor of inflected gender,  masculine, feminine, neuter  in its early roots. <i>Thing</i> in Old English  _Niedersachsen_ is a phenomenal word. In your earlier writings, you were the  best voi</span></span><span class="textexposedshow"><span>ce  for choice. A year  ago, my neighbor was a sexy graduate student in  fashion design, sounds perhaps  shabby, yet if it is, then we in the  Middle West are all shabby. That girl's  father graduated from high  school with Bob Dylan in Hibbing, not entitling her to a  child. What  might? Are you, is Margaret Atwood, the voice for wandering into   motherhood, awares? No. </span></span><span class="textexposedshow">Christa Forster <span>is at her weblog, <i>Texta</i>. Not that she is <i>gegen</i> Choice.  <i>Danke sehr. Einmal.</i>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="textexposedshow"><span>To Bill Yarrow: </span></span><span>A   cataclysm, a swivel. All praise due, delivered. Orchiectomy,  Orchestra, root  cellar. Would the men and why-would-the-women thinking  of Orch pirate the $45  M, misteer the renovation, the lobby, dismiss  the musicians?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To  Forum  concerning Story ("Mr. Kunitz, Mr. Lowell, Mrs. Craig"): If this story  does  not rise to 45 faves on Fictionaut, I shall not leave Fictionaut. I  feel that  the Lady, yet alive, who wishes she were us, needs to keep  the further higher,  fave location. Her story, “Church Cancels Cow,”  that I read in the middle of  Fri-Sat night, caught me laughing  sincerely, guttural laughter, as if dying  were worth these narrow lines  (of the story she authored). The end canceled  cows and churches. Until  I bought a sack of <i>vinho verde</i> two days later, but I  was canceled already, no matter. Sudden stop, end stop, hockey stop, hit the  boards, cemetery, running.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To  Christa Forster to Charlie Scott re: James Franco's <i>As I Lay Dying</i>:  Ever since Etgar Keret's reading and spontaneous  occurrence in  delivered story, that I anticipated for months, if not weeks, at  the  Saint Louis Park JCC, I threaten to jump out the first-story window if I   have found disfavor with something, not that he even suggested doing  or suggesting that. Each time  I threaten it, I decide against it, in  favor of not curving the well-formed  mosquito screen.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>At  NBD  re: Liz Rosenberg's essay about her childhood depressions: I  enjoyed working as  editorial assistant under Liz Rosenberg, editor, at <i>MSS.</i>, the literary journal  started by John Gardner, Rosenberg's once-husband.<span>&nbsp; </span>It  distresses those of us denied full-time  and even part-time employment  in our field, despite our full and even covetable  credentials, to read  that salaried English teacher/writers, never not salaried,  are claiming  their heritages as the mentally afflicted, as if their mental   afflictions now account for a type of genius that during school days  could only  have served to disqualify them, and so were denied or hidden  or in fact not  felt in the privileged and protected environments they  occupied.<span>&nbsp; </span><i>Laws of Gravity</i> as a title concerns me,  given  a distinct echo to my own unpublished, unprotected, and  pioneering work at  University of Houston in the very early 1990s.<span>&nbsp;  </span>Though  I am certainly glad, in a Scottish-writerly sense of that word,  an  inborn, unshakeable thoughtfulness on my part, to see that Rosenberg is   writing and publishing fiction after a long hiatus.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gifted and talented is or is not  disabled?<span>&nbsp; </span>I'll be waiting to hear.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To  Sharon Mesmer at Fb re: literature as self-help in <i>Daily Mail Online</i>: Tolstoy's  <i>War and Peace</i>,  early pages, Constance Garnett, translator, contains a  description of  feminine beauty to serve as a bar for beauty, a physical measure  to  hold in mind in preparing for the Beauty Bar Exam, higher than that  found in  almost any snap photography. The Flarf panel at AWP Denver  uplifted my spirits,  in part because the panelists, as we once noted  about diagnosed bipolars in an  article cited in our group, attended  mainly by displaced liberal lawyers with  farm and ethical law  backgrounds: presented as SNAPPY DRESSERS.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To   Susan Lewis, managing editor, et al. at MadHat group at Fb: Literary  journal  conquistadoros (anti-socialist?) are thriving and keeping  internal  communication to a barest minimum. I realized that I had  earned in literary  caregiving .0140 per academic subpoint per hour,  compared to $1 per academic  subpoint per hour as earned by a  high-school D-average student working in the  technical field in 1998.  $1 per academic subpoint per hour in my case would  amount to an annual  regular full-time salary of $1,780.000.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>At<i> LA  Review of Books</i>, Andrew Scull: http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=1677.<span>&nbsp; </span>The  history of these men's, including the  reviewer's, careers in  dominating understanding of psychiatry, though admirably  well-woven  here, is not of interest, I hope, to anyone. It is doubtful that   Sigmund Freud is “a fraud”; it seems to have been needless to take a  single  step further, for any of us, in reading. Freud in German, as  Frank Kermode  wrote in <i>The New York Times</i> and reprinted in a  later collection of essays, may  very well be (Mayberry R.F.D.) better, a  wildly hopeful possibility for further  rehistoricizing the social  science of narrative classification of imaginary  human categories. As a  non-expert, I might certainly be more interested in a  book about The  Test, why there is none and has been none for physiological  illnesses  treatable by psychotropic medications, the development of which has   been markedly profitable for certain researchers and scientists. A book  about  how Big Pharma finances the humanities might also appeal to my  pedestrian  sensibilities. A perfect book about the long psychiatric  study of elite  creative writers, rather than of fine arts painters,  musical composers,  classical and modern dancers, art dealers, or rock  ‘n roll musicians is one I  might most like to read. I hope that Johns  Hopkins, the best of the writing  schools, medical schools, and  university publishing houses can one day publish  it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spelling genie post-suggested  Kermmode, captcha.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Re: Chris  Hedges at <i>Truthdig</i>: </span><span>Thanks,   Borg, dined with apparently very wealthy attorney and his  career-active woman  spouse.&nbsp; I felt about him that he was very probably  a phenomenal  storyteller.&nbsp; I liked her as well, in that I typically  like people.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Still, I wonder how or why it is  that to find out what a law is might cost a small fortune or net one.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Love,  Borga, looking forward to  receiving one of my new grammars, not new,  yet new to me.&nbsp; The book I  bought about prepositions in English will  serve as a great guide.&nbsp; Seth  Lindstromberg is the author.&nbsp; Johns  Benjamins Publishing.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Alexander Cockburn would not tolerate  Chris Hedges' hallucinations well, nor do  I.&nbsp; For one thing, poverty is  not an ill, experienced properly.&nbsp; If  AP writers' loss of professional  privacy is his concern here, then he might  have earned a stripe by  breaking the story.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>May  22 to May 29, 2013</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Jeff,   is the bookstore yet possible? June 29, Saturday. Keep me notified.  The only  good woman's suit in years was body paint, Demi Moore covers.  This year I mostly  abstain from shopping. The year I shopped suits in  earnest, nothing available,  so I wore a “boyfriend jacket” and black  jeans though they were only so-so. Now  I have black jeans I like better  that were snug now loose. Disincluded from the  disability poetics  anthology, that grew out of that AWP panel, not due to my  lousy  approximation of a good women's suit, skirt OR pants, but due to my   creative response to disability itself, as if the panel TEAM had not  been  notified, though I had processed it in emails, that creative  response could be  possible. I am still mystified that, in conversation,  I could understand every  word Jennifer Bartlett spoke, though I could  not understand a single word a  different woman in a literature seminar  spoke, who did most of the speaking  that semester from her position at  the end of the seminar table, opposite our  kind professor, where the  woman's wheelchair most naturally fit. I can never  forget my gratitude  in reading Jennifer Bartlett's essay at <i>Delirious Hem</i>,  round 2  fourth wave feminist poetics. Nor fall off in appreciating her poetry.   Intellectual is one of three types of disability listed at the  government  disability employment website. Physical is another type. The  middle type is  either mental or emotional, word I have not remembered.  Intellectual is also a  status, conferred sparingly. Disability is in  not seeking advantage? Disability  is in not seizing advantage?  Disability is distractibility? Empathy best routed  to characters, as I  had hoped and thought possible at 19. Shaped blouses that  conform to my  lines, four hand-spans from the toe to center crotch, four more  from  there to the nose.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To   Gloria Garfunkel at Fictionaut, Butterfly Writer piece, May 26, 2013:  There was  a poet I met in the late 80s in Binghamton named Jerome  Washington.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had served a prison sentence for killing a  man in a bar fight perhaps in the 60s.<span>&nbsp;  </span>While  he was in prison, not as Marcus suggests, for no reason other than   writing, and here in the U.S. not abroad, he wrote poetry and arranged  from his  position there to have not only his but other prison poets'  writings  published.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, he fostered ...  if that is the word ... legislation that went through and passed as law called  Right to Write.<span>&nbsp; </span>After  he visited  Binghamton and gave a poetry reading, he flew to Huntsville  in Texas to meet  with a man on death row who had refused to meet with  lawyers and would only  meet with Jerome Washington.<span>&nbsp; </span>From there,  Jerome Washington flew to Boulder to teach a course at Naropa.<span>&nbsp; </span>Years later, I remembered Jerome Washington  and visited Google to locate him.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had  died by then at the age of 64 at his mother's house.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a substantial Wikipedia entry about  his work and in particular about Right to Write.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some time later, I looked for the entry  again, and it was not there.<span>&nbsp; </span>Another   website carried some of the same information about him, as if it had  been  rescued, yet the website was less official, more low budget, one  might say,  more seemingly temporary, though the Wikipedia entry had  certainly been  temporary.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though I have met many other   writers and poets who have been through Naropa, I have not heard anyone  mention  or seen in ephemeral writing on the Internet or in lists of  African American literati  his name or work.<span>&nbsp; </span>The comment I left at  Gloria's posting from yesterday I ought to have saved for my own file but  forgot to do so.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now it seems to have  been removed if not deleted from the website, perhaps by Gloria.<span>&nbsp; </span>I'll be in the habit more often of  self-saving comments.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>May  31, 2013, to Chris Okum at “Volonte” at Fictionaut: What is to enjoy?<span>&nbsp; </span>The beginning about use of Vicky's name,  which is what I wanted it to say, won my interest instantly.<span>&nbsp; </span>I  can use her name on Mondays, Tuesdays, and  Fridays, my misreading, one  that would lead to a very different story, one  about kidglove damage  by spies inf(t)ernal.<span>&nbsp;  </span>The story it actually is, emanating  from use of Vicky's _house_, gets  pretty violent in its projections,  hers (the female persona narrator's), of his  behavioral suspicions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pretty  much “yuck”  where it follows, but I suppose “yuck” is where it often  does follow, why there  are so many “courts” and split families and  decisions and why marriage is  boss.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, for me, not a  pleasant story  to read, and yet worthy of a telling if I remember it as  fiction about things  American (it seems American) that I dislike.<span>&nbsp;  </span>The  word cuckold stayed on my mind for a long time after I almost titled  a  long short story “The Cuckold” and the story had no cuckold, so it  would have  framed a question had I titled it that.<span>&nbsp;  </span>Here cuckold is not in the title but pressed in the book like a flower  to dry.<span>&nbsp; </span>It  caused me to think of men and  their divorce arrangements and even of  women who played their hand and of  whether any of those men had turned  up in short story news or elsewhere, in  cafes, as cuckolds and I  decided that no, those men had not.<span>&nbsp; </span>The woman I thought of in particular who had  played her hand got very rich in the process.<span>&nbsp;  </span>The  story at hand, by Chris Okum, though presumably not about rich  people,  with its word “cuckold” in it, raised a new question, for me, about   transfer of a husband's inheritance as cuckold hush money.<span>&nbsp; </span>She,  a salesman's daughter, got his  inheritance after it had had a few  babies that resulted in her being awarded  one or two of them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their five millionses  multiplied until each first five million had had six babies.<span>&nbsp; </span>The  servants in the family earned a  market-rate wage based on their  positions in relation to the permanent wife's,  now remarried,  interpretation of her role, very different from his as or as not  a  cuckold.<span>&nbsp; </span>SAD story! now that I think of it.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>To  Therese Svoboda at Fictionaut, May 31, 2013, about her poem in <i>The New Yorker,  </i>1989,  called "Pink": Marcus gets a finder's fee for finding this poem. See  Marc  Vincenz or Jeff Davis for fee. I watched and admired your  [Svoboda's] AWP reading from  March. Here is probably no place to note  it, but I want to see a march of women  in cities around the U.S.  wearing pink burkas. I want to see out the pink burka  without ourselves  being able to see in one anothers' burkas. Women only. Women only   women. I do not want to carry up under a pink tent burka but rather  under a  private or personal burka or burka of one's own.&nbsp; Pink not as a  cancer color.</span></div>
