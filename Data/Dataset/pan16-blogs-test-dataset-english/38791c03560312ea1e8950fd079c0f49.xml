Featuring comforting tones such as violet, plum, fuchsia, watery blues, grays, - and optimistic yellows and oranges- Leeke has produced investment-quality original landscape paintings on canvas, as well as prints.<br /><br />Professionally trained in a variety of fine art media, Leeke blends the old and new. She views art as a medium for the painter to actively experience and express oneself through creative experimentation. Her art begins, transcends and evolves and that is why her landscape paintings are the hot ticket item in home décor. “Her art will withstand the test of time because it is original and her versatility is unlike anything else on the market. Not only that, her art exudes happiness and is full of optimistic bright colors and that’s what consumers are buying,” said Mike Doran, owner of Fontenay Fine Art, Antiques and Eclectic Interiors in Columbia, South Carolina.<br /><br />Historically working in series, her paintings have embraced a variety of concepts. Previous series include Figure Studies, Ballerinas, Divas, Architecturals, Landscapes, Cityscapes and Abstracts. Her new landscapes complement 2009’s trends and afford you one-stop shopping with an artist whose talent captures multiple styles.<br /><br />Here are a few trends and ideas to keep you ahead of the game when selling her art:<br /><br />· DIYers. A continuing - and growing- need is for DIYers (Do It Your-selfers) to renovate their homes for entertainment purposes during tough economic times. They have a strong sense of fulfillment in selecting - and owning - unique design elements. This means we will see continued buying from empty-nesters who want to spruce up their new homes as well as urban professionals who want investment-quality wall art. They desire to improve their kitchens, halls, boudoirs and dining rooms...themselves.<br /><br />· Home Staging. Anticipating improvement in the residential lending sector, consumers prepare to compete strongly when listing their existing home in a market flooded with foreclosed and long-listed properties. Some homeowners, builders and real estate agents are buying art for the walls, and rugs, followed by a few simply placed pieces of furniture in an effort to add value to their once vacant property and sell the house more quickly.<br /><br />· Going Green? More than a just a trend, expect a demand for more botanicals and organics associated with landscapes, such as water, earth, and bright plant inspirations.<br /><br />· Punch it Up. “Punch” color, strategically placed through art, can distinguish an otherwise mundane environment – and increase the perceived value. Leeke’s art adds distinctive punctuation and cohesion to a room when paired with subtle background in wall color.<br /><br />· A Touch of the Exotic. Also complementing home décor this year are items that are exotic with influences from India and the Orient. Rich purples, reds, oranges and yellows serve as the punch for walls, sofas and tabletops. Leeke’s new landscapes work beautifully with both Contemporary and Eastern-inspired design palettes.<br /><br />“Art is the one thing that can change the entire look of a room dramatically, because it is a personal decision” says Todd Collins, owner of House Brand Furniture. He goes on to compliment Leeke for works that are “vibrant with color” and employ “great use of material.”<br /><br />Collectors as far as way as California, New York and Paris agree.<br /><br />Innovative products at Fine Art By Alicia Leeke (F.A.B.A. Gallery) include original works on canvas and paper, fine art giclees (framed and unframed), greeting cards and mouse pads. Also available are monotypes, commissions and works on paper and special sketches of buildings and homes.<br /><br />Examples of her work and experience can be viewed at <a href="http://www.alicialeeke.com/">http://www.alicialeeke.com/</a>.</div>

The new site segments her work into four categories and allows viewers to preview new works easier.<br /><br />“The new design gives my patrons a wider selection of works to choose from than what was previously available, and segments the work into Landscapes, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Cityscapes</span>, and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Monotypes</span> plus a special Prints and Cards section,” says <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Leeke</span>.<br /><br />All of the images found on the site are available as signed, limited-edition prints. Select greeting cards and her most popular pints are also available on the greeting card and print page.<br /><br />In January 2009, she released her new “Abstract Landscape” series with rave reviews in the marketplace. She is currently working on a new series of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Cityscapes</span> for launch mid-year.<br /><br />Patrons are drawn to her robust use of color and gentle distortions of linear perspective and comment on the positive visual response that is evoked when viewing her paintings.<br /><br /><strong>About Alicia <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Leeke</span></strong><br /><br />Alicia <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Leeke</span> started her artistic studies at Columbia College under Steven <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Nevitt</span>. During her sophomore year she vacationed in Paris and visited the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Louve</span>, where she fell in love with impressionism and the work of noted artists: Mondrian, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Lautrec</span>, Degas, Manet, Monet, Renoir and later, Utrillo. She also visited her most inspiring spot in France, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">Montmarte</span>.<br /><br />She later developed an interest in the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">Fauves</span> and their use of intense black lines which became the model for her post-impressionistic style. While <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">Leeke</span> prefers to paint landscapes and quaint street scenes she also strives to capture the essence of every-day events, converting ordinary scenes into lively images.<br /><br />Complementing each painting is a robust combination of dry brush painting techniques to create texture. She manipulates acrylics to capture the thick rich texture of oils and mixes a palette full of rich reds, vibrant oranges, shocking blues and sharp white accents.<br /><br />You may contact Alicia about her paintings by calling (803) 429-5456 (Studio at Edinburgh) or via email at <a href="mailto:info@alicialeeke.com">info@alicialeeke.com</a>.

Owner, Mark Plessinger is a catalyst for the arts, and the momentum for the shows have come full circle since his first show which opened with Leeke’s work over a year ago.<br /><br />The two first came together in early Spring of 2008 to discuss ways to draw traffic to Frame of Mind and integrate art into business. She shared with him the names of other artists around town for future shows which later exploded into other networking ventures between Frame of Mind and The Columbia Museum of Art, The White Mule and most recently Gotham Bagel.<br /><br />"For centuries artists have been coming together. Most notably in America at the Algonqun Hotel in New York City where some the great literary giants such as Gertrude Stein, Maya Angelou, William Faulkner, as well as a plethora of cabaret singers and theatrical entertainers met on a regular basis, said Leeke.” But that hasn’t been the case for the most part in Columbia until now. “It’s important to the area to have businesses like Frame of Mind build a networking bridge among companies, performing arts organizations and artists in the community, and I am seeing a lot more people recognizing the value and impact the arts have on a community -- especially in terms of quality of life and economic growth,” adds Leeke, noting that a more diverse art scene is shifting to Main Street and developing around the Museum and Nickelodeon Theater’s new home.<br /><br />The theme for the show, entitled “Adventures in Wonderland” showcase newly released landscapes awash with color and movement plus a few extra surprises Leeke plans to unveil during the event. This new body of work focuses on the impact color and abstraction has on landscape painting. The artists' love of the coast extends back into early childhood where family vacations were spent exploring the woods, dunes and tides of South Carolina’s coast.<br /><br />Other festivities for the evening include a contemporary dance sampling by the Wideman Davis Dance Company, a sneak preview by NiA Company, a theatrical company housed within Trustus Theatre who will be previewing their new play, and guest appearances by Belly Dancer Natalie Brown from Delirium Tribal and local Magician and professional entertainer, John Tudor.<br /><br />Frame of Mind is open Tuesday through Saturday 10 am to 5 pm and is located at 1510 Main Street in Columbia, South Carolina. Other works may also be seen at the Gallery at Nonnah’s in the Vista, Tombo Grille and House Brand Furniture.<br /><br />You may contact Alicia about her paintings by calling (803) 429-5456, 888-429-5456, via email at <a href="mailto:leekeka@hotmail.com">leekeka@hotmail.com</a> or by visiting her website at <a href="http://www.alicialeeke.com/">http://www.alicialeeke.com/</a>.

Each item on display was made by hand, one piece at a time, and every artist represented was in attendance. Visitors supported the independent artist community with purchases of unique art gifts for Christmas. An alternative to reproductions and retail this show was the ideal place to find a wide range of art and fashion for family and friends. Media and categories included: ceramics, children's gifts, clothing, fashion, accessories, fiber art, furniture, glass, gourmet, holiday, jewelry, metal, mixed media, painting, photography, sculpture, and wood.

The expressive leather work of John Flemming includes belts and purses, bags and masks.</strong> The masks are the colorful and astounding element that stopped many shoppers at this year’s One of a Kind. Featuring hand shaped, pierced and dyed leather, these masks have been appreciated by Cirque du Soliel, and been part of costumes in a variety of theater and films.<br /><br /><strong>Christopher Mosey,at front Tidepools, blown glass, at left rear and right rear, geodes, crushed and molten glass, at center, poured resin, acrylic, and inlaid gold on burnished and torched wood panels.</strong> Working with crushed and molten glass, sculptor Christopher Mosey crafts “geodes, thermal bowls, and tidal pools,” inspired by the forms and intricacies of nature.<br /><br /><strong>Bozenna and Lukasz Bogucki of B'os Art, industrial stainless steel mesh of varying thread counts with torch detail.</strong> With industrial grade stainless steel mesh of exceedingly finely woven construction, Bozenna and Lukasz Bogucki craft silky purses decorated with captured feathers, leaves and torched iridescent designs.<br /><br /><strong>Paul Pearson, hand cut and forged stainless steel, teeth, fossilized shell, precious stones, leather belts. </strong>The handsome and sturdy belt buckles of Paul Pearson involve a complex process of mosaic, found and crafted materials.

If reincarnation exists, I was certainly French in a former life for my love of the countryside, buildings and food.<br /><br />This painting, entitled Tuscan Villa, was created in April 2005 and is in my personal art collection; however, prints are available on my website at (www.alicialeeke.com). It was inspired by the Senanqu Abbey in Provence, France, but with my own personal twist.<br /><br />Creative license played a major role in the creation of this painting. Up until 2008, I painted very little with grey as a major component in my compositions (I think to date only three so far and mostly as color field studies for landscapes). As a matter of fact, I find grey to be the drabbest color in the color spectrum and try to eliminate it from all paintings where possible (Until the painting of Stockholm and Five O’clock Shadows in 2009). In real life, this Abbey is very brown / grey with beautiful contrasting fields of lavender. <br /><br />But due to my dislike of grey at that time, and my love of harvest gold, I turned this painting into a tropical paradise making the building a creamy gold with a red Spanish-style shingle roof and lush tropical lime-green trees and blue sky. While beautiful, the lavender fields were replaced with lush crops in varying shades of green dotted with hints of red, gold and a tinge of lavender.<br /><br />This is truly a painting I painted for myself! I love the distorted lines and lack of perfection in perspective. In fact, I believe freedom to create without worry of judgment is what sets my Cityscape paintings apart from other artists. <br /><br />The two abstract shapes in the foreground are actually people harvesting lavender. I liked the figures so much as they were unfinished; I decided not to clothe them.<br /><br />In May 2008, I went on a Spiritual retreat in Star, North Carolina with Gary Spivey and met some incredibly interesting people. Later, I was commissioned by a fellow guest to paint a similar version of this piece. This commission is much larger than my 16 x 20 original at 30 x 40 in size, and after a few conversations, the painting is taking an additional direction and turning into a Montresorri School. The requestor asked for stained glass windows to be added signifying her love of children. Ironically, I don’t believe she knew the original piece was of an Abbey. <br /><br />This is one of the few pieces in my body of work that I created about three open-edition, gallery-wrapped giclees. At this printing, I am not sure if I will do any additional open editions of any of my paintings because I personally prefer signed and numbered limited-editions.<br /><br />Signed and numbered giclee prints of Tuscan Villa are available for $250 framed and matted, or $80 unframed. The current edition has 250 prints total with some still available as of this posting. The two open edition prints are available at investor prices and will be customized for the purchaser for provenance.

Additionally, as events arise where I'm showcasing new work, I'll include that too.<br /><br />The first work that is being highlighted is called "Nonnah's" and is very popular around the United States especially after customers hear the story behind it. I'm always glad to hear of other stories about the word Nonnah's which I have learned over the years from my customers during shows, so please share any you might have.<br /><br />Nonnah's was one of the very first pieces created when I started painting in 2005. The original is in my personal collection and I sell prints of this piece at the Gallery at Nonnah's in Columbia or on my website (<a href="http://www.alicialeeke.com/">http://www.alicialeeke.com/</a>).<br /><br />Nonnah's is a local establishment in Columbia, South Carolina on Gervais Street. On one side is a restaurant that serves lunch and dinner weekly and on the other is separate Fine Art Gallery with about eight artists. I was included in one of their first shows in 2005 and later became a resident artist in 2008. Just before the opening night of Artista Vista, the state newspaper ran a photo of my mother and our friend Vasa walking down Gervais Street on the way to my first show there which was the inspiration for this painting. I later went back and photographed that building from several angles and painted three different versions (one of which was a commissioned painting.)<br /><br />The original piece was named in French: MERE ET VASA AUX LIMIERE DE VISTA. However, I later simplified the name to just "NONNAH'S" to reflect the name in the painting and make it easier for customers to understand and give greater meaning to local residents and patrons.<br /><br />The owner of Nonnah's, Maggy Groff, named her establishment after her daughter Shannon. So, Nonnah's spelled backwards is Shannon. Ironically, after showing the painting and subsequent giclees, my customers began to share with me that Nonnah's also means grandmother in Greek and Italian. Aside from the fact that the painting gives Columbia a "French" feel with this painting, it is also extremely popular elsewhere because of the stories behind the painting and the fact that customers just really like the piece and old world feel of it. I always like to tell the story that if Columbia were Paris (as much of the inspiration for my work is) this is what it would look like.<br /><br />Gervais Street in Columbia is a straight street, but my creative license has it with a curve to add interest.<br /><br />Signed and numbered giclee prints of Nonnah's are available for $250 framed and matted or $80 unframed. The current edition has 250 prints total with some still available as of this posting.
