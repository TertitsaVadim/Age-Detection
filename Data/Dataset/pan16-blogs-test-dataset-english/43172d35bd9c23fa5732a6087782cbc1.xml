  <p>Compiling info, stats and video of the most discussed Texas OC candidates.</p>
<p>Let's window shop for Offensive Coordinators, shall we?</p>
<p>First, DISCLAIMER: I'm no expert at scouting coaches. For that level of analysis, your best bet is to start&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.barkingcarnival.com/2014/1/7/5285148/the-next-texas-longhorns-offensive-coordinator">here</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm pretty good at Googling things. So I've scanned the nominee list for the 2013 Broyles Award for best coordinator. Forty nominees are selected for this honor every year by coaches, and Broyles Award finalists have a pretty stellar track record, so I figure it's not a bad proxy for "good".</p>
<p>Of the offensive coordinators listed, I removed the coaches who for one reason or another would obviously not be considered. Seven names remained, and those seven names overlap quite a lot with the Longhorn interwebs chatter, so I figure y'all will be interested in learning more about them.</p>
<p>Please note that I'm not necessarily endorsing these guys or even saying that it's possible/smart to go after them. I'm just noting that these are some active OCs who are impressing people right now. If we're going to be hearing about these guys over the next few days, might as well learn more about them, whether you like them or not.</p>
<p>Also note: obviously, there are good candidates that won't be included here. If none of these guys seem good enough, maybe that's a sign to look outside the box. Right?</p>

<p>STATS</p>
<p>I've included the S&P+ stats for the teams each coach has coordinated. For the S&P+ stats graphics:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The years in which the person coordinated or co-coordinated the offense are in gold;</span></li>
<li><span>For each individual tenure I've also included the year prior as reference, in white; and</span></li>
<li><span>The arrows indicate the quartile in which the team ranked that year in the FBS in that category.</span></li>

<p>OBVIOUS UPSIDE</p>
<ul>
<li><span>He's a Big 12 native, having played at OK State and spent most of his coaching career in the conference.</span></li>
<li><span>He's been a recruiting coordinator at both LSU and OK State, so he knows something about recruiting AND recruiting in Texas.</span></li>
<li><span>He's also been an O-line and tight ends coach so he'll serve as an extra pair of eyes on the trenches.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>OBVIOUS DOWNSIDE</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Only one year of experience coordinating (though yes, that year was quite successful).</span></li>

Well, here's his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. </span><span>Malzahn may have only been an FBS head coach for two years, but Lashlee has been learning under Malzahn in some way since 1998 as a QB at Shiloh Christian HS, with only a couple of minor detours at Samford and as a player at Arkansas separating them over the last 15 years.</span> </li>
<li>At the tender age of 30, he might not be in a huge rush to land a head coaching position, and may be well-advised to spend a few years first learning about elite defensive coaching from the likes of Strong. Also an Arkansas native.</li>

<li>Did you lust after Todd Graham for head coach? Um...well, here's his&nbsp;prot&eacute;g&eacute;&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp;Norvell hitched onto Graham's star in Tulsa in 2006 and has been dragged across the country playing an ever-greater role in Graham's offense ever since. </li>
<li>At the tender age of 32, he might not be in a huge rush to land a head coaching position, and may be well-advised to spend a few years first learning about elite defensive coaching from the likes of Strong. Also an Arkansas native.</li>

  <p>What should Charlie Strong be looking for in the next OC at Texas?</p>
<p>The hire at OC is arguably the most important one that a defensive-minded Head Coach makes. The S&C Coach is essential in regards to building a culture and developing players, but difference making recruits often make choices based on fit and opportunity in a particular offensive system.</p>
<p>As Scipio has noted, defensive coaches often tend to have one of two minds regarding the teams' offensive system.</p>
<p>A) They'll choose a coordinator from a system or school that they always feared and hated to defend, or</p>
<p>B) They emphasize on offense that will share their preference for physicality and toughness.</p>
<p>Bob Stoops fits into category A. Terrified of Kentucky's Air Raid system while at Florida, Stoops made it a point to install Leach immediately in Norman and has maintained many of the Air Raid principles through to today.</p>
<p>Will Muschamp is a clear category B who prioritized installing a system that helped him build a physical and well tested D, could impose its will in the run game, and could help him sell recruits on coming to Florida to play in pro-style schemes.</p>
<p>Neither approach is flawed, but the key is for the HC to have a firm vision of what he wants on offense and the willingness to learn how to oversee such an operation. Former coordinators who prefer to have an autonomous department in the hands of a strong coordinator hire are at the mercy of their hires, which will not necessarily be consistent because the Coach hasn't taken the time to master the principles he's after.</p>
<p>At this stage, Bob Stoops and Nick Saban are as thoroughly immersed in what their offenses look like as what their defenses are up to. Consequently, they can consistently develop coaching talent and insure quality control over their offenses. Gary Patterson pays less attention to the offensive side of the ball. If he has a great up and coming coordinator like Justin Fuente, he's in good shape. If he leaves and the replacement is a dud? The Frogs wet the bed right when stepping onto the national stage.</p>
<p>When Strong is choosing his next OC, it'll be important to observe whether he chooses a system or philosophy that he's eager to take ownership of, or if he takes an established hire and then gives them total autonomy until they screw up. It won't necessarily be a bad sign if he hires a very established OC, but it'll be interesting to see how much his hand is in the system over the next few years, particularly if he has to make a 2nd hire.</p>
<p>All that said, what philosophy and identity should Strong be looking to implement at Texas?</p>
<p>From what he ran at Louisville and his limited statements thus far in Austin, I suspect he prefers an up-tempo system, the ability to be wide open (attacking downfield in the passing game), and to be physical at the point of attack.</p>
<p>That's a great start and I believe each of those features would play very well into the resources available here at Texas. Those resources are:</p>
<p>-A state that is producing athletic but extremely well-developed passers and receivers.</p>
<p>-A current roster with powerful and athletic bodies OL, potentially capable of adapting to basically any type of blocking system</p>
<p>-Three QB's on the roster who are solid-to-strong runners but have higher upside as passers</p>
<p>-A dearth of receiving TE's on the roster but an abundance of talented wideouts</p>
<p>-A pair of physical running backs</p>
<p>-A 2014 that will feature some really solid upperclassmen like Espinosa and Shipley but no obvious game breakers unless Daje fits back in or younger players are developed into stars.</p>
<p>Some of the popular names thrown around as potential OC hires for Texas have included the likes of Rhett Lashlee from Auburn and Tom Herman from Ohio St. I'm going to argue that these would not fit either Strong's stated vision for the Texas offense, nor the sum of the resources available at Texas.</p>
<p>Herman began to falter at Iowa St and was rescued by Urban Meyer at Ohio St and handed an experienced crop of extremely talented OL, one of the most dangerous running QB's in the nation, and one of the more versatile and physical RB's in the nation.</p>
<p>Watch an Ohio St game sometime. You'll see them run Zone Read, Power Read, throw a screen, and chuck a downfield pass on play-action. Watch Lashlee's (i.e. Malzahn's) offense at Auburn and you'll see the same thing. Athletic and powerful OL, exceptionally simple passing game, and runs that prominently feature the QB as a runner.</p>
<p>None of the QB's on Texas' roster would thrive if featured in those systems, nor would Texas finally be able to take advantage of talents like <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/37738/andrew-luck">Andrew Luck</a> or RG3 in the future in those offenses. Don't get me wrong, they aren't terrible offenses, but it would be years before they reached their full impact at Texas.</p>
<p>If you think Swoopes would come alive in those systems I'd encourage you to watch the angles of pursuit and effort level of the D at the 2013 spring game on his scrambles, or the his ability to change direction and accelerate in his limited action in the season.</p>
<p>There's the added concern that these coordinators are thriving under Head Coaches who are clearly heavily involved in the offense, much like if you hired Kirby Smart as your HC.</p>
<p>I'm not richly up to date on the various hires available to Strong but I believe that the ideal Texas' system would match some of the following descriptions:</p>
<p>1) A run game built around inside and outside zone that can involve the QB BUT DOES NOT depend on him as a featured runner.</p>
<p>Power is a great run concept, Power-read is basically a Veer play that asks your QB to cut up the grain on an interior running lane. It's not a great concept if you want your QB to be healthy and throwing the ball into downfield windows late in the season.</p>
<p>As it happens, Texas' likely starters on OL next year are proficient in outside zone and it'd make for a strong feature for the 2014 team to hang its hat on. That said, there are different ways to run these Zone concepts. If Strong is serious about being a physical team he won't bring in Noel Mazzone to run a "catch and screen" inside zone call that doesn't look to score vertical displacement.</p>
<p>Those aren't terrible ways to block the run but they don't take advantage of a guy like Estelle or Raulerson who could be taught to lean on and totally exhaust an opponent. I'd prefer we run these schemes more like Alabama than Missouri.</p>
<p>2) A passing game with a limited number of concepts but a large variety of after-snap reads and options.</p>
<p>Passing games are becoming more sophisticated today in how they can give a QB lots of options for attacking multiple defensive looks within a single play call. At a place like Texas, you want to be as simple as possible so that you can focus on accumulating tremendous talent and teaching the players to execute at a high level.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">Think Jimbo Fisher and the FSU offense that just won a title with a redshirt freshman.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">I'd prefer that the route adjustments to coverage reflect a desire to score with the deep ball as frequently in a game as possible, ala the Briles' Bears. If you're good at it, you do it often enough, and you don't care if your victories have scores like 50-30 rather than 30-10, it's an exceptional option for a team likely to have access to the players who can do it.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;">3) Packaged plays and fast tempo</p>
<p>This is the future and you can do it from pro-style looks as well as spread-option systems, you needn't ask your QB to run the ball 10+ times a game, just watch a West Virginia game and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p>Every team with access to elite athletes should rely on quick tempo. You kill teams that don't have depth, you protect your ability to be simple on offense from complicated defensive responses, and you increase the sample size every game in which inferior athletes have to beat your players at execution.</p>
<p>4) The ability to utilize multiple formations</p>
<p>What if Texas' has a crop of exceptional receiving TE's one year and perhaps some versatile fullbacks the next? Briles has great success recruiting cookie-cutter pieces for his offense but it'd be nice if Texas' concepts could be flexible enough to feature a phenomenal TE, an unstoppable slot receiver, an elite tailback, or a dual-threat QB with the formations.</p>
<p>Ideally, you have players that can play multiple positions so you can hammer a defense with different formations and angles at high speed without substituting.</p>
<p>Anyways, these are my thoughts on the direction Strong should and might take at OC, what are y'all thinking? Anyone you'd like to see here?</p>

  <p>A friend met Coach Strong after the press conference in a get-to-know-you session held for some of the external stakeholders and former Texas players. &nbsp;I wanted to share some of his impressions. &nbsp;They made me happy. &nbsp;The bold part is his info, the rest is my babbling.</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<p><b>A few big donors were MIA. &nbsp;The types who never miss anything. &nbsp;Interpret as you will. </b></p>
<p>My opinion? &nbsp;I'll go with a mix of protest over Brown and hurt feelings at not being consulted in (read: directing) the process when it was time for the change. &nbsp;Ironically, many of these guys wanted a stronger hand and more accountability from Bellmont, but part of that means that they have to develop a more normal, healthy and sane relationship with the AD and head coach.</p>
<p>Involving the donors was crucial in the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/115256/mack-brown">Mack Brown</a> era as a clueless Texas administration had utterly alienated them with the end of Akers to McWilliams to Mackovic wander in the desert, but Brown didn't establish proper boundaries while otherwise masterfully building his coalition and Dodds was hands off if the checks aren't bouncing, preferring political triangulation to confrontation. Naturally, big donors began to hold sway in ways that were unhealthy - some in blind support of the Mack personality cult enabled by their unfettered access, others seeking to end Brown's failing program with end-arounds on a somnolent administration.</p>
<p>Patterson, and to a lesser degree, Strong, will be resented for setting boundaries, but once the emotion works its way out, the sharpest big donors will understand the importance of mutual accountability and the need for a healthy correction. &nbsp;We need a middle ground between ignoring our donors and kowtowing to them. &nbsp;And in fairness to the bolder ones, if Bellmont wouldn't impose accountability on the athletics program, they damn sure would try. Have we acted much differently here?</p>
<p><b>Charlie Strong is personable one-on-one and a straight-shooter. &nbsp;Looks you right in the eye and answers your question, whatever it may be. </b></p>
<p>We're not hiring someone to open up a branch of Toastmasters or act as the leading wit in the British House of Commons. &nbsp;I believe he's very effective in small settings, in a living room, and teaching his subject matter on a football field. &nbsp;Welcome to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2012/01/26/the-secret-power-of-introverts/">secret power of introverts.</a></p>
<p>H<b>e asked him about his staff and Strong smiled from ear to ear and said that the resources available&nbsp;to him are "unbelievable." He will put together his "dream staff" built up over three decades of coaching contacts. </b></p>
<p>Frankly, I was concerned about whether Strong got this. &nbsp;I doubt he brings more than 1/3rd of his Louisville guys and retains few of our current staff. &nbsp;From a recruiting standpoint, Strong's reputation in Florida is sterling and he's not going to walk away from that. &nbsp;If he'll throw me a bone with a Southern California coach, it's dream coverage for target rich national recruiting.</p>
<p>Watson remaining as OC will be telling, IMO.</p>
<p><b>Strong is going to meet with all of the Texas staff, figure out who may or may not fit based on availabilities, and then start working the phones (or answering his). &nbsp;Expect a staff within 7-10 days. </b></p>
<p>Already been reported that Bo Davis is going to USC. &nbsp;S&C coach Bennie Wylie has been released.</p>
<p>That's all I've got.</p>

<p>His time in Stillwater wasn't particularly glorious, but he has extensive NFL and college coaching experience at several major programs in addition to serving as Charlie Strong's defensive right hand. &nbsp;It's unclear whether he'll also coach DBs in addition to his DC responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen Vance speak yet, he's quite understated and reserved:</p>

  <p>The Cowboys starting C was lost for the season last week. This could be either really good or really bad for Texas.</p>
<p>Hate to break up the all the Charlie Strong posts on the front page, because it is so nice to read about an actual football coach at this school, but there is a basketball season going on. While Rick Barnes had a good non-conference run this season, conference play will tell the tale. It always does.</p>
<p>After a tough home loss to OU on Saturday, Texas travels to Stillwater for one of the toughest games on the Big 12 schedule. Not many teams are going to get a W out of at OSU this year. However, we might have caught Travis Ford's boys at the right time.</p>
<p>OSU lost their starting C (<a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/124109/michael-cobbins">Michael Cobbins</a>) right before the start of Big 12 season and they are still trying to figure out their new identity. While he was only playing 20 minutes a night, he was their biggest player and best interior defender.</p>
<p>In a close loss at Kansas State on Saturday, Ford went small, adding another guard and shifting everyone on the lineup down a spot. I'm guessing that has to be the plan going forward, because they don't have too many other options off their bench.</p>
<p><b>Starters:</b></p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/124110/markel-brown">Markel Brown</a>: Brown has better numbers than Smart across the board -- FG%, bounds, assists to turnover, steals. He's a super-athletic senior who can ball-hawk, shoot and make plays for teammates. Give him a lane to the rim and he will dunk on your head.</p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/174487/marcus-smart">Marcus Smart</a>: A future lottery pick with incredible size (6'4 225) for a PG, but he's also still a sophomore adding polish to his game. Playing Brown on the ball has allowed Smart to hunt his own shot more this year. At times, it's like he's going out of his way to prove he can shoot 3's.</p>
<p>Brian Williams: An athletic junior wing (6'5 210) with NBA-size and athleticism - another perimeter stopper who can get into his man and turn them over. His offensive game is mostly dunks, putbacks and run-outs. Keep him out of transition and off the glass and he won't hurt you.</p>
<p>LeBryan Nash -- At the college level, Nash probably makes more sense as a small-ball 4. He had 20/6 against Kansas State; he might finally start putting up numbers this season. The scouting report says to make him shoot, but it's hard for bigger guys to stay in front of him.</p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/179011/kamari-murphy">Kamari Murphy</a> -- 6'8 220 combo forward shifted down to the 5 after Cobbins' injury. Of the two, he's the better player -- he rebounds and blocks as a similar level and he can play on the perimeter. The problem is there's no one behind him.</p>
<p><b>Bench:</b></p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/174483/phil-forte">Phil Forte</a> -- The Keiton Paige scholarship recipient for the second straight year. 5'9 white guy who will hoist from anywhere -- deadly in transition. If Ford is feeling devious, he'll stick Forte on <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/174549/javan-felix">Javan Felix</a> and goad him into taking pull-up jumpers.</p>
<p>** It just occurred to me that every team should do that. This is the kind of weakness that can really be exploited in conference play. The level of scouting and game-planning just goes through the roof. An ACC team playing you on a Tuesday ain't got time for all that.</p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/229427/stevie-clark">Stevie Clark</a> -- 5'11 backup PG. You know Clark has talent because of the BS the coaching staff has put up with. He took a pot charge on New Years Day, which means he's been suspended twice this season. You would think he'll be out, but this is OSU.</p>
<p>Marek Soucek -- A 7'0 junior from the Czech Republic whose been wheeled off the bench and pressed into duty as the backup 5. He had 3 fouls in 6 minutes against Kansas State.</p>
<p>After the injuries, Oklahoma State plays like an NCAA version of the Heat. They have one big man and four perimeter players and they can all get out and run. You better control the backboards against these guys and keep them in the half-court.</p>
<p>Pace will be the key for Texas. If Brown, Smart and Williams can speed them up and get the game going up-and-down, it's not going to be pretty, especially at Gallagher-Iba. Texas needs to take care of the ball and pound it inside to the big men.</p>
<p>Getting Murphy into foul trouble would be huge. If he's only playing 20-25 minutes and OSU has LeBryan at the 5, they aren't getting much rim protection or rebounding at the position, let's put it like that. <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-basketball/players/174559/cameron-ridley">Cameron Ridley</a> needs to wear these little guys out.</p>
<p>If Texas can establish Ridley in the low-post, OSU will have to go into zone, which should open up things for shooters on the perimeter. Losing Cobbins definitely makes them more vulnerable. I'm just not sure if we can exploit those vulnerabilities enough.</p>
<p>In a rowdy road game, the key for any young team is to protect the basketball. Barnes might need to use all his timeouts by the middle of the second half. Don't save any for an ATO at the end of the game - keep the crowd out of it as much as possible.</p>
<p>OSU is a -13 point favorite for this game, which seems about right. The game is at 8 on ESPNU.</p>

  <p>Oh, my.  </p>
<p>Break out the Purell and penicillin.</p>
<p>The culture continues to shorten the public humiliation career resuscitation timeline from decades to months in politics and media and Louisville is doing their bit for the sporting world.</p>
<p>It looks like offensive genius and ethical infant <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/players/87277/bobby-petrino" class="sbn-auto-link">Bobby Petrino</a><a href="http://www.cardchronicle.com/2014/1/8/5288854/report-bobby-petrino-expected-to-return-as-louisville-football-coach"> will try to make it happen again at the 'ville</a>. &nbsp;He'll join Rick Pitino to form the creepiest football-basketball tandem in America. &nbsp;I defy any of you to put forth a combo in revenue sports with a superior coaching ability to creep factor. &nbsp;This is a masterful niche to exploit if you truly don't give a damn about appearances and the Moneyball ridge of my reptilian brain swims in appreciation chemicals even as the human being portion of my brain retches uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are also bringing in Charles Haley to head up Human Resources where he'll spearhead his new awareness campaign: LAY DEM NUTZ OUT CARDINALS, SHEEEIT. &nbsp;This according to new school president, Anthony Weiner.</p>
<p>The potential implications for the Longhorns is that, if true, it guarantees little retention of Strong's former staff, whether by Petrino's choice, or because they fear he will embezzle money from them and say weird things to their 16 year old daughters. &nbsp;Will an intensely loyal Strong watch while his buddies pound the pavement looking for jobs when he has several wide open here at Texas?</p>
