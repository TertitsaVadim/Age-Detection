My friends crew made up some real time observations from IRS and witnessed a good number of planets than they have expected !! Cheers to those who were a part of&nbsp; <b style="color: red;">'JO MAP'</b> !! :)</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: inherit; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qDCZ1bT5iy8/TN0779VciaI/AAAAAAAAFSs/2KpGRo9gHqs/s1600/jupiter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qDCZ1bT5iy8/TN0779VciaI/AAAAAAAAFSs/2KpGRo9gHqs/s320/jupiter.jpg" width="320" /></a></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">I started my observation right from my terrace with a good resolution Binoculars.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">(No telescopes :( ).

With the lined up work load i planned to watch 2 movies ~ Social Network and Dead Poets Society. Both are inspiring one's !!<br /><br /><b>Social network</b> ~ about facebook. I have never ever dreamt of such a big story behind tat. And Mark Zuckerberg a big <i>WOW</i> !! How a Harvard grad's transition to the youngest billionaire of world and holds 500 million people to visit his website daily.<br /><br /><b>Dead Poets Society</b> ~ a movie about student and teacher, who inspires and motivates them to go in the path they dream about. It gives a good insight about poems, and how to live a life the way you want.<br />'<i>Carpe diem - seize the day</i>'. A touching story !!<br /><br />The rest i leave it to you to watch and comment. :) <br /><br /><i><span class="indquote_link">~                         I went into the woods because I wanted to live  deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of  life... to put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I came to  die, discover that I had not lived.~</span></i>

We walked through the small ponds to reach the hill spot which was <i>scenic</i> !!&nbsp; i went there only once :(</span></div><div style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">A few ponds had Quick sand too, Creepy &amp; scary insects and snakes were all around the camp site..!!!! :(</span></div><div style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">With the increasing water level and continuous erosion on the sand surface, in 3 days the river point disappeared..!! Finally the sun made its appearance on the last day..!!</span></div><div style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">On the whole the camp gave a real time experience of conducting survey..!!! Those camp moments are cherishable..!! :) :)</span></div></div>

The main success of GH 11 is team work and hard work. The most challenging task was sponsor collection - which was not so easy. Next comes the organization of events and preparation for every events. Thanks to the Good Bunch of Juniors who did a very good job in Organizing each individual event !! :) :) Kudos !!!! :)<br />Next comes the crowd puller ~ call for ambassadors, non technical events, popularizing the event. I guess all our efforts helped us in gathering a huge crowd for GH 11. The struggles and challenges we faced were, last minute refusal of permission for workshop (on the day b4 we managed to get permission somehow :) ) And a few problems in time management.<br /><br /><br /><br />March 17 geared up with workshop on Open source GIS by "<span style="color: red;">KCube</span>" which gave the participants an introduction and hands on about QGIS and GRASS.<br /><br />March 18 the sympo started with the inaugural address. Where we got a green signal for transfoming Geohorizon from National level to International level !!!! :) :) Crack the track, prelims, loads of Informal events made the audience glued to their seats !!! Highlights of day1 was Birla planitorium session (we were lucky enough to catch the supermoon a day earlier !! )<br /><br />March 19 was a jam packed day full of events like magnum opus, grafitti, sultan of survey, survey junkie, treasure 360, mind space, quizes, informals.<br /><br />March 20 Alumini meet which dropped our seniors into their nostalgic college moments !! :)<br /><br />Geohorizon 2011 was a platform which helped everyone of us to mould us and improve our organization &amp; management skills. Pitfalls always help us to make a better tomorrow !! :)<br />I hope to see a much better international Geohorizon 2012 !! :)<br /><br />PS: Comments and Experiences are always welcomed !! :) </div>

Woohhhhaaa !! How does t feel to a little girl who had so much inspiration and admiration towards the Scientist @ ISRO !!! I was jumping in Joy :) :) The oppotunity was given to only 3 in our class... Thank God I was 1 in tat 3 :) :) I could remember that was the first meet of President Kalam with Students. We were asked to prepare questions to ask Kalam. I had some question regarding his experience, why to politics, corruption, etc., And the day came we were asked to report to Vivekanandha Auditorium in Anna University for that Session !! Hard luck.. dint favour me :( I was unable to question him :(<br /><span style="color: red;">Never mind "I met kalam !!!" :) :)</span><br /><br />Aug 13th 2007 ~ Orientation in Anna University&nbsp; at the Same Vivekanandha Auditorium :) I have never thought i would be back to this place as a student of AU...!! Dropped into B.E Geoinformatics by Chance !! I cared more about AU and the majestic 200 year old red building !! Eventhough many people never understands about Geoinformatics, it is fun to explain them about it !!! History marks that AU first started as a Survey School - more or less Geoinformatics dates back to that (officailly it started in 1992 :) )<br /><br />College life started of with the daily hectic travel in 21 G !! Classes were bit scary in the beginning, but later adjusted well.. English classes ~ we become speechless !!! Thursdays made me crazy with the ED classes. Till now I cant draw a straight line straightly !!! And Programming (I thought C was just an alphabet before entering into College as I was a statistics student :) ) Chemistry lab was handled by another terror prof whose angry may blow to Bay of Bengal !! :) :) Anyhow 1st semester in college gave me unforgettable memories and good bunch of friends for life!! :)<br /><br />Time flew by boring theory classes and much mmore boring lab, record works. Surveying in the college ground and roads was fun filled - it enhanced our manipulation skills !! :) :) 3D in photogrammetry lab ~ only a few are blessed with proper binocular vision. I m not one in that. Somehow managed to join the marks which are always floating. :) :) I never understand why we studied ethics, pom, tqm !!!<br /><br />GIS and Image processing were two extremes, GIS was powerpacked !! :) Image processing was just to "Explore the tools actually". Communication and technical seminar jus killed the time !! IVs, Camps, Survey camp added glory to college life !! :)<br /><br />Kurukshetra k! - The battle of Brains and ofcourse Agni and Techofes the Cultural Fests !! :) :) :)<br />And then the department symposiums !! :) :) Mass Bunks, Birthday Bashes, Postponing assessments, taking a take home test, fights, fun, writing assignments in last minute, submiiting records after deadline, being late to a class, etc., etc., :) :)<br /><br />Final year ~ job, projects, mini picnics,&nbsp; farewell !!! :) :)<br /><br />It feels like just yesterday but it is nearly 4 years.. soon marking its end !!!<br />Memorable moments in Anna University - K! '10, Techofes '11, Geohorizon, Survey Camp, IVs, Crazy Fights, bursting in laughter in the middle of class, canteen treats, gurunath chats, hostel life, roaming in and around college, wat not  !!! :) :) Memories live long !!</div>

On a very fine Holiday I was all set with a plan of catching a train @ 6.30 AM. With&nbsp; a notion of starting at 5 and catching a bus from the nearby bus stop, which can help me reach the station in time. I kept an alarm at 5 and went to sleep..!!! And as soon as the alarm rang I woke up with excitement of going home !! After walking a few Steps I met a guard in the road.<br /><br />Guard: Where are you roaming at this time ??<br /><br />Myself: Going to catch a bus by 5.15 !<br /><br /><br />Guard: Why have you started by 3 for catching a bus at 5.15 ??<br />Myself: @#$%!^&amp;*?!!! (After relaxing myself) No the time now is 5 ! <br /><br /><br />Guard: I am sure the time is 3. Better check your watch ?!<br />Myself: No I am damn sure the time is 5. ( Suddenly I felt whether my self and the guard are experiencing Time dilation ?!?!? )<br /><br />(with a doubt i checked my another watch) god !!!! it was 3 AM only !!<br /><br />unable to give a proper response, I managed to escape from the guard's scolding and came back home. Thank God&nbsp; !! At least he helped me not to get struck on the way !<br /><br />The Next two hours went on with a single question in my mind !! Still I am puzzled on how my clock ran 2 hours faster suddenly !!<br /><br />Finally I came to a conclusion - I was 2 hours faster than the rest of the world for few minutes :) :)<br /><br />Here is a note to all : Better check your time thrice or more than that to avoid these kind of Incidents !!! :) :)</div>

Indeed i forgot the existence of my own blog. After reading few blogs I started realizing I do have a blog.. Work keeping me busy makes it hard to sit and write a post. Its time to keep things aside and to pen down few stuffs.<br /><br />Monday is becoming a more of threatening word. While saturday and sunday moves very swiftly. preparing a todo list for a weekend will make a CC to the next weekends todo list too.. piling up the todo list i finally endup doing nothing other than thinking about the weekdays.. I donno how the fear of these weekdays caught me up. Indeed i should stop thinking and fearing tooo much.To relax myself I thought i could search for a few unanswered questions !! Yes I m listing a very few here.. Hope you guys will also have more&nbsp; questions like these......<br /><br />It was a time when I watched Television just for attractive advertisements, which are admired for their creativity( The beautiful hutch dog,zoo zoos, much more) . But these days I could honestly feel those days of better advertising is gone. Here are a few ads which made me think that way...<br /><br />1. One of the popular shampoo brand which tells "enthalamela kaiya vechu sathiyama" solrean... What do you want to convey to the auiduance??? I felt like they are begging us to buy that brand.Why unnecessarily wasting a promise ?? Pls grow up !<br /><br />2.Most of the children health drinks ad... Oh my god..!! One says you can grow 2X faster.. and the other says Sharper, Taller... I just want to ask these people Is growing 2 times faster a normal happening..?? Growing faster isnt abnormal ?? Seriously i m planning to start a research on this. Suggestions appreciated.<br /><br />3.The competition between the Jewllers... with the increase in the price everyday, gold has already became a luxury. Every jeweller claims that the only provide a proper pricing system. Godsake its highly irritating to see each and every jewellers advertise in the same fashion. Better we will start a purathi porattam to stop these ads..!<br /><br />Oops again a weekend with a bunch of to-do list ! Hope so i wil remember my blog and keep updating it :) :) In search of the unanswered questions..!</div>
