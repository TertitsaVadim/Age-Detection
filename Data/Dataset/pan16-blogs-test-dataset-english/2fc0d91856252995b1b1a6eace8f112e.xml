Rochioli, this West Block selection is probably their more known wine in the international community.&nbsp; Once again, one of the best wines I have had.&nbsp; My personal favorite is the East Block.<br /><br /><u>2001 J. Rochioli, West Block, Russian River Valley</u><br />consumed Friday, Nov. 26, 2010, with friends, Retail $120<br /><br />Well first of all, I about had heart attack after cutting the foil off of the bottle.&nbsp; I could see where a little wine had reached the top of the cork usually a sign the wine is corked.&nbsp; Meaning oxygen has gotten into the wine prematurely and basically spoiled it.&nbsp; As I dug into the cork with the wine opener, more problems arose, since the wine had made its way all the way to the top the cork and the fact that it was 9 years old, the cork screw was just shredding the cork, luckily we got enough of it in to where we could wiggle it out of the bottle.&nbsp; The true test came with a little sniff of the wine....... my heart pounding....... expecting it to smell like wet socks (smell typical of a corked wine)....... I was delighted to smell a tight wine ready to open!!&nbsp; Phewwwww!&nbsp; Not only was it the wine that I was worried about but all during Thanksgiving I had been talking up this wine to my girlfriends family and was excited for them to try it so luckily it was good! <br /><br />With older wines (and even high quality younger wines) you should really let the wine sit for at least an hour before enjoying.&nbsp; Since I am impatient and trying to educate myself I jumped right in!&nbsp; The aroma upon opening was subtle, and what to me felt like a Christmas present waiting to be opened.&nbsp; Everything great about the wine was there, however, it was closed off waiting for something to kick in the door.<br /><br />Meet oxygen, after about 30 minutes the wine really hit it's stride, I mean really.&nbsp; It's interesting to taste the wine as it goes through this process.&nbsp; The wine opened up with big bright red fruit, (Russian River Valley at it's finest) bing cherry, raspberry, a little licorice, the wine was pleasantly balanced, and the finish lingered forever.&nbsp; This is why I have fallen in love with wine!<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">******</span>

Chapoutier.&nbsp; A much larger producer with wines from many areas in the Rhone this wine is from a lesser know area, Crozes-Hermitage in the Northern Rhone region where the red wine is made from 100% Syrah.&nbsp; In a very general sense the wines from the Crozes-Hermitage are lesser quality then the wines from Hermitage and Cote-Rotie.&nbsp; Still a place where you can likely find hidden gems.... however, this M. Chapoutier is not one of them.&nbsp; <br /><br /><u>2008 M. Chapoutier, Petite Ruche, Syrah, Crozes-Hermitage</u><br />consumed Saturday, Nov. 20, 2010 with love, Retail $28.00<br /><br />The wine itself was okay and the price was not.&nbsp; I enjoyed the Bernard Latour from the Southern Rhone much more and for $10 dollars less.&nbsp; As I venture deeper and deeper into wine I'm really starting to get a little understanding on pricing.&nbsp; I will elaborate here, these are my own opinions and what I think in this particular case.&nbsp; M. Chapoutier produces wine from basically every appellation in the Rhone.&nbsp; The different labels and wines are quite many.&nbsp; For instance, a 2007 Chapoutier Ermitage le Meal Syrah (Hermitage) can fetch $170 dollar bottle depending on where you are buying it.&nbsp; After some research I found that you can get the wine I had above (Petite Ruche) for around $18, in my opinion, more in the likeness of its apparent value.&nbsp; I think the place I purchased this wine from took advantage of the name behind the bottle and marked it up quite nicely.&nbsp; Do I feel ripped off?&nbsp; Not really, I had been wanting to try a M. Chapoutier wine for some time after reading about the Rhone in my wine bible, I was able to find that wine at a local wine store and purchased it on impulse.&nbsp; I came to the wine store not looking for anything in particular and then I saw the Chapoutier.&nbsp; I paid for the luxury of buying that wine, that day, and consuming it that night versus purchasing it, and having it shipped.&nbsp; Okay, what's the point?&nbsp; Wine prices don't necessarily reflect the actually quality of that wine.&nbsp; Wow, that was a little more long winded than expected. <br /><br />The Tasting:<br />The wine had nice red fruit on the front, cherry, with a little plum, and a earthy aroma.&nbsp; The finish was short and sweet with an odd after taste.&nbsp; I couldn't pin point what the taste was, just bitterness. Overall, an okay wine not worth $28.&nbsp; It will not deter me from trying another Chapoutier, however.<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">**</span>

Enjoy. <br /><br />I recently ventured to the mother land known as Michigan to taste more wine, see family, see friends, partake in the Big Chill, and to check out one of the boldest restaurants/wine bars I have seen in Michigan, let a lone West Michigan.<br /><br />I arrived in Grand Rapids, escaping the giant snow storm hitting Minneapolis.&nbsp; I got in pretty late so I just went back to my Dad's and went to bed.&nbsp; I went to bed giddy, feeling like a kid going to bed on Christmas Eve.&nbsp; I knew that Friday would be a day filled with wine and food!&nbsp; We left for Reserve <a href="http://www.reservegr.com/">(Reserve, Grand Rapids</a>) around 3 in the afternoon in order to get there before the after work rush and traffic.&nbsp; It was a success.&nbsp; The menu was unlike anything I have seen in Michigan.... ever.&nbsp; Cheeses, smoked fish, cured meats, pork fat fries, just the craziest stuff you could possibly imagine.&nbsp; Definitely for those who are culinary explorers and want something out of the box... so I hate using this word... but, well it's for the "Foodies."&nbsp; I'm not going to get into my tyrad about Foodies, well maybe a little.&nbsp; I believe everyone, yes everyone is a Foodie, even if you don't know it.&nbsp; If you like food in any way, you are a Foodie, if you like to try new food, you are a Foodie, if you eat food, you are a Foodie... you get my drift.&nbsp; Foodie, Foodie, Foodie, blah.<br /><br />Back to Reserve, the place was very modern, sleek but cold.&nbsp; When modern is over done, for whatever reason, it feels cold to me.&nbsp; The food was amazing, we had a couple cheeses, some prosciutto.&nbsp; We also place an order for the Smoked Fish Trio which consisted of Lake Superior White Fish, Lake Michigan Trout, Wild Alaskan Salmon and was served with Kohlrabi and German Butterball Potato Salad, two words, Smokey Deliciousness!!&nbsp; I also had to have an order of the Pork Belly, which is hard to mess up..... it was rich, fatty, and yumyum.&nbsp; Sooo good!&nbsp; Just melted in my mouth.&nbsp; The food was absolutely superb!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TRPybCIBsMI/AAAAAAAAALY/6DXIcyc9bK4/s1600/IMG_20101210_165504.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto;

Had the below in the picture, since I was out with family and just wanting to enjoy myself I didn't really take any tasting notes on the wine just sipped and sort of decided in my head what I thought of them.&nbsp; I do remember that the star of this "Western Pinot" trio was the Vision Cellars out of Sonoma County, very interesting (<a href="http://www.visioncellars.com/">Vision Cellars</a>).<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TRPytwOydBI/AAAAAAAAALc/0e75-WoVViQ/s1600/IMG_20101210_171451.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TRPytwOydBI/AAAAAAAAALc/0e75-WoVViQ/s400/IMG_20101210_171451.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">From left to right, Scherrer, Ghost Hills Cellars, and Vision Cellars, all Pinot</td></tr></tbody></table>I was also impressed with their 100+ by glass wine options.&nbsp; How is this possible you ask?&nbsp; Well they have the largest Cruvinet (<a href="http://www.cruvinetsys.com/">Cruvinet Link</a>) Wine Bar System in Michigan and the first and largest I have seen in person.&nbsp; It basically preserves a opened bottle of wine for much longer than just opening a bottle and putting one of those stoppers in it.&nbsp; This allows the wine bar to offer slightly lowers prices (if it chooses to) and also offer a wider selection as the chance of the opening a wine and it not being drank is lower.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TRP0jIjoAUI/AAAAAAAAALg/EFUkDcyP84c/s1600/IMG_20101210_181349.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TRP0jIjoAUI/AAAAAAAAALg/EFUkDcyP84c/s400/IMG_20101210_181349.jpg" width="298" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Cruvinet System</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Overall, this place is a great place to out and adventure into wine and food in Grand Rapids, MI.&nbsp; I will warn you that it is expensive for what you are getting as it is probably the only place in the state that is like it.&nbsp; Well worth it in my opinion<br /><br />After Reserve we headed back to my Dad's for some Michigan wine and dinner.&nbsp; I selected three wines at a local wine shop and that were recommended to me by a friend that works at one of the wineries up in Northern Michigan.&nbsp; I wanted to revisit Michigan wines after tasting my way through many of California's wineries over the last 4 or 5 months.<br /><br />Since it is Wednesday, here are some brief tasting notes for G's Tasting Series.&nbsp; I have high hopes for Michigan wines as I hope to one day maybe return to open a winery.&nbsp; I hope that as the years go by the wine gets dialed in.&nbsp; I havent really tasted any Michigan wine of superb qualitiy however I have had some that were interesting and show serious promise.&nbsp; I am still in the infancy stages in tasting and also tasting Michigan wine so here we go!<br /><br /><u>2009 Chateau Chantal, Pinot Gris, Old Mission Peninsula</u><br />consumed Friday, Dec. 10, 2010, with family, Retail $21<br /><br />A nice wine.&nbsp; Aromas of freshly cut apples erupt out of the bottle.&nbsp; The wine is crisp, acidic, a little tart.&nbsp; It has a nice mouth feel and was very pleasant.&nbsp; I could only see myself sitting on a deck in the summer relaxing with this wine.&nbsp; Unfortunately as I tasted it I was starring out to the Michigan winter!<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">***</span><br /><u>2009 Chateau Chantal, Pinot Noir, Old Mission Peninsula</u><br />consumed Friday, Dec 10, 2010, with family, Retail $16<br /><br />Another nice wine from this producer.&nbsp; It has some out of a harsh nose open open but settled in after breathing some oxygen.&nbsp; There really wasn't much going on in the bottle off the first sniff but want on to reveal some tart cherry and some what of an earthy aroma.&nbsp; Also, apparent was what seemed to be a little smoke.&nbsp; Overall, again, a pleasant wine from the region.<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">**</span> <br /><br />The white wines from Northern Michigan seem to fair much better than the reds.&nbsp; One thing is for sure, I will continue my quest to find amazing wines in Michgain.&nbsp; I have found good wine but not that wine that just says, WOW!!! <br /><br />Saturday was spent with family and friends in Ann Arbor to watch the "Big Chill" which was an outdoor hockey game played at U of M stadium between Michigan State and U of M.&nbsp; It was great to be a part of it.&nbsp; The game set the world record for attendance at an outdoor hockey game and it set the record for highest attendance at Michigan Stadium ever!!&nbsp; A hockey game set the record for attendance (113,411, I think) at a football stadium, being a hockey player, I love it.<br /><br /><span id="goog_401485631"></span><span id="goog_401485632"></span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Coming up on G's Tasting Series, will be the highly regarded first growth Bordeaux's!!!&nbsp; As one of my friends told me, "A cork tease is someone who constantly talks about the wine he or she will open but never does."&nbsp; I love that saying, but it's not me, I drink the stuff.&nbsp; Look out for these two tasting notes!!!

It was probably a little more animated than that.&nbsp; For the people that know Mike, you can only imagine! ha.&nbsp; That is when I really started to think of taking my passion for wine and turning into a way of life.&nbsp; That is my story.&nbsp; Okay, so what's the point?&nbsp; If you've read my 'Welcome to my journey' post then you know what's up.&nbsp; So the reason for saying it again, is that I now have two answers to the question, how did you catch the wine bug?&nbsp; One is unconventional, at least in terms of the stories I have heard (read above if you haven't been paying attention :)) and the other answer is a 1999 Chateau Haut-Brion (well technically there are 3 answers, a 1992 Rochioli West Block as well)!&nbsp; So I guess I have an arsenal of answers, sense I am wordy as can be seen by this very blog, I will use all 3 answers.&nbsp; And after that long winded explanation of things.... here is my tasting note.<br /><br />This wine, for me, is why I love wine and why wine is so different.&nbsp; It is truly an expression of the land, all it is is fermented grapes that is it, nothing else.&nbsp; If terroir were a wine, this would be it.&nbsp; As we saw with the Chateau Pavie, this wine has just layers and layers of complexity.&nbsp; However, this complexity does not cause it to be out of control.&nbsp; It is balanced perfectly.&nbsp; The first smell gives way to a beautiful bouquet: sweet, sweet, candy cherry, a little raspberry, pepper.&nbsp; Then a layer of earth washed over me, and as I focused on this smell all I could come up with was gravel, then stone.&nbsp; It was subtle, it just reminded me of rocky soil.&nbsp; Then I remembered reading something in the Wine Bible about the soil in Graves, and yes, Graves is named after it's gravelly soil.&nbsp; It was so exciting trying to figure this out and gratifying, I was just going nuts when I started to sniff it out.&nbsp; As I look at my tasting note this is exactly what I had written, "gravel, dirt? soil, what's the soil? earthy, I can smell the soil, gravel, stone, check book (Wine Bible)."&nbsp; I finally got around to tasting the wine, and it was just as good as it smelled.&nbsp; Fruity on the palate, flavors concentrated, slight pepper.&nbsp; The finish was long and sweet.&nbsp; One quick note, it wasn't as tannic as the '99 Pavie from Saint Emillion, coming out of a 375ml bottle, this wine was ready to drink.&nbsp; It was silky smooth.&nbsp; What a great wine!<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">******</span>

Once you figured out one smell something else would come out in punch you in the face, it was that intense.&nbsp; The new aromas were subtle at first but once I focused on the smell it came out in a big way.&nbsp; The first aromas that came to mind were pepper, raspberry, and earth.&nbsp; Earth is hard to explain but it was as if I could smell the soil, fresh soil and stone.&nbsp; As a secondary note, I began to smell the ever slightest bit of licorice and a bit of leather.&nbsp; After an additional hour of the wine beginning opened a started to get a slight chocolate note.&nbsp; Near the end I swear I was starting to get a little eucalyptus or mint on the nose and at that point I decided to actually taste the wine and enjoy it!&nbsp; <br /><br />The mouth feel was brilliant.&nbsp; The wine was so vibrant on the tongue, just lovely.&nbsp; Bright red fruit, a little spice, and leather which lingered through the retro nasal (after taste) pleasantly.&nbsp; I swear I was tasting that wine for the rest of the night even after it was gone.&nbsp; I was also surprised that the wine was still pretty tannic, meaning it can probably age even further and continue to develop in the bottle.&nbsp; The wine also had beautiful color, opaque blood red. and a more orange burgundy color at the edge of the glass.&nbsp; Just an awesome wine, I cannot wait to visit France!<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">******</span>&nbsp; <br /><br />Next week, 1999 Chateau Haut-Brion!

Woooo!&nbsp; <br /><br />Ahh, Boeuf bourguignon, the classic French dish that has swooned many people through out the world.&nbsp; This dish was soooo good, the meat so tender.&nbsp; Anything made with wine, and a red Burgundy especially is guaranteed to be good.<br /><br />So what is in this classic dish you ask?&nbsp; I hope that you are not hungry right now, if you are grab a snack, because it will just make you even hungrier, even drool.<br /><br />Paleron of beef<br />Salt and pepper (no your never gonna get it... no not this time.... remember that song.. awesome) (EDIT:&nbsp; 2/2, I stand corrected, the song above was En Vogue not Salt n Pepper, Thanks Chelsea :) )<br />Olive oil<br />Onions<br />Red Burgundy<br />Carrots<br />Garlic clove<br />Bouquet garni<br />Flat parsley<br /><br />Hungry?? Grab a Snickers.&nbsp; So basically you add all of this stuff in pot and let it cook for 2-3 hours until the meat is just juicy and tender.&nbsp; The only tricky part to cooking this dish is browning the meat, you have to make sure your oil is hot enough (right before it starts to smoke), secondly you need to get your simmer right so the sauce reduces and is concentrated when ready to eat.&nbsp; Also, because you are only using a cup of Burgundy you will have a lot to drink!&nbsp; Another awesome plus! <br /><br />I can't explain how good this dish was!&nbsp; The meet so tender, so juicy, so yum.&nbsp; It's perfect for a cold to warm day.&nbsp; Writing this is making me soooooooo hungry!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_JNBdhpo8chU/TTOYVOQVMcI/AAAAAAAAAL4/p-FMRits7uU/s1600/IMG_20110106_181642.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Just reading this recipe made me want to cry from the joy of the types of meat were in this bad boy.&nbsp; Vegetarians please do not proceed pass this sentence.&nbsp; Dishes like this make me wonder how anyone can be a vegetarian.<br /><br />The ingredients:<br />Paleron of beef<br />Oxtail<br />Short ribs<br />Veal shank (bone in so you an suck the marrow)<br />Cloves<br />Onions<br />Leeks<br />Celery root<br />Carrots<br />Potatoes<br />Cabbage<br />Bouquet garni<br />Salt and pepper<br />Cornichons (for garnish)<br />Gros sel (for garnish)<br />Hot prepared mustard (for garnish)<br /><br />This is another stew like dish, basically simmering meet with all of the goodness above for 3 hours.&nbsp; The hardest part to the recipe was the "slow simmer" which was constantly hard to hit all night.&nbsp; We also realized that we didn't have a big enough pot to do it all in one so we split the recipe and just used two.&nbsp; There was soooo much food in this thing that we had the ability to experiment a little with left over juices.&nbsp; The meat itself was amazing, slowly simmered meat cannot be touched by an oven.&nbsp; This meat was so tender and juicy, it just fell off the bone.&nbsp; It was meat candy! &nbsp; <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Whoa is me, haha, not really, life is great! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I was looking back through my tasting book and I stumbled on some early tasting notes, while I will admit I am certainly still an amateur (hence the Wine Immersion at CIA) this tasting note is one of my earliest and around when I decided to pursue wine full on.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot going on in the world of viticulture in the United States.&nbsp; As we are a fairly young nation compared to the rest of the world, so is our viticulture.&nbsp; Yes, we have California, and have Oregon and Washington State however there seems to be new plantings and vines coming to age in places like Virginia (tasted), Arizona (tasted), Texas Hill Country (haven't tasted) to name a few.&nbsp; The wine I am about to talk about is from Virginia, specifically just west of Charlottesville.&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson had struggled to grow vines at his Monticello estate (which is beautiful).&nbsp; There seems to be a new lease on the wine coming from Virginia.&nbsp; If I recall this Mountfair that I tried was the wineries first efforts hence the name Inaugural I suppose.<br /><br /><u> 2008 Mountfair Inaugural, Cabernet Franc/Merlot, Monticello, Virginia</u><br />consumed sometime in 2009, $20.00<br /><br />If I recall this wine was pretty good for the price and I probably drank it way too young.&nbsp; A blend of 66% Cabernet Franc and 34% Merlot sweet, plum, vegetative (from the Cab Franc), spice, a little damp earth.&nbsp; A nice ripe fruit blast in the front palate, mid and finish were lacking.&nbsp; I wrote down that it was quite oakey, possibly too much oak? For the price of $20.00, I called it a good buy.<br /><br />For all of you east coasters near Virginia, here are a couple wineries I remember liking and that I'd love to revisit so send me some!!&nbsp; Barboursville winery (<a href="http://www.barboursvillewine.net/winery/vineyard-and-wines">Barboursville Wine</a>), Virginia, try their Octagon, I remember it being pretty dang good back then.&nbsp; Also, try Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard, Maryland, west of Washington, D.C. maybe two hours (<a href="http://www.smvwinery.com/">Sugarloaf Winery</a>). &nbsp; Happy tasting and Happy Friday! <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-octhGxVfafM/TV4XQfyC31I/AAAAAAAAANI/J6Ch8-REb3Q/s1600/various+026.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-octhGxVfafM/TV4XQfyC31I/AAAAAAAAANI/J6Ch8-REb3Q/s400/various+026.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sugarloaf Mountain Winery</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R8UpGf0otJQ/TV4XQqtrdBI/AAAAAAAAANM/7dVboI5y0HM/s1600/various+027.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R8UpGf0otJQ/TV4XQqtrdBI/AAAAAAAAANM/7dVboI5y0HM/s400/various+027.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sugarloaf Mountain Winery</td></tr></tbody></table>

I returned home after visiting with the aforementioned places and people.&nbsp; About a week later, the tasting room manager at the winery called me and asked if I would want to work in the tasting room.&nbsp; We began talking about my trip to France and making sure that they knew I would be gone for that month.&nbsp; She mentioned that she knew someone in Southern Rhone who wrote a French blog, I said "French Word of the Day?"&nbsp; She, "Yes!"&nbsp; I couldn't believe it, I have been an avid reader of the blog for the last year, such a small world.&nbsp; She said, "they are a wonderful family and just email her."&nbsp; Also, the family owns a winery, Domaine Rouge-Bleu!! To make a long story short, I emailed Kristin, author of the blog, and she replied the next day with, "we'd love to have you by the winery!!"&nbsp; I was so excited, still am, she also threw in there, "too bad you won't be here in September to help with harvest".....hmmmmmm!&nbsp; Woooooooooo!&nbsp; France, only 3 months away.&nbsp; The 3 of us on the trip, keep going back and forth..... are we going to come back?&nbsp; To put this trip into perspective I did a little calculation, if we average 8 wineries a day and assuming they pour 4 different wines, we will have tasted over 900 unique wines during the trip.&nbsp; Holy guacamole batman that's a lot. <br /><br />I'm in the process of moving back to Healdsburg for class so I haven't been able to post a new tasting note.&nbsp; I start class on Tuesday!

I forgot to mention the food, games hens, with tarragon, breaded egg plant with homemade sauce made from the tomatoes grown in the garden.&nbsp; If there is one central theme to Northern California it is this, Eat great food, drink great wine, and share it with everyone!<br /><br />Off to work, then Bistro Jeanty for dinner tonight! &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><h1><span style="font-size: small;"></span></h1>

		<document id="c06f1a4e8d29fe27c4e08dfaf0a61a53" url="http://questwine.blogspot.com/2011/04/where-to-next.html"><![CDATA[I am back, after a month long immersion in wine at the Culinary Institute of American (CIA).&nbsp; I learned so much during the time I was at the CIA.&nbsp; Hands down the best learning institution I have ever been at.&nbsp; The caliber of teaching and the practical experience is unmatched.&nbsp; Every one at this institution&nbsp;was so willing to help and really took ownership in making sure we learned and were on the right track for our next moves.&nbsp; I&nbsp;highly recommend the school.&nbsp; They&nbsp;have all sorts of classes that you can take (<a href="http://www.ciachef.edu/">Culinary Institute of America</a>).<br /><br />What's next?&nbsp; Going into the program I had this notion that it would help narrow my interests in food and wine, meaning I thought I would walk out of there with being able to say, "I am going to open 'X', for sure."&nbsp; The opposite has happened, the program has opened so many more doors into the realm of what business(s) I want to open.&nbsp; Throughout class I was constantly scribbling ideas that would come to me as I was listening to my instructors.&nbsp; It's really exciting and overwhelming.&nbsp; I can't focus on one idea, I get lost in multiple ideas at a time and find myself wondering where to start.&nbsp; Of the classes I took at the CIA the Wine Business class and Food and Wine pairing class really had me on the edge of my seat.&nbsp; I know that the first business is going to be something with food and wine which, for me, has been the original starting point all a long with the ultimate goal of owing a winery.&nbsp; I think I have said this before, but the saying in the wine business goes something like if you want to make a million in a winery spend ten million.&nbsp; Its extremely expensive to start a winery and especially expensive if you plan on planting your own grapes!&nbsp; My first vision is to start a business with a focus on food and wine with a heavy emphasis on wine education.&nbsp; The key here is making wine education down to earth and fun!&nbsp; Karen MacNeil (<a href="http://www.karenmacneil.com/">Karen MacNeil.com</a>) said something to our class like, "wine grabs a hold of your mind and the more you know about it the more interesting it gets."&nbsp; This is exactly what is happening to me.&nbsp; I hope to some day have a forum, besides this blog, to share all of my knowledge and experience with wine with you.&nbsp; For now, I will push forward and continue to learn.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />With that, after one month long 'immersion' ends another begins!&nbsp; France is quickly approaching and I find myself buried in information and scheduling appointments with wineries.&nbsp; France is nothing like Walt Disney World, I mean Napa, you have to have appointments in advance and from what I hear you are sometimes walking up to someones house and spending the afternoon with them.&nbsp; When I began the Wine Immersion at the CIA I had the idea that I would try for maybe six wineries a day, sort of like what I average when I am out and about tasting in California.&nbsp; After speaking to many of my instructors this number has gone from six to two!&nbsp; The general consensus is that if the people you are tasting with like you, and everything is going well, you could end up being there from your appointment at say 10am through lunch (2pm) and then off to your last appointment at 3pm.&nbsp; I am adhering to this advice with some back up plans if not every tasting goes long.&nbsp; I am also planning on bringing a bunch of wine from here to share with the people I taste with.<br /><br />Here is the outline of our trip thus far!<br />Paris - 1 week<br />Burgundy - 1 week<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Chablis Visits: Michel Laroche, Louis Michel et Fils, Daniel-Etienne Defaix, and William Fevre<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Gevery-Chambertin: Henri Rebourseau<br />Northern Rhone - 3 days<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Alain Graillot<br />Southern Rhone/Provence - 4 days<br />Bordeaux - 1 week<br /><br />As you can see, I have barely put a dent in the sheer amount of appointments I need to make.&nbsp; It's going to be a bust April!&nbsp; I have maybe 3 days out of the entire trip planned!&nbsp; Speaking of which, I better get back to setting 'em up.&nbsp; Below you will find a bunch of picture taken from when I was up at the CIA.&nbsp;

The wine showed a racing acidity with a tannic structure that gave the wine a strong backbone.&nbsp; I am sure this wine was a great "value" wine three years ago (depending on what you consider to be value, as it was 40 bucks!).&nbsp; At age five it seems to be just about finished.<br /><br />Does this change my view of Vincent Girardin? Not at all.&nbsp; I have had some excellent wines from this producer.&nbsp; Maybe an off vintage and an introductory wine from his vast portfolio that wasn't meant to be aged five+ years?<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">**</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3LcQUMIuLyc/TdG4-pyo4FI/AAAAAAAAAOk/0C0l0jd7kn0/s1600/IMG_20110516_164345.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3LcQUMIuLyc/TdG4-pyo4FI/AAAAAAAAAOk/0C0l0jd7kn0/s400/IMG_20110516_164345.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</span> <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

It seems like yesterday that my friend Mike and I first dreamed of this trip (well over a year ago).&nbsp; A month in France: Paris, Burgundy, Rhone, Provence, Bordeaux and possibly a trip to Normandy to visit a friend's family for the night.&nbsp; There are a lot of things running through my head.&nbsp; I have read extensively about french culture and it all sounds so interesting and enticing.&nbsp; From the five week vacations, the love of food and wine, to the love for life in general!&nbsp; I have been to France before but I was just a young punk!&nbsp; I know that after this experience I will not be the same person, I wonder if, when I get back, that I yearn to be back in France.&nbsp; It just seems the complete opposite to American culture which is driving me nuts lately, where is our country?&nbsp; It seems possessed by drones and zombies.&nbsp; I just feel annoyed with this country, the culture, and especially the politics.&nbsp; It seems the country is completely on the wrong track, more government intervention, more rules, more idiots in D.C., more bureaucracy, more big, giant, incompetent big brother.&nbsp; I cannot wait to get out of this country for some air, before I drown.&nbsp; You hear all sorts of interesting things in our media or from people about what they think of France, all of it, I don't believe.&nbsp; I basically have given up on believing anything the media or "officials" say.&nbsp; Okay, before I go off on a tangent let's get back to the trip.<br /><br />Thirty wineries in three weeks, our stop in Paris is more about Paris than tasting wine, you could say its a primer for the rest of the trip.&nbsp; Here are the wineries we are visiting.<br /><br /><u>First stop, Burgundy</u><br />William Fevre, Michel Laroche L'Obediencerie, Louis Michel et Fils, Domaine Daniel Etienne Defaix, Domaine Daniel Rion, Domaine Henri Rebourseau, Domaine Michel Gros, Domaine Trapet Pere and Fils, Maison Joseph Drouhin, Louis Latour, Louis Jadot.<br /><br /><u>Rhone/Provence</u><br />Jean-Luc Colombo, Alain Graillot, M. Chapoutier, Domaine Tempier, Chateau la Nerthe, Domaine Rouge Bleu, Domaine du Vieux Telegraphe, Clos des Papes, Domaine du Cayron, Chateau de Saint Cosme, Domaine la Garrigue, Domaine de Durban.<br /><br /><u>Bordeaux</u><br />Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte, Chateau Haut-Goujon, Chateau Figeac, Chateau Lynch-Bages, Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion, Château La Louvière, Chateau Certan.<br /><br />Wooooooo!<br /><br />A lot of things are happening and have happened, I have this constant feeling of sheer happiness, borderline euphoria about the prospects for the future.&nbsp; First looking back, from my first harvest with Rochioli, to the amazing people I met at the Culinary Institute of America, people I will be be in touch with for the rest of my life.&nbsp; To the future, the trip to France of course, harvest again, and the launching of my company (more details on this as the details become details haha).&nbsp; After trying last year and coming up short, my friend Mike, who started this whole thing with a simple question, "if I get into the wine industry will you join me?" I said "but of course," has finally gotten a harvest internship, and thus the journey begins with the ultimate goal of starting and launching a winery like no other.&nbsp; To think this all started with being laid off, the best thing that ever happened to me!&nbsp; It certainly didn't feel that way when it happened! <br /><br />Off to France!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a2YswbqpPpA/Td2N6sakMMI/AAAAAAAAAOo/qPmqoXD2Dyc/s1600/9074098-french-cock.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="256" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-a2YswbqpPpA/Td2N6sakMMI/AAAAAAAAAOo/qPmqoXD2Dyc/s320/9074098-french-cock.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br /><u> </u>

As you can imagine I had zero time to update this blog even though there were so many times that I wanted to.&nbsp; I can think of no other way than to start with the wines of France, the people I met, the wines we tasted, and the regions we went too.&nbsp; I will follow up with the cities we visited and focus on each of them.&nbsp; This will be a great way for me to document in writing everything I can remember from the trip.&nbsp; You see I began to write everything down, I had the urge too, I always do.&nbsp; However, after a week or so in France I decided to stop, sort of coming to a conclusion that writing everything down was distracting from the immersion of France.&nbsp; After all, I never go back and read my entries anyway.&nbsp; On to our first stop, this was after about five days in Paris (which I will talk about later).<br /><br />After a nightmarish pack up of our place in Paris and pick up of our rental car that included a broken sandal and Mike getting pinned in the Metro with one bag in front him and one on his back, in the turnstile, then shaking frantically to get out of it, not funny at the time, funny now.&nbsp; After about a four hour drive, our first stop was Chablis where the grape variety is all chardonnay. <br /><br />If you are used to American chardonnays with their fat oakey roundness, you would be certainly surprised with Chablis.&nbsp; The same grape is expressed in a tight, laser focus, austerity that would zap the oldest tasted buds and a mineral punch, primarily due to it's kimmeridgian soil (a combination of sea shell fossils, and&nbsp; limestone).&nbsp; With age is wine Chablis wines become fun.&nbsp; I was introduced to this with a 2007 Louis Michel et Fils, Vaudesir (Grand Cru), which I happily purchased, the wine began to show this forest floor, pine needley, almost mushroom bouquet.&nbsp; I have never found this in a white wine and it absolutely fascinated me.&nbsp; Our visit with Louis Michel et Fils was certainly my favorite visit.&nbsp; Guillaume, the vigneron at Louis Michel, really took the time to explain Chablis and his story about how he made it back to the family business which was a common story throughout our trip.&nbsp; To keep it short, Guillaume was working in Paris, had a nice job etc.. then one day while on a severely crammed metro, hugging a pole, and feeling like a sardine, that is when he decided that the hustle was enough, phoned is Unkle, and said "I'm coming back!"&nbsp; I also shared a Rochioli chardonnay with him, which, while different than Chablis, he appreciated the bright acidity in such a warm wine (referring to ripeness), and said he would share it with his family and friends.&nbsp;<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

I was shocked to find out that most (large) houses are using oak and a lot of it.&nbsp; Not necessarily new oak but it was quite evident to me with the Fevre wines.&nbsp; I don't know how I don't have pictures if this, I swear I took them, but a sign of things to come was our visit with Fevre.&nbsp; Walking into the little tasting room, our host, said, welcome, lets hop into the van and go to the vineyard..... a little stunned, not used to this compared to tasting in America.&nbsp; I was excited!&nbsp; We spent about an hour walking the grand cru vineyards of Chablis, rubbing my hands in the soil, and talking about the vines and what makes Chablis, Chablis.&nbsp; Overall, a great warm up to things to come on our trip.&nbsp;

Good, but not great. &nbsp;I had a seafood pizza with escargot and other goodies, but the crust was more like pie crust than pizza crust. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BuQK0dvt5aU/TiIKvc40OCI/AAAAAAAAAVk/8TZDUwL1MzE/s1600/France+530.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

Upon arriving I start in on my terrible French, Bonjour Madam, nous sommes ici pour rendez-vous, she responds something back in French, and I immediately switch to Parlez-vous anglais, to which she responds yes, a little. &nbsp;In fact, a little was a lot, she spoke great English. &nbsp;The lady speaking to us was in fact the daughter of the man who started the winery, and a long with her two brothers, run the vineyards and winery now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Srmo-60YRxI/TmQYS14gc7I/AAAAAAAAAdk/jrws558u-58/s1600/France+654.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Srmo-60YRxI/TmQYS14gc7I/AAAAAAAAAdk/jrws558u-58/s400/France+654.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />After petting the dog, we finally found the owner running from what looked like the office (a little old hut) back to his house (an old old house). &nbsp;He ran up to us, and I started in on my awful French, and he said he had to finish something and ran back in the house. &nbsp;Once he came back, he greeted us,&nbsp;and took us over to another building on the property where we just talked about Burgundy, the different vineyards, his&nbsp;philosophies, shared stories and the like. &nbsp;Mr. de Surrel spent a good part of an hour teaching us about Burgundy to which I am grateful. &nbsp;One thing he mentioned is that, in general, the best grand crus come from the sort of "middle bench" of the slope, a good piece of information to have. &nbsp;After our information session, he pulled out one of those old giant keys, to which he had about fifteen of them on his key right for various places on the property, and ushered us over to this littler door, and into the dark, dank, cellar we went. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don't have picture of inside the cellar, but it was something out of Tales from the Crypt. &nbsp;This is where I really started to enjoy and understand what Burgundy was all about. &nbsp;We tasted his four grand crus, Chambertin, Mazy-Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, and Clos de Vougeot with Chambertin stealing the show. &nbsp;Looking at my tasting notes, which were scribbled on the back of google directions I noted that Chambertin was big and manly and that the&nbsp;finish went on and on while Clos de Vougeot was more mineral. &nbsp;Mr. de Surrel says, "you see, the wine comes from the ground." &nbsp;At the end of our tasting Mr. de Surrel said this, "there are two things that I look for in a great wine, that it is all encompassing, no one component sticks out, and that the finish is long." <br /><br />I am not sure if I mentioned this but I brought over eight bottles of wine from American to share with the best visits that I had. &nbsp;I brought a bunch of Rochioli and Ridge wine. &nbsp;I felt this was an&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to share, so I pulled out a Rochioli Pinot and we sat and tasted. &nbsp;Mr. de Surrel, simply said, I can smell the sun in this wine, but it also has acidity. &nbsp;He seemed to like the wine. &nbsp;This visit was one of my most memorable experiences in France and Burgundy.<br /><br />We were then off to our third and final appointment of the day at Domaine Michel Gros. &nbsp;But first a quick picture break.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;
