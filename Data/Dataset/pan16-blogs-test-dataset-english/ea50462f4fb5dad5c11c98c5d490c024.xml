This time, instead of using box pasta, I decided to make homemade fettuccine and add my famous cream sauce. I think the fresh pasta really compliments the other ingredients and it elevates this dish to another level of excellence.

Typically you would use spaghetti but since I had none, I improvised with Linguini which was equally amazing. Lastly, I recommend using bacon or Parma Ham instead of sausage but use whatever you have and it will be delicious.

In my opinion, they are absolutely perfect for pairing with pasta because you get a bite of scallop with every twirl! I really wanted to make this dish POP, so instead of using regular spaghetti I used spinach but I decided to give it even more of an edge by adding a habanero pepper to the sauce! This dish is comfort, elegance and heat all in one! Enjoy!

I love making this on a hot summer night because when you're in the mood for something sweet but you're already full from dinner this is the perfect compliment to any summer meal. 



Simply purchase a plain angel food cake, slice up your favorite fresh summer fruits and add a dollop of whipped cream (or "whipped topping"). 

That's it. Simple. Easy. Fresh. Delicious. 

Isn't that what summer
