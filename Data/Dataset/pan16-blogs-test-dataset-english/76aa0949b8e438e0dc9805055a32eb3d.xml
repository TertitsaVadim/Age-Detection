		           		<p>It is a bit of a cliche (sorry) but the story of retailing over the past six months has in part been the story of the weather.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In the balmy summer, we all went shopping barmy. &#34;Everyone bought expensive food for picnics and bikinis&#34; as one retailing supremo put it to me (I am not sure I did, but I am probably the exception).</p>

		           		<p>There is more evidence today of the strength of Britain's recovery in the confirmation that the UK's car market last year returned to the kind of buoyant conditions not seen since before the 2007-8 crash.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There was a rise in motor sales of almost 11% to 2.26 million vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.</p>

		           		<p>In the third quarter of its year, Sainsbury's underlying, or like-for-like, sales grew a tiny bit, 0.2%, excluding fuel, and were flat as a pancake including fuel. This compares with rises of 2.1% and 2% respectively in the strong second quarter of the year.</p>

		           		<p>This morning's statement from the Treasury that the UK will stand behind all its sovereign debts, whether or not Scotland's people vote for independence, is in a way a statement of the bleedin' obvious.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That debt, all £1.4 trillion of it, is an obligation of the National Loans Fund.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And nothing can change that - whether Scotland were to decide to secede (or, to pick an unlikely corollary, in the event that the People's Liberation Army of West Sussex, miffed about fracking, were to declare UDI).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So why has the Treasury chosen to say that the UK will honour its debts, whatever Scotland does?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, it is because investors - whom we may think of as sophisticated and informed (ahem) - have been increasingly asking the Treasury and the Debt Management Office for clarification of the status of the UK's financial obligations in the event of a fracturing of the United Kingdom.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>For example officials have been asked whether UK government bonds, or gilts, would be split into Scottish bonds and Rest of UK bonds.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And what would be the coupon or interest rate on these two new classes of bonds, were that to happen?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>No kind of restructuring of the debt, of that sort or any other, is going to happen, the Treasury has now made explicit.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It felt it had to do so because it feared that at some juncture the uncertainty could increase the perceived risk of lending to the UK government - and that could in turn increase the cost for the government of borrowing.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Better therefore to be blunt and clear, that the full £1.4tn would stay as a liability of England, Wales and Northern Ireland - and that there would be no legal requirement on Scottish people to pay any of it.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>UK government bonds and Treasury bills (short-term debt) would not be split or changed in any way. They would remain as the debts of all us.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That's a bit nice for the Scots, you might think.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Who would not vote for independence if an autonomous, separate Scotland would be set free from the burden of UK debts currently equivalent to 76% of GDP or national income (on the latest estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility)?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Except that even Alex Salmond and the Scot Nats don't believe that an independent Scotland could, in practice, walk away from its fair share of the UK's debts - even if they would have the legal ability to do so.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Why would it be rational for a Scottish government to take on some of those debts?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well because Salmond also wants to negotiate ownership of certain assets (North Sea oil springs to mind). And he wants an agreement on being part of a formal sterling zone, in which Scotland would retain the pound and have some kind of influence over the Bank England's approach to monetary policy.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Perhaps even more importantly, if Scotland were seen to be repudiating all UK debts, investors might be very reluctant to lend even a brass farthing to it as an independent state.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is why the Scottish government's White Paper on all this makes it absolutely clear that an independent Scotland would be liable for some of the current national debt.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In the event of independence, Salmond would negotiate for Scotland to service - pay the interest and principal - of a certain portion of the UK's debts.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, Scotland would become a debtor of the rest of the UK, or of the Treasury in London.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And when you put it that way, you can perhaps see why any eventual talks on this would be pretty fraught and difficult.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The following issues would have to be resolved:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>1) What share of the debt could fairly be ascribed to Scotland?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>2) What interest rate should Scotland pay to the Treasury?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>3) Over what time period would the Scottish government be required to repay all its debts to the rest of the UK?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Taking the last first, the time period to repay all the debt, presumably that should mirror the debt profile of UK's current debts - which has an average maturity of 14.5 years.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>For the first issue, Salmond's White Paper argues that the share of debts assumed by Scotland could be calculated by reference to the population or the net central government money (fiscal transfers) received by Scotland since 1980.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>On both these measures, Scottish debt as a percentage of national income would be below that for the rest of the UK.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But even if that argument were to fly with the Treasury, the chancellor could argue that Scotland should pay a higher interest rate than that paid by the British government - because Scotland, as a smaller economy with no fiscal track record, would be seen as a riskier borrower than the Rest of the UK.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Bankers tell me that markets would probably force Scotland to pay up to 1.5 percentage points more to borrow, initially at least, than the UK currently pays.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>A British Chancellor could therefore argue, perhaps, that Scotland should pay that market rate to him too.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And, by the way, this issue - of what investors would charge Scotland for funds - is likely to be a pretty hot one in the referendum campaigns, since it will have a material impact on the country's prosperity in general (the interest rate paid by a government is the benchmark for the rate paid by all borrowers in a country) and Scotland's ability to fund public services in particular.</p>

		           		<p>Clive Adamson, the financial regulator who last week told MPs that the widely criticised appointment of Paul Flowers as chairman of Co-op Bank was the &#34;right decision at the time&#34;, is today under fire for alleged &#34;disturbing inaccuracies&#34; in his evidence to the Treasury Select Committee.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mark Taber, the financial specialist who corralled retail holders of Co-op Bank's bonds to accept the failing bank's rescue plan, accuses Mr Adamson of misrepresenting &#34;the FCA's involvement in the restructuring&#34; and &#34;are even incorrect as to the deal we ultimately negotiated for retail investors&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Adamson, the director of supervision at the Financial Conduct Authority, told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee: &#34;The retail bondholders, in my view, received as best a deal as we could get for them&#34; and that he accepts &#34;responsibility for doing the best for bondholders that we could do given the events that have occurred&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But Mr Taber, in a letter to members of the Treasury Select Committee, makes a couple of claims:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>1) That the FCA never responded to a request from the retail bondholders' legal advisers for the FCA to force the Co-op to engage formally with the retail investors.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>2) That in reply to a letter from Mr Taber and Niall Booker (Co-op Bank's chief executive) to Mr Adamson and Martin Wheatley (chief executive of the FCA), requesting help in the communication of the rescue offer to bondholders - because Co-op Bank would have gone bust if the offer had not been accepted - the FCA said that it was &#34;not responsible for proactively driving communication of the offer&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Taber cites emails from the Co-op Bank and two leading investment banks, Greenhill and Moelis, corroborating his claims.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Adamson also told MPs that most retail bondholders &#34;retained their income for 10 years and then suffer a haircut thereafter&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In fact, retail bondholders had a choice of maintaining their income for 12 years, at which point the value of their entire investment would be wiped out (which is not the same as a haircut), or took reduced income for 10 or 12 years and then would incur a haircut (loss of capital value) of between 15% and 50%.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The FCA said: &#34;We strongly refute any suggestion that Clive Adamson misrepresented the FCA's role in the Co-op Bank's Liability Management Exercise (LME). The FCA's role in the LME has always been to ensure bondholders are treated fairly.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;Because of the recently announced enforcement investigations by the FCA and PRA, we cannot provide further comment. The Chancellor has also announced an independent review into the events that led to the LME and this will include the role of the FSA and its successors, the PRA and FCA.&#34;</p>

		           		<p>If it's January, it's time for the traditional disclosure that hundreds of bankers in London are earning considerably more than £1m each, prompting outrage from Labour and embarrassment on the part of the government.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The dance has been more-or-less the same every year since the Crash of 2008.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And although pay levels for bankers have fallen a bit since then, and more remuneration is deferred and capable of being cancelled if deals go bad, the sums shelled out still look enormous at a time when earnings for the vast majority of households continue to be squeezed.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is however an awkward twist for the government this year. Which is that new European Union rules mean that if banks want to pay bonuses greater than 100% of salary, they have to get the approval of shareholders - and in the case of semi-nationalised Lloyds and RBS (in particular) that would require a &#34;yes&#34; from the Treasury.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>To labour the point, the government, as 80% shareholder in RBS, would have to formally approve any desire by RBS to pay 200% bonuses to its top people.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So, does RBS want to do this?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, the huge bank is &#34;consulting its shareholders about this&#34; but insists that it has made no formal request.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As for the Treasury, it too says that RBS &#34;has not made a request&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And the Treasury also points out that it is challenging the EU cap on bonuses in court, because it agrees with the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, Andrew Bailey, that any limit on bonuses will &#34;just increase base pay, reduce claw back [the ability to get money back for poor performance] and undermine financial stability&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to remind you what you already know, for bankers big pay is as natural as cold weather in January. And if they don't get it in the form of enormous bonuses, they'll take it in higher salaries - or move to Switzerland, New York or Singapore.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Some might say good riddance. But owners of banks that cannot move their branches to Switzerland, New York or Singapore might fear that the value of what's left would be depleted.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Labour, of course, sees what looks like a wide open, undefended goal, and is calling on the government not to sanction big bonuses at RBS.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Whether Labour would take precisely the same view if it were in government and was the RBS shareholder, and if it was advised that not to pay the market rate would lead to the exodus of whatever talent is still at this political football of a bank, well that is the kind of hypothetical question that could make us all go blind, if we thought about it too much.</p>

		           		<p>The Labour leader's plan to ask the new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate whether there is adequate competition between the UK's big banks is a pretty alarming prospect for those banks.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>They will wonder whether there will ever again be a time when they are not being crawled all over and under by assorted regulators, investigators and commissioners.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Just in the opening years of this parliament they have been probed in a comprehensive sense by an Independent Commission on Banking and a Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, and in a narrower way by the defunct Financial Services Authority, the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Prudential Regulation Authority and assorted official bodies all over the world (almost too many of them to mention).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It is no longer appropriate to say that business as usual for banks is prevented by all the uncertainty - about their respective structures or cultures or size - created by the assorted investigations. Business as usual for banks is to be permanently under investigation, and will remain that way for years.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That is a price they have paid for their sins in the boom years, and their leading role in the 2008 financial calamity that hobbled all the leading western economies.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Of course it is a price that we pay too, in bank share prices that may be a bit lower than would otherwise be the case (we own the semi-nationalised banks as taxpayers, the others through our pension schemes).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But, interestingly, customers do not appear to be picking up any kind of bill, or at least not yet. Arguably all this scrutiny has forced the banks to be a little more assiduous when it comes to customer service, and less ready to rip us off when we're not looking.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So what should any review of the banks by the soon-to-be created new super competition regulator focus on?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, although it is a bit embarrassing for Ed Miliband that the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, voiced scepticism yesterday that competition would be significantly enhanced by breaking banks up or forcing them to slim down, he would never claim to be a competition expert.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So although his writ runs more or less everywhere in the financial world and economy, perhaps on this he should not be seen as the oracle.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As the Independent Commission on Banking said in its final report, it would be legitimate by 2015 to examine whether the divestiture of TSB by Lloyds has created a strong new competitor, whether it has become significantly easier to switch banks and whether the FCA is &#34;demonstrating progress to improve transparency and reduce barriers to entry and growth by rivals to incumbent banks&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But there is one important issue about the structure of banks which is both fundamentally important and has been largely ignored in recent years - which is whether the biggest barrier to proper competition in banking is the big banks' ownership of the payments system.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Funnily enough, it was an investigation by the last Labour government some 15 years ago - commissioned by Gordon Brown and carried out by Don Cruickshank - which characterised the payments system as a utility that ought to be regulated in a formal and intrusive way on a permanent basis.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Cruickshank recommended that a specialist regulator should be created to set the price for using the payments system to ensure that all banks had equal access to it on non-discriminatory terms.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The government said it agreed with him, and then - over a period of many years, after further reviews and consultations - did very little about it.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>When I talk to those running banks big and small, they say that the competitive playing field could be levelled in a significant way, if the payments system became an independent, price-regulated utility, available to be used on equal terms by all authorised banks, whether big or small.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or at least they do, when not suffering from a panic attack at the putative logistical challenge and cost of de-merging all the software and hardware and people.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is another argument for creating a separate regulated payments network - the equivalent for banks of the National Grid - which could be seen to be in the big banks' interests.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The payments system is huge, creaking and inefficient, built on layer after layer of obsolete computer systems, which may never be overhauled as thoroughly as may be necessary, if banks can get away with patching it up.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In an internet world, it looks like a steam engine. A proper regulator might force banks to invest the necessary sums to turn it into a diesel engine, at the least.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Why the need?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well for me, perhaps the most interesting thing about modish bitcoin - the online money - is that it is perhaps the first monetary system that makes no use at all of banks' transmission systems. Bitcoin, among other things, is a frictionless, costless way of moving money all over the planet.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Bitcoin is an existential challenge to the banks. But that is a story for another day.</p>

		           		<p>Ed Miliband will on Friday commit that a Labour government would create two new large banks to challenge the existing big banks.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It would instruct the soon-to-be created Competition and Markets Authority to devise the exact way to create these banks.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Labour officials have told me that it would expect the new challenger banks to each have at least 6% of the personal current account market - which was a criterion used by the Independent Banking Commission for an effective competitor.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>These officials acknowledged this would entail the break up of the UK's largest retail banks, including Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>They accepted that the uncertainty about the future structure of the two banks could blow up any attempt to privatise RBS before the election, or to sell any more of taxpayers' shares in Lloyds before it is clear who will form the next government.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It would be very difficult to value either bank before it is known whether the break up would happen - which is why privatisation would be jeopardised.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Labour's plans could also lead to the forced sale of branches by Barclays and HSBC.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The plans are therefore likely to lead to falls in the share prices of big banks on Friday.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Extracts of a speech to be given by Labour's leader tomorrow say that &#34;we have to get to the root of the decades-long problem in British banking: too much power concentrated in too few hands.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;Britain has one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world, with just four banks controlling 85% of small business lending.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>To tackle the alleged excessive market power of banks, he will pledge that a Labour government would instruct the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to rule on:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>1) How many &#34;additional branches the big banks will need to sell off&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>2) &#34;The timetable for the divestment of branches beginning within six months of the report and completed within a five year maximum parliament&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>3) A new maximum threshold for market shares which would trigger future CMA investigations if banks grow above that size - and an automatic ban on any takeover that created a bank bigger than the threshold.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, Miliband will pledge that big banks cannot get any bigger.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Bankers have said to me this would lead to what they call a perverse outcome, that as they approached the maximum size they would dump customers they deemed low quality or loss-making.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It is unclear whether these customers would be able to bank elsewhere.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Labour added that the CMA will be instructed to forge the new rules and order the branch disposals based on three criteria:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>1) The creation of &#34;at least&#34; two new challenger banks &#34;with significant market shares&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>2) Improvements in the price and quantity of lending to small businesses.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>3) Improved service for all customers.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>On Wednesday, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, told the Treasury Select Committee that &#34;just breaking up an institution doesn't necessarily create a more intensive competitive structure... It's not just about one aspect. You need to look at the entire business model and risk profile.&#34;</p>

		           		<p>Investors seem to have taken in their stride Ed Miliband's pledge to break up the big banks and impose a ceiling on their respective shares of the market.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The price of Barclays and Lloyds shares dropped less than 1% and those of Royal Bank of Scotland by a bit more than 2%.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is not desperately significant on a day when the stock market as a whole was largely flat.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So why the lack of shock and awe?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well investors apparently doubt Labour's resolve to do what is necessary to force the disposal of hundreds of branches - and also think the reforms would take many years.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>For example, the soon-to-launch Competition and Markets Authority could not, as currently constituted, simply be instructed to devise a way of creating two new challenger banks from the existing banks in just six months.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Nor could it be told to set a new legal maximum for the size of banks in the same time frame.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So Ed Miliband would have to introduce new competition legislation on taking office - which Labour tells me it would do, but investors believe could not be passed quickly or easily.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And bankers also believe that even if the CMA imposed a new cap on the size of banks, that could be challenged under EU law.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, investors seem to believe that Mr Miliband is posturing to win votes, and would conveniently find a way to abandon the break-up plan after the election.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which, according to Mr Miliband's close colleagues, shows that the City remains a bit short-termist and perhaps naive.</p>

		           		<p>So the good news is that China's economy is growing at a marginally reduced annual rate of 7.7% per annum.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And the bad news is that China's economy is growing at a marginally reduced annual rate of 7.7% per annum.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>What do I mean?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, whether or not you regard China's official economic statistics as beacons of empirical accuracy (few do), it is clear that there's no hard landing in China, no precipitate end of the high-growth era, whose implications (some bad, some good) would be felt the world over.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But there is an argument, which I have spent the last few months investigating in a film for BBC2 (which is finished, and will be broadcast soon-ish), that the current main sources of Chinese growth are unsustainable - and that the longer growth remains at this kind of rate, the more spectacular and damaging the eventual reckoning will be.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>How so?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, the first thing to say is that it's all our fault (I am not being wholly flippant).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Because the big flaws in China's economy worsened in 2008, in the immediate aftermath of a banking crisis which was a Western phenomenon but which hobbled growth and demand almost everywhere.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In particular it undermined China's export-led economic model. When Europe and the US in effect went bust, we no longer wanted to buy all that lovely cheap stuff made in China, so China's economy ground to a halt, prompting the urgent need for another way.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>A very courageous Chinese government might have taken the opportunity to engage in the kind of &#34;demand rotation&#34; that it and the world really needed - namely to put through big reforms which would have encouraged its 1.3 billion people to consume and spend much more.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>This would have involved rapid liberalisation of its financial sector, to provide better returns on investment, and a fundamental loosening of the supply of consumer credit. And there would have been substantial steps towards the establishment of a proper welfare state, which would have obviated the need for the Chinese to save six times what we save (as a share of disposable income).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>If there had been a significant rise in the share of the Chinese economy represented by consumption, from a third to nearer the two-thirds of mature decadent economies such as ours and that of the US, China's long term growth prospects would have been enhanced - and the stagnation of our economies would not have been so elongated, because there would have been much better opportunities for our own exporters.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>However, it wasn't to be.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>China's government took the view that re-engineering on that scale brought excessive risks, in that there undoubtedly would have been a marked deceleration of growth for some time, during the period of structural change, and the risks to political stability would have been too great.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The fear of the Chinese government was that unemployment would have risen to levels in which discontent with economic stewardship might have transmuted into open criticism of the one-party state. The bargain between Communist Party and people - prosperity as the dividend for sacrificing democratic rights - would have been broken.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So instead the government went for an apparently more direct and easy resuscitation - it created the mother of all investment and lending sprees.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>To be clear, in 2007 most economists were even then arguing that China was too dependent on investment, with expenditure on plant, equipment, buildings and infrastructure already 40% of national income, or GDP.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But rather than there being a &#34;rebalancing&#34; away from investment, it actually shot up, to 50% of GDP. There was a splurge on remaking the urban and industrial landscape, more or less unprecedented in history.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Wherever you go in China, you can see the fruits, from the world's tallest skyscrapers and longest bridges, to roads that seem to go nowhere and mind-boggling numbers of unoccupied new homes.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>What's more, those legacies of the Maoist era, the state-owned enterprises, had a new lease of life - on Beijing's orders - creating huge new productive capacity.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That yielded the short term benefit of expanding employment, and the long term cost of killing their profitability, because so much of the new capacity was beyond what the market could bear.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>All of which was a bit short-termist, especially for a government famed for its 10-year plans. But the biggest danger stemmed from how all this investment and expansion was financed.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The government ordered the banks to &#34;open their wallets&#34;. And my goodness how the banks obliged.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And after Beijing became anxious that the growth in direct bank lending was perhaps more rapid than was consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards, the banks showed the kind of creativity that would have made a bonus-bulging City or Wall Street investment banker proud. There was an explosion of lending through &#34;shadow banks&#34;, which were nominally separate from the banking system, but much of the liability was still effectively with the banks.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The consequence was that lending has been rising at an unsustainably fast annual rate of 15% of national income per annum since 2008, so that total debts are now twice GDP, and the total liabilities of the banking system exploded by $15tn over that period.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or as Charlene Chu, late of ratings agency Fitch puts it, just the increment in the balance sheets of Chinese banks since the 2008 crash is equivalent to the aggregate size of US commercial banks, whose balance sheets have grown to that point over a century.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Chu does not think an economy can be weaned off that degree of addiction to debt-fuelled growth without - ahem - there being some kind of shock to the economy.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But even if you thought she was being unduly pessimistic, you would want the rate of lending and investment to grow at least no faster than the economy - because the longer they grow faster than the economy, the greater the danger that eventually the debt burden and the write-offs of lousy investments become unaffordably big.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, the longer that China has the wrong kind of rapid growth, the greater the risk that an eventual crash will muller China and bring contagion to connected financial institutions and economies.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That brings us back to those good and bad GDP figures published today.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>They show that fixed-asset investment (excluding rural households) increased by 19.6% last year, down slightly from 20.6% in the previous year. But - and this matters - investment was up much more than retail sales (13.6% higher) and industrial production (9.7% up).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, China remains hooked on debt-fuelled investment. There is no healthy rebalancing.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Now, the government has announced a 10-year plan, at its recent plenum, to gradually increase the share of consumption in growth, and tilt away from construction and investment.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Will they succeed? How long will it take? And what are the consequences for China and us if they don't?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, in the words of the original Batman and Robin TV series of the 1960s, tune into my BBC2 documentary (in just a few weeks) to find out (sorry for the shameless plug - and see my colleague Linda Yueh's note for more on all this).</p>

		           		<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, who has taken upon himself the role of scourge of big opaque banks and profiteering payday loan companies, is today accused of ignoring a financial sleight of hand on his own doorstep.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>John Ralfe, who would be seen by many as the bane of allegedly reckless pension funds, has written to Archbishop Welby to warn him that the deficit of the Clergy Pension Scheme may have been seriously understated.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Ralfe also complains that he was refused access to the data, and had to obtain it through a backdoor route, which he says is &#34;not a good example of the Church's transparency and openness&#34;.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The Clergy Pension Scheme has 16,400 members, including 5,800 pensioners, and its latest valuation showed a £293m deficit, which seems big, but was only modestly higher than the £263m deficit of 2009.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Ralfe points out that the increase in the scheme's hole would have been much higher - to a substantial £391m - if it had not been for a jump in the discount rate used for calculating the scheme's liabilities.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The important point is that the higher the discount rate, the smaller the liabilities. And the Clergy Pension Scheme increased this rate by 0.5% without - according to Ralfe - giving an explanation for why this was appropriate.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Ralfe calculates that if the deficit had been recognised at that higher £391m, cash-strapped dioceses and parishes would be forced to shell out £90m a year to provide vicars and other church officers with pensions, compared with the 2012 outlay of £69.4m.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He complains that at the synod in November, there was no discussion of the pension hole, because the official view was that the deficit had hardly increased and contributions would therefore rise by less than £3m.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Ralfe says: &#34;If this £21m a year increase had been tabled at the Synod, it seems likely dioceses would have pushed to close the scheme... The Archbishops' advisory group reported in 2010 that only 18 of the 42 dioceses supported sticking with DB [final salary] pensions&#34;.</p>

		           		<p>Just nine months ago, the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, warned Britain's chancellor of the exchequer that he was &#34;playing with fire&#34; by not easing the pace of public spending cuts, at a time when the UK's economy was flatter than the proverbial pancake.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>George Osborne did not budge.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But the International Monetary Fund has. Its latest economic forecast shows the UK as the second fastest growing of the world's big developed economies - with only America, on the IMF's projections, set to grow faster in 2014.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>What's more, the IMF may be forced to revise its projections for the UK higher still, because its forecast of 2.4% GDP growth in the current year is still below that of most economists.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The Bank of England, for example, expects a 2.8% rise in national income.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Embarrassing for the IMF?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>A bit.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But what some will see as perhaps piquant or amusing, this time the IMF would be seen by Mr Osborne as getting it wrong for being less hairshirt about fixing a hole in the public finances than he feels is necessary - when historically the IMF has been accused of being too hairshirt with highly indebted countries.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>That said, not even Mr Osborne is today arguing that the UK economy is back in the pink.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>His position is that the patient is recovering, but that a regimen of public expenditure cuts remains the order of the day (which will not warm the cockles of all).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And there is another thing (well a few things actually). To tell you what you may already know (I am making the heroic assumption that you have been paying attention):</p>
		                      
		           		<p>1) too much of the UK's recovery is arguably based on consumption rather than investment, and is vulnerable to rises in interest rates,</p>
		                      
		           		<p>2) there is a disturbing widening in the deficit between what we buy from the rest of the world and what we sell abroad, and</p>
		                      
		           		<p>3) as yet, the growth is not feeding through to the pounds in our pockets, to our living standards.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It would probably be a little presumptuous, or hubristic, to assume that we are back on a long journey of sustained and sustainable growth, and that there won't be bumps, deviations and reverses.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Oh, and unlike economies currently performing a good deal worse than ours - such as Germany's - UK GDP is still below its pre-crisis peak.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So it will be a few months yet before British national income is back to where it was in the first quarter of 2008, and rather longer before the disposable incomes of British people will have recovered to pre-Crash levels.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>All that said, Britain's recovery is real and is the best we've experienced for years. Who's complaining?</p>

		           		<p>So here I am, again, on the top of a Swiss mountain, surrounded by the world's wealthiest and most powerful.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And, as per normal, I am suffering from mild altitude sickness.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Here is a typical (and true) conversation with a random stranger sitting in the partners' lounge of the Davos congress centre.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;Where are you from? Your badge says India.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;Well, I sit on the board of a big Indian institution, but I am a former minister of a Eurasian state, and I now have US citizenship, but I manage my money from a family office in London.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Yikes. I didn't ask the size of the fortune, but the phrase &#34;family office&#34; speaks to non-trivial sums: the turmoil and wealth-creating opportunities of the globalised world, since the collapse of communism, captured in a social introduction.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And before you ask, I inserted the catch-all &#34;Eurasian&#34; to protect the anonymity of said member of the global plutocracy (them is the rules of the World Economic Forum).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As for the rest of my day so far, I have nattered to a FTSE 100 chairman, two FTSE 100 chief executives, two heads of big City institutions, a Middle Eastern philanthropist, a hedge-fund superstar and a government head.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And all meetings were serendipitous.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So, amidst the hand-wringing about what they all see as the UK's growing isolation from the EU (Davos person is genetically pro-European) and bullishness about the UK's economic recovery, in just four hours I have gathered enough story leads to keep me occupied for some time.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>For a journalist of my eccentric interests, Davos is like being let loose in the sweetshop.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>What is on the minds of these eminences?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, the most interesting conversation so far was an (unusual) on-the-record briefing for a few hacks by Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Why was this gripping (and a bit scary)?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well, he volunteered that Japan's current bad relations with China are redolent of the relationship between Britain and Germany 100 years ago, or shortly before World War 1.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is the sort of thing you would expect clever-clogs commentators to say (in fact they do say this), but it has more impact (ahem) when said by Japan's leader.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And, indeed, he elaborated.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He recognises that - just like Britain and Germany in 1914 - Japan and China are inter-dependent economies, trading partners with huge mutual interests.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Peace would therefore be the bulwark of their prosperity and that of the region.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But he was explicit that he saw the 10% per annum increase in China's defence budget as a provocation.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As for his controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine, there was explanation, but no hint of regret or apology. Mr Abe simply insisted that China was wrong to see him as honouring a small number of &#34;war criminals&#34;. Instead, he was paying respect to the &#34;souls&#34; of millions of other genuine Japanese war heroes.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And, by the way, Japan's title to the Senkaku Islands, which China disputes, is unimpeachable (or so Mr Abe said).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Given that Mr Abe says he wants peace with China and fears there could be &#34;accidents&#34; that shatter it, I asked him if he had a road map or plan to de-escalate the tension</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Not while China pursues its military build-up, he said.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which left me with a hollow feeling that is somewhat characteristic of encounters in this rarefied place.</p>

		           		<p>Goodness me, the prime minister has made the bold judgement that bankers have been sufficiently rehabilitated to appoint a couple of them as his business ambassadors.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As I understand it, the chairman of HSBC, Douglas Flint, and the chief executive of Santander UK, Ana Botin, will on Friday be announced as joining the ranks of business grandees chosen by David Cameron to sell the UK to the world.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is quite something. Since it is a while since the government wanted to be too closely associated with top bankers.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is a nuance here of course. Which is that HSBC and Santander UK are those rarities, banks that got through the banking crisis without needing to be propped up by taxpayers.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As it happens, I've just interviewed the prime minister, who is in Davos lauding the attractions of the UK to overseas companies and investors.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>You can see that interview later on the BBC, on the Six O'Clock News, and at Ten.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He was in ebullient mood, having just come from a meeting with Chinese financial institutions who were - he said - remarkably bullish about the UK's prospects.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And another thing. As you know, the UK is suffering from trade and current account deficits that are large and intractable.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Narrowing that gap hasn't been helped by the wounds - many of them self-inflicted - of our big international banks.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The prime minister is sending a message that he would rather like those wounds to heal.</p>

		           		<p>Even in sclerotic Europe (well that's how we're seen by the Chinese), the global recovery is returning a bit of colour to the cheeks of the prone patient.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>I won't labour the point about the UK's return to semi-respectable growth, although the Chancellor repeated his &#34;it's-work-in-progress&#34; message in a chat with 20 or so business leaders here in Davos this morning.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>However, what George Osborne really wanted from them was that they should beat up the Labour leader for allegedly messing in a dangerous way in the energy and banking markets (although, incomprehensibly, I am told this wasn't a party political point).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And as it happens, Osborne repeated his denigration of the EU as chronically uncompetitive because of its excessive regulation and welfare bills that are high and rising (an analysis the Chinese share, as it happens).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But although the eurozone's revival lags chronically behind that of the US and UK, today's MARKIT survey of purchasing managers shows signs of life in the euro area - at last, some would say.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So here at the World Economic Forum there is growing confidence that it is safer than it has been for many years to take the kind of business risks that are the sine qua non of a sustained recovery.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Even the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, gave what would be called in the City and Wall Street &#34;an investor presentation&#34; - a not-very-subtle call to the world's most loaded investors, corporates and banks to invest in the Islamic republic.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The giant US bank Citi put numbers on the mood with this morning's forecast that global growth would rise from 2.5% last year to 3.3% this year.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So everything's tickety-boo again, and we can dismiss the 2008 crash as a bad dream?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well not quite.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As you know (you do, you do), there is still a massive burden of debt and unfunded future welfare promises bearing down on the long-term growth prospects of most developed economies, including the UK.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And the other thing which really worries all the spectacularly wealthy people here is how they are becoming so much wealthier, minute by minute, than the world's poor.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or at least that is what these plutocrats with a conscience say. How to tackle growing income inequality is one of the big themes of this year's World Economic Forum.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Strikingly, and importantly, the rising inequality is between individuals everywhere, whether in the US, UK, Africa or China.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And it is happening even as the gap between the incomes of nations narrows. According to the IMF, for example, the GDP of African nations collectively will rise faster this year than that of almost any other region.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But even in Africa, a disproportionate share of the fruits accrue to a new class of billionaires and the mega-wealthy.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There are two conventional and contradictory theories of why inequality is so determinedly on the ascendant.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The version preferred by Davos Person is that in a world of globalised, easy-access capital and data, disproportionate rewards accrue to those with marginally greater talents.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>You can see why they like this account - it implies their billions are their just desserts.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The other theory is that nepotism and closed networks rule (OK?) and that there is little equality of opportunity when it comes to access to education and capital, so a smallish cadre of the privileged reinforce their privileges through the generations.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>However, in a way, it doesn't matter which theory you sign up for. At least part of the prescription to roll back the tide of inequality would be the same on both diagnoses - better education for all, better access to affordable finance for all.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is neither controversial or desperately original, although that somehow doesn't mean we are galloping towards an egalitarian future.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And by the way, the fashionable theory here is that technology means that any of us who haven't already made our billions are knackered anyway.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The big chatter here is about the current acceleration in the refinement of artificial intelligence and robotics, which will allegedly see 80% of even quite high-skilled jobs replaced by machines within years.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which would mean that redundancy looms for all jobs that aren't either desperately menial or creative in a sense that robots can't replicate.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>You will be OK if you are a stand-up comedian, and (apparently) it is unlikely it will be cheaper to have a robot clean a bathroom than a human. But many accountants and software engineers, inter alia, should probably fret.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Consider yourself warned.</p>

		           		<p>I have learned that the governor of the Bank of England would like the Treasury to reduce the maximum size of loan that qualifies for a government-backed Help to Buy mortgage from £600,000 to perhaps £350,000 or £400,000.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>I will explain why this matters in a bit. But first, here's a bit of general context.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is a lot of talk here in Davos about how this era of cheap money has pumped up asset bubbles.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In the UK, as you know, that concern focuses on whether the housing market is overheating - which it may be doing in London and the south east of England.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>All of which raises the question whether it is time for the price of money (interest rates) to start being gradually raised from its historically low level in most of the rich developed economies.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is a related issue in the UK, which is whether the pace and nature of the economic recovery - driven to a considerable extent by household consumption - justifies a rise in interest rates.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>My sense is that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is not united on this issue, that some members are moving to the view that a small increase in interest rates would be beneficial sooner rather than later.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is a lot of gossip from informed sources to that effect - that the governor, Mark Carney, who has made it clear in recent months that he would rather keep interest rates at current exceptionally low levels for as long as possible, risks being outvoted.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Against that backdrop, I interpreted last night's interview with Carney, on BBC's Newsnight, as a sign that he fears he may not be able to stave off a rise in the policy rate in coming months.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Because what stood out for me was his emphasis that as and when interest rates rise, those increases will be very small - implying an initial rise of a quarter of a percentage point.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>This sounded like a concession to his more hawkish colleagues - those who favour an earlier rise in rates.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which will not thrill the chancellor, George Osborne, who will want to be confident that the UK's recovery is firmly entrenched before there is any rise in rates.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There is however one thing the chancellor could do which could perhaps stave off an interest rate rise for a bit longer, and that would be to modify his Help to Buy mortgage support scheme.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As I have already mentioned, I am in no doubt that the governor of the Bank of England would like the maximum size of mortgage that qualifies for a Help to Buy loan reduced from £600,000.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The reason is that in doing so, the charge could no longer stick that the Help to Buy scheme is pumping up prices in London and south east England, which is the only part of the UK where there are signs of overheating in the housing market.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>How so?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well the appalling truth, which you know, is that there simply aren't that many low value properties in the capital and its environs. So reducing the maximum from £600,000 would mean that Help to Buy would see reduced take-up in that part of the country.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So those who favour pushing up interest rates to prevent a housing bubble, and in turn reduce both incipient inflation and possible financial instability, could be placated by a reduction of perhaps £200,000 or £250,000 in the maximum Help to Buy loan value.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Would such a modification be embarrassing for the Treasury and chancellor?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Probably only a bit.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Because in practice, Help to Buy is already having more impact outside London, where it is needed most, than inside London.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>I know this based on data about its impact, passed to me by banking sources, who point out three things:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>By the way, when I talk about Help to Buy, I mean specifically the second scheme, aimed at the second-hand market, not the original scheme to encourage house building.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Will the Treasury bite and reduce the maximum value to £350,000 or £400,000?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well all I can say is that the Chancellor seems to be to show no sign of any waning in his admiration for Carney, so there is a fair probability he will heed his advice.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The Bank of England has given me this statement in response to my story on the Governor's position on Help to Buy:</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;The assertion that the governor would like the Treasury to reduce the maximum size of loan that qualifies for a Help to Buy mortgage is completely without foundation.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>For what it is worth, I stand by everything I wrote.</p>

		           		<p>At a lunch for business leaders in Davos, Mark Carney made some remarks which showed that he does not want interest rates to rise for some time yet, even though unemployment is very close to the level where the Bank of England would in theory start to evaluate whether it is time for the cost of money to increase.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The governor of the Bank of England said that the central bank now believes that the unemployment rate consistent with stability in inflation is lower than it believed last summer.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Then it took the view that there might start to be inflationary movements in wages once the unemployment rate fell to 6.5% - which is not to be confused with the 7% threshold for the Bank to start reviewing interest rates as part of its so-called &#34;forward guidance&#34; policy.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Carney said: &#34;It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Although Mr Carney did not say what level of unemployment the Bank now saw as likely to have inflationary consequences, he will be seen as indicating that if he gets his way, the Bank's policy rate will stay at the record low of 0.5% for many months yet.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>I say &#34;if he gets his way&#34; because he is only one of the voting members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, or MPC, and I am told that some members are beginning to think it might be wise to start raising interest rates, albeit gently.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The current unemployment rate is 7.1% - and it has been falling sharply through 2013.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Carney also said: &#34;The level of interest rates necessary to sustain low unemployment and price stability will be somewhat lower than before the crisis.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;In the jargon, the equilibrium real interest rate, which has been negative for much of the period since the crisis, will eventually turn positive again, but it is likely to remain well below historical norms.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The persistence of low interest rates for years to come reflects the mountain of debt that was accumulated in the UK during the boom years - and the fact that non-bank debt in aggregate, namely business, government and household debts, have continued to rise since then.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, has argued recently that for many of the developed economies, real interest rates - interest rates minus the inflation rate - may have to remain negative for many years.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Carney also defended the &#34;forward guidance&#34; policy he introduced in the summer, even though an important element of that guidance, the unemployment threshold, looks set to be breached much earlier than the Bank expected.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He said the Bank's forward guidance had through the autumn given confidence to households and businesses that interest rates would remain low and stable, which had contributed to the current strength of the UK's economic recovery.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Mr Carney said that the Bank would evaluate whether to change elements of its forward guidance in its February Inflation Report.</p>

		           		<p>People often moan that politics and politicians never change, but there has been a big shift in the attitude of the Labour Party in its attitude to big businesses and high earners, from the period when Tony Blair led the Labour party in opposition in the mid-1990s to today's opposition Labour Party.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>When Blair was in charge, I was the FT's political editor. Therefore, I took a particularly close interest in Blair's relations with the big-cheese bosses and plutocrats.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>His calculation was that Labour could not win if it was seen to be opposed to what he defined as aspiration and wealth creation. So most of his waking minutes were devoted to wooing business, especially big business, and creating the impression that a Labour government would raise neither the top rate nor basic rate of income tax.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>The epitome of this policy was his burning ambition - which was only ever half fulfilled - to secure the endorsement of Richard Branson (before the election, the great brander created the impression he was on New Labour's side without actually saying anything explicit).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>New Labour's determination to impose a windfall tax on the privatised utilities might have looked in some way anti-business. But in practice the remuneration and pricing policies of these companies had so alienated most &#34;proper&#34; private-sector business folk that they just about gave the party the benefit of the doubt.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And, by the way, it is reasonable to conclude today that this was conviction politics on the part of Blair, given the colossal amount of money he has made from advising big businesses and multinationals since stepping down as Labour's leader.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>All of which does seem a world away from today's Labour party under Ed Miliband.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He would and does say that he wants to support the growth and proliferation of smaller businesses.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But his plans to impose a price freeze on energy companies, to break up the biggest banks and to raise the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p is angering the boss class, to the extent that quite a few are breaking the habits of a lifetime and making critical public statements.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>So what's changed between 1996 and 2014? Well to state perhaps the most obvious and least interesting distinction, in the spectrum of views that constitute the Labour Party, Miliband appears to be slightly to the left of Blair.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But so much else has changed of an arguably more fundamental sort.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>In an economic sense, the UK was four years into a strong recovery in 1996 and living standards were rising sharply - which may have helped to curb popular resentment, to an extent, of higher earners.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>And in the zone of ideology, Thatcherism was still massively in the ascendant - Margaret Thatcher had shifted the middle ground of politics and converted Blair and the top of New Labour to the idea that economic growth and prosperity were best secured by the unleashing of market forces.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>How different from today. We are in the early months of a recovery and living standards for most people have been squeezed for many years and are not yet improving.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Also the banking crisis of 2008, which triggered the long dark years of recession and economic stagnation, has made respectable again the idea that the private sector cannot always be trusted to deliver optimal economic outcomes for all of us (ahem).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Then there are two other things.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Newspapers, which have a tendency to be hostile to tax rises and intervening in markets, had much bigger circulations in the 1990s than today. And Labour now has the ability through social media to go round them.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But perhaps for me what is most striking is that Labour seems to have calculated that it can win the election by hanging on to the support of LibDem refuseniks, or those marginally to the left of the centre who voted LibDem last time but have been alienated by its participation in the coalition.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>He does not seem interested in eroding the Tories' residual support.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Or to put it another way, Miliband seems to believe he can win the election by standing largely on the left, which is so different from Blair's strategy (and tactics).</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which means that the dividing lines between the two bigger parties do feel much more as they did in the 1970s, rather than in the 1990s.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>What about the actual costs or benefits of raising the top rate of tax, to the Exchequer and the economy?</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Well if I haven't dwelled on these, it is because the evidence is murky.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>After Labour introduced the 50p tax rate just before the last election, there was a huge amount of what is known as income shifting and income converting: bonuses, for example, were brought forward and paid before the new tax bit; income was converted into capital, so that it could avoid income tax; and various other devices were employed to dodge the higher rate, sometimes permanently, sometimes temporarily.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>As for whether it drove wealth creators from the UK, there the facts are even harder to find - a few hedge fund superstars have moved to Switzerland (which not everyone weeps about), and lots of French capitalists have moved to London, to escape President Hollande's even higher taxes.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>There might be a good deal of income shifting and converting again, if the rate went from 45p to 50p, which would reduce the take from the imposition of the higher rate.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>But the amounts of money gained or lost from the tax rise, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said, may be pretty trivial, probably less than a percentage point of the annual hole or deficit in the government's finances.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Which is why what is more interesting about the planned tax rise is what it says about battle lines in politics, and the parties' attitudes to high earners and businesses.</p>

		           		<p>Extracts of the speech to be given by the Labour leader say: &#34;We have to get to the root of the decades-long problem in British banking - too much power concentrated in too few hands.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>&#34;Britain has one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world, with just four banks controlling 85% of small business lending.&#34;</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Ed Miliband will pledge that big banks cannot get any bigger.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>Bankers have said to me this would lead to what they call a perverse outcome, that as they approached the maximum size they would dump customers they deemed low quality or loss-making.</p>
		                      
		           		<p>It is unclear whether these customers would be able to bank elsewhere.</p>
