When it comes to form validation, older browsers don't support the HTML5 required attribute for input elements and the newer browsers give a mixed and sometimes undesirable result when it comes to newer input types like date and range.
Google Chrome tries hard to implement the HTML5 standard for date elements, but in practice it's calender view is nearly unusable, mostly because of the lack of custom date formats.
I have been working on a Javascript library that aims to integrate the HTML5 spec across browsers. It sticks to the spec as clodely as possible and is easy to integrate and not obtrusive.
It couldn't be easier to implement. Just add the Javascript file to your HTML and invoke the plugin function to you form.
$('form').html5form();

Now you will be able to use semantic markup for your forms, including date, number and range attributes.
