I wasn't too excited in the months leading up to the keynote on Monday. But I also wasn't expecting <strong>this</strong>.&#160;<br></p><p></p><p>Don't get me wrong, there are things I very much dislike about iOS 7 so far.&#160; But I can save all of the mushy details for this fall.&#160;</p><p>What keeps crossing my mind is, "This feels like a <strong>brand new thing</strong>. Like a brand new phone, with a brand new screen. But...it's not." I have to keep reminding myself it's not. That right there is good.</p><p>It's an exciting, shiny, new thing. Sure, it's different. Very different. Kind of...alive.</p><p>But hasn't everyone been complaining about Apple not creating anything new? "The same old shit." <strong>Well, here's new shit.&#160;</strong></p><p>This isn't the second coming of the iPad. But so far, I'm seeing a big step in the right direction. It will just take a lot of refining and pixel-perfecting before the leaves start falling off the trees.</p><h3>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."&#160;</h3><h3>—Steve Jobs<em></em><strong></strong></h3><p></p><p>Apple doesn't just do design for the sake of design. There's always a purpose.&#160;</p><p>Have patience.&#160;</p><p><strong>P.S.</strong>&#160;If I hear one more dude <em>who hasn't even used iO</em><em>S 7</em> call it awful because it's "girly," I <strong>will</strong> throat punch him. In the girliest way possible, of course. And trust me: <strong>That</strong> will be awful.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#160;</p>

I know. I, too, prefer to yell as I don't quite have an inside voice, but they can call it whatever they want, because I'm sold.</p><p>Whisper is a group chat client for app.net made by the awesome guys who created <a target="_blank" href="http://getapp.cc/app/592316697">Riposte</a> (currently my ADN iPhone app of choice). And it's beautiful. Since I've been playing around with it a lot lately, I'm becoming more and more enamored with it. It has even <strong>earned a spot on <a target="_blank" href="http://homescreen.me/jamie">my homescreen</a></strong>. Especially since I can launch Riposte from within it. I just switched them out without even thinking about it (which is not very like me).</p><p>Done.</p><p>The app is super fast and works well for big groups as well as one-on-one conversations. You can share pictures and locations (including your own or anywhere you want to meet someone) as well. I definitely see this being used like crazy this next week among developers in San Francisco for WWDC. It's a great convention tool.&#160;</p><p>I would love to use this as our main communication channel for work, too.</p><p></p><p>But, more than anything else, I would love to have this gorgeous app available on the Mac. I would pay good money to be able to use it on my Macbook. Not to mention the possibilities of having this chat for other platforms—like Twitter—really could open up communication in new ways. In new, <strong>better</strong> ways. This is more proof ADN is such a great thing for developers and app innovation.&#160;</p><p>Oh! Did I mention it comes bundled with some badass emoji (called stickers)? That's right. And that's probably the best part. I'm talking Grumpy Cat, Picard, Caruso...pretty much <strong>all things awesome</strong>.&#160;</p><p>By the way, <a target="_blank" href="http://getapp.cc/app/612458307">Whisper is free</a>. So, there's that. They also already updated the app and, let me tell you, probably <a target="_blank" href="http://riposteapp.net/whisper-release-notes.html">the best app release notes I've ever read right here</a> (next to Yelp's).</p><p>Plus, if you get it...THEN WE CAN WHISPER TO EACH OTHER IN OUR OUTSIDE VOICES. I'm <a target="_blank" href="https://alpha.app.net/atjamie">@atjamie</a> on ADN, by the way. If there was ever any doubt.</p><p>But seriously: I can't stop using this app.&#160;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&#160;</p>

Maybe you've heard of it.<strong> </strong></p><p>&#160;<strong>I</strong><strong>t's called nature.</strong></p><p>But let's back up for a moment here. Back to where it all began. Back to the beginning of May.</p><p>My best friend, Erika, had been planning her wedding for a while. She had already figured out her theme, too: succulents. If you don't know <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant">what succulents are</a>, they're a certain type of plant that can survive more arid climates because they store water in their "fatty" leaves. Like cacti. Basically, they're perfect for people like me who don't have time to keep real plants alive...or...can't. Hell, I typically forget to eat throughout the day if I don't set an alarm. Do you think I'd remember to feed something else too? </p><p>Oh. God. My cat! </p><p>BRB... &#160;</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Erika became obsessed. Nearly every day she would send me photos of succulents. I didn't understand it. Now, I don't do the whole Pinterest thing, but I'm sure she had <strong>pin</strong>s all over her <strong>terest&#160;</strong>of random succulent plants too. Then, the wedding favors were delivered to her house.&#160;</p><p>What were the wedding favors, you ask? Shut up. You know they were succulents.&#160;</p><p>So, of course Erika sent me a photo of the wedding favors, of all of the succulents.&#160;</p><p>The conversation went something like this:<br></p>

<p>ERIKA:&#160; These are the wedding favors aren't they amazing?!?!</p><p>ME:&#160; Oh. Oh! What does that one have sticking out of it? It's like...it's like an umbilical cord. Gross.</p><p>ERIKA:&#160; Yeah? Well, now that one's yours.</p><p>(This is why we're best friends.)&#160;</p><p>The wedding was in Florida, so I had flown down for the week. Then I ended up cozying up to that <em>umbilical cord succulent</em> as we were preparing the favors for the reception the next day. </p><p>It was growing on me.&#160;<strong>I guess it was mine.&#160;</strong></p><p>So, I traveled with this living thing back to Cleveland. I even got stopped by TSA at the airport...but they only wanted to ask me what the hell it was.&#160;</p>

<p>I felt like WALL-E carrying this tiny plant with me into the airport. To lunch. To the bathroom. To my gate.&#160;</p><p>It's as if I could hear it calling to me,&#160;"Feed me, Seymour!"&#160;</p><p>But as I finally made it home with this thing, after watching over it, making sure no one stepped on it, making sure it didn't get lost at the airport, or squashed on the plane...I realized I was somehow attached.&#160;</p><p>Dammit.&#160;</p><p>When I got home, I started researching how to better care for it. I found out its name is "crassula dubia." Leave it to me to pick the crass one.</p><p></p><p>I decided it needed a better home. So, I went out and bought potting soil, and a pot, and — what do you know? — fell in love with some cacti at the store too, so I brought those home with me. &#160;</p><p><em>How did this happen?</em></p>

<p>I took all of these new things home, spread them out outside, and went to work. It made me really happy to sit outside and play in the dirt and replant these tiny living things. I don't know why, but it did. Sure, I played in the dirt when I was a kid; but it's different when you're an adult.&#160;</p><p>I don't want to have children and I've never tried my hand at gardening before. I just can't keep things alive; I can't have things depending on me.&#160;<br></p><p>But so far I've kept these alive. <strong>I think there's hope for the hopeless yet.</strong></p><p></p>
