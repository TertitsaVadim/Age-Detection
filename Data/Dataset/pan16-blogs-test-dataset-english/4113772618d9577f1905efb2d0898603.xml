As many times in my life I am re-starting from level zero in order to truly grasp what I want to do.

Still very hard to accomplish nevertheless. A lot of fun too! Important things to say and remember; I have find useful encapsulate body mases to preserve consistency through the whole set of drawings. Reducing to balls every joint and keeping the balls the same size helps a lot. For muscles I used elipses or &uml;beans&uml; between the joint balls. Another thing important to remember is that weight is given by the pose and the pose is pushed further depending on the variation of line weight and &uml;pushing bellies&uml; of this balls and elipses. One part of this circles always have to tend towards where the weight or force is. Finaly, it is better to approach animation thinking in fases of a wave. Where the peak is, is where the force should go. Emotions are better transmited by wave movements. Emotions ARE waves after all.<br /> <br /> Any comments and critics will be appreciated.<br /> <br /> Thanks to all!</p>
