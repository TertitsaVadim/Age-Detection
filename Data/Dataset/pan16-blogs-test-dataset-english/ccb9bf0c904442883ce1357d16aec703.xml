My, how time flies. Today, on the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, take a minute to remember the leprechaun from Mobile, Alabama and how one town completely lost their minds.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nda_OSWeyn8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nda_OSWeyn8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>

Is it like Orbitz or Expedia, where you book the cheapest travel through it? Nope. You can't actually book anything through it.<br /><br />What<a href="http://www.freetraveling.com"> Free Traveling </A>does do is chronicle any rate MISTAKES that hotels make, as in accidentally listing a room that costs $350 for $35! This means that, if you're fast on the draw, you can get a room for very very cheap or even FREE. Nice, huh?<br /><br />Well, it's just gotten better. They now list codes for discounts on airfare too! That's right, these codes can be entered when you're buying airline tickets, and presto, you get an instant 10% off the final price. VERY NICE!<br /><br />If you're traveling as much as me, you'll take any discount you can get, believe me.

		<document id="97402bb900dd5a17beabeb588ed2a77e" url="http://hellifiknowblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-late-night-tv-was-really-something.html"><![CDATA[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is a gigantic piece of crap.<br /><br />There, I've said it.<br /><br />I've watched it for some time now, largely due to the fact that there's nothing else on at 3am (when it repeats from its 11:30pm slot), and it is just terrible. I've had the chance to really reflect on why it's so bad, and while I could easily single out the horrendously repetitive band, the toothless jokes, the lame sidekicks, the endless gratuitous pandering to the audience, and the single worst comedy skits ever in the history of television, these are not the main reason why it's so bad.<br /><br />That reason is a remarkably simple one: there are NO surprises on the show ever. Jay Leno clearly knows all the questions and all the answers in advance, and all spontaneity is crushed by this rush to consolidate everything into an easily digestible pablum. Even the surprises on the show are planned within an inch of their lives and there is absolutely no hiding it. It's honestly the closest thing we have to television programming for androids. It makes me insane. I yell at the tv screen constantly, demanding that the show try harder, but to no avail.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I have a decent working knowledge of what late night TV used to be, and how dangerous it could be, that it makes me so disdainful of what it's become.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://quietfm.com/Blog/Images/Miles03.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://quietfm.com/Blog/Images/Miles03.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Tonight I was over at the lovely blog <a href="http://quietfm.com/jcblog/?p=159">Jazz And Conversation</a>, where it was reminiscing about the first television appearance of the Miles Davis Quintet. The year was 1955, and the band made its debut on The Tonight Show, then hosted by Steve Allen. Allen, an accomplished musician on his own, seems very nervous about the band's appearance, constantly referencing how they might put off <I>"fans of Guy Lombardo"</i> and also bringing up Miles winning the Down Beat poll that year for best trumpeter. <br /><br />But honestly, Allen had nothing to worry about. After all, this is the quintet's greatest lineup with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Philly Joe Jones on drums and Paul Chambers on bass. The band rips through <I>"Max Is Making Wax"</i> and then gets all sweet on <I>"It Never Entered My Mind"</i>. It's a great performance, filled with risk, for both the band and the show.<br /><a href="http://www.quietfm.com/Music/miles1955.mp3"><br />Take a listen to it here!</a><br /><br />But, as strange as Miles must have seemed to non-jazz fans in 1955, they surely cannot compare to the shock that audiences must have felt the year before as Perez Prado, the king of mambo, appeared for the first time on <i>"The Spike Jones Show"</i>. <br /><br />As if it wasn't enough for audiences to be overpowered with the band's primal latin rhythms and Prado's inability to speak any English, his band engages a battle of the bands with Spike Jones's orchestra, in what is surely one of the strangest musical moments in television. Plus, Billy Barty appears from nowhere and gets in a fight with a tall guy in a sombrero!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.timfowlar.com/barty2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px;" src="http://www.timfowlar.com/barty2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />An incredible event, take a look below!

In a newly signed deal, the U.S. space agency will trade facilities and services with Branson’s company and explore further collaboration possibilities.  <br /><br />Virgin Galactic has exclusive rights to the spacecraft technologies of Burt Rutan’s <a href="http://www.scaled.com/">Scaled Composites</a>, whose SpaceShipOne was the first private craft to reach outer space. SpaceShipTwo, currently under construction, is due to begin testing next year; a rocket called (and I am not making this up) <i>“The Mothership”</i> boosts it through the atmosphere.  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/gallery/albums/flight_general/316_from_ex_800.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/gallery/albums/flight_general/316_from_ex_800.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />In the partnership, NASA will share technology, expertise and research facilities with Virgin; Virgin will let NASA test equipment and train astronauts onboard SpaceShipTwo.  <br /><br />NASA and Virgin Galactic have expressed interest in mutual exploration of space suits, heat shields, rocket motors, and hypersonic vehicles (aircraft capable of traveling at least five times the speed of sound). Unlike the currently planned SpaceShip travel, which basically involved parabolic flight up and down again, hypersonic travel would be geared toward crossing longer distances - for example, covering the distance between New York and London in less than two hours (hello!), or about half the Concorde’s supersonic travel time.  <br /><br />Hypersonic travel will run into all the environmental and noise issues that Concorde encountered and isn’t likely to happen soon (or soon enough, if you’re me). Still, the new deal with NASA gives a lot more credence to Branson’s hopes of opening space travel to, if not the entire traveling population, at least a larger segment of it.  <br /><br />Man! Sign me up! Can we do the same thing to my car too? You would not believe the schedule that I have tomorrow….<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.fansedge.com/Images/Product/33-54/33-54112-F.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.fansedge.com/Images/Product/33-54/33-54112-F.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>

For the most part, we live in the shadows and never try to steal the spotlight. This is true.<br /><br />HOWEVER!<br /><br />Man, what a week it has been to prove that theory wrong! Sound people have lost their minds!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.eurweb.com/images/brice_carrington(2007-with-lion-med).JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="http://www.eurweb.com/images/brice_carrington(2007-with-lion-med).JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />First, there was Brice Carrington. Brice is a Hollywood sound effects guy, who's name was supplied to a reporter for consideration for an article about him. Brice had a <a href="http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur31441.cfm">quite a story to tell, too</a>.<br /><br />Brice had come up from humble beginnings, selling records at swap meets and then eventually was able to get his foot in the door as a sound effects person.<br /><br />He had received 3 commemorative Oscars for <I>“King Kong,” “Ghost and the Darkness,”</i> and <I>“Jurassic Park.”</i>  He has created sound effects for 41 blockbuster films, including <I>"Jurassic Park 3", "Blade, The Blood Hunt", "Rush Hour 2", "Van Helsing", "Superman Returns", "Spiderman"</i>, and the <i>"Mummy Returns"</i> sequels.<br /><br />It was Brice Carrington who gave King Kong his roar, the T-Rex and other dinosaurs their menacing sound in the movie <I>"Jurassic Park"</i>, put the hiss in <i>"Snakes on a Plane"</i>, the swoosh in Superman’s flight and the swirling sound in Spiderman’s web-shooting.  Carrington is the man behind the pops, bangs, booms and blasts of the firepower in <i>"Miami Vice", "True Lies", "The Fantastic Four"</I> and <I>"The Incredible Hulk"</i>, etc.<br /><br />Wow, right? This guy is clearly a Hollywood sound legend.<br /><br />Only one problem. <B>It was all completely untrue! This man had never done of those things that he had claimed, he just made it all up!</B><br /><br />Slowly, other sound designers began to realize that this guy was claiming credit for their work! When the reporter contacted Brice to confront him with these claims, he responded with this admission:<br /><br /><I>"I am Brice Carrington. I am writing this note to address comments made about me and to state some facts about my work. All the statements made that say directly that I have NEVER worked on a film or have won an academy award for sound is absolutely true. I have never worked on a motion picture nor have I ever won an academy award. <br /><br />The fact is, I am a sound designer, and I make recreations of sounds found in films and sell them to the public through a brand called Ultimate FX. I am completely responsible for all the misleading or incorrect statements made about me in the press. My effort was to create press for the brand Ultimate FX, which I am the author. I did this foolishly. This is a library where I have made my OWN versions of movie sounds. I have no association with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. I commemorate the Oscars by creating a version of the main characters in films that win Oscars. Like in Jurassic Park, we make a T-Rex using hogs in water, lion growls, a lawn mower and elephant roars. That is My version. I sell this and other sounds complete with the stems to consumers. This is a lawful enterprise, but misleading the public or allowing mis-characterizations is wrong. <br /><br />I am issuing an apology for making all of the misleading or mischaracterizations of my work. I apologize to those in the sound industry and the makers of the original works and studios that distribute them for this offense. To correct this, I will ask for retractions were appropriate in the press. I will also refrain from any further public comments and allow the brand and the product to speak for itself through traditional means of sales and marketing.  To those in the sound industry and those specifically I have offended, you have a right to be upset, and I offer my sincere apology. I am sorry that you had to spend one minute of your time addressing this. b"</i><br /><br />Well, at least he came clean about it, but still! That takes balls, kid.<br /><br /><B>BUT!</B> That's <B>NOTHING</B> compared to the balls of sound mixer Michael Minkler. Minkler, along with his two colleagues Willie Burton and Bob Beemer, won the Oscar this week for their mixing of <I>"Dreamgirls"</i>. Among the people who they beat out for this award was sound mixer Kevin O'Connell, who had been nominated for his mixing of <I>"Apocalypto"</i>. O'Connell had recently gotten a lot of press as he's the Susan Lucci of sound mixers: he's been nominated 19 times for an Oscar without ever winning. <b>19 TIMES!</B> Who can't empathize with that?<br /><br />Well, clearly, Michael Minkler had heard enough about this by the time <a href="http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_popmachine/2007/02/oscar_backstage_1.html">he reached the press room backstage with Burton and Beemer</a> after he had won his Oscar. <a href="http://oscar.com/video/index?channel=5173">A question was thrown to the trio</a> about what advice they had for the losing Kevin O'Connell. While Burton and Beemer had conciliatory things to say -- <I>"Hang in there, Kevin, you'll get your chance,"</i> Burton said -- Minkler's words were the opposite. <i>"I think Kevin should go away with 19 nominations, and find another line of work."</i> he said without cracking a smile. <i>"We work really hard, and if we stumble upon an award, we are so grateful. I just wonder what Kevin's trying to do out there by trying to get an award by using sympathy. And Kevin's an okay mixer, but enough's enough about Kevin."</i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.eonline.com/redcarpet/oscars2007/blog/index2.jsp">Reporters have a hard time </a>trying to figure out whether Minkler is serious or not. Turns out he was.<br /><br />But wait! Is Kevin O'Connell there so we can ask him for a response? No, he's not! Where is he?<br /><br />Wait for it.<br /><br />That's right. <B><a href="http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2007/03/after_mothers_d.html">He's with his dying mother.</a></B> That's right, his mother who was on her death bed, and <b>died immediately following the Oscars telecast</B>.<br /><br /><B>BOOM</B> would be the sound that I would put here.<br /><br />O'Connell responded the following morning through email: <I>"As you may or may not know, my mother Skippy passed away on Sunday night right after the Oscars. I was holding her in my arms when she died. I was not made aware of Mr. Minkler's comments until Monday morning. I have not seen them personally and at this point I have no intention of looking at them or reading about them. I'll get back to you when I get that far down on my list of what is important to me. Take care, Kevin."</i><br /><br />Certainly a dignified response. Other sound designers remain completely shocked and aghast at this whole thing. O'Connell's sound mixing partner for  <I>"Apocalypto"</i>, Greg P. Russell, was pissed to say the least <a href="http://www.incontention.com/2007/02/greg_p_russell_responds_to_mic.html">as he spoke to Incontention.com</a> about whether or not Minkler was serious about his comments:<br /><br /><I>"He was absolutely sincere with that BULLSHIT. That man has lost whatever respect he had from a ton of people. Kevin, mind you, left the ceremonies right after our award and went to the hospital where his mother passed away in his arms at 11:32 pm. As if Kevin didn't have enough to deal with. He wakes up to this bullshit."<br /><br />"It's been a really weird couple of days. I've been fielding all the calls because Kev has been out. The head of our studio came in to say he blasted Minkler for his assault. I even kicked myself for being congratulatory that night. Minkler said to me when I congratulated him that I was always a classy guy and he appreciated that a lot. Integrity is something that means everything to me and this man has absolutely NONE. He stood backstage representing the entire Sound Community in front of the world, only to disgrace us all."</i><br /><br />OH, LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU, MY FRIENDS. There is one rule in Hollywood that you must never never break. That rule is BE NICE TO EVERYONE PUBLICLY, even if they're screwing you. Especially if they're screwing you. Because you never know.<br /><br />You never, never know.

Narration is provided by pioneer radio announcer Alois Havrilla. <br /><br />These soundies were short musical filmclips that were played in jukeboxes in the thirties and forties. The device that played them used a mirror. The films were made in reverse and then their mirror images were projected to the viewers.<br /><br />You can find this film as part of the truly fantastic DVD that's included in RCA's <I>"The Centennial Collection"</i> CD, that's now out of print but still can be picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Centennial-Collection-Duke-Ellington/dp/B0002KQRZ0/ref=sr_1_70/104-0577900-5258349?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1172827607&sr=1-70">here</a>. I bought this cd for a production of <I>"Born Yesterday"</i> that I was doing at Milwaukee Repertory, but spent most of my free time watching this DVD, which is fantastic.<br /><br />AND CHECK THIS OUT! Also featured on the DVD is this soundie of Duke's <I>"Cottontail"</i>, titled <I>"Hot Chocolates"</I> features some <B>ASTOUNDING</B> dancing by Whitey's Lindy Hoppers! Watch this and see if their dancing doesn't blow your mind!<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3HIXxbs2gE0"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3HIXxbs2gE0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br /><br />Cast:<br />Duke Ellington Orchestra featuring Ben Webster<br />Whitey's Lindy Hoppers (In order of appearance):<br />William Downes and Frances "Mickey" Jones<br />Norma Miller and Billy Ricker<br />Al Minns and Willa Mae Ricker<br />Ann Johnson and Frankie Manning<br /><br />The group known as <I>"Whitey's Lindy Hoppers</i> that appears in this soundie was also known as the <I>"The Harlem Congaroos"</i>. They were the undisputed stars of all the groups of Whitey's dancers. After completing the filming of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olrL12XZuq0">Hellzapoppin'</a>, the group had a contract to do a second film for Universal Studios. However, Whitey received an offer for them to perform in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, and decided he did not want his dancers to wait around for a script that was offbeat enough to incorporate the dancers. Such scripts had proven to be few and far between in the past. <br /><br />In order to break the contract, Whitey agreed to make this soundie, which was an enormous hit throughout the United States. The bombing of Pearl Harbor took place while the Harlem Congeroos were in Rio, and they were unable to get back home to the United States after their 6-week engagement was over.<br /><br />They spent 6 months working to make enough money to secure their safe passage back to the USA and finally managed to fly back to Florida, where they arrived with no money in their pockets to make the trip back to New York. In Miami they discovered that the soundie of <I>"Hot Chocolates"</i> was a big hit and was on every jukebox! They found employment with a nightclub owner who capitalized on the popularity of this soundie by advertising that he had the <I>"Hot Chocolates in Person</i>!"<br /><br />All I know is that the peeople dancing in that video are made of elastic. There's simply no other explanation. They have to be.

Pure and simple. Either that or people keep confusing Sanjaya with Halle Berry, which is actually not so impossible to believe.

The phone calls!<br /><br />Now I hear what you're saying. <I>"Lindsay, what can I do? I call and I call and just  keep getting the damned busy signal. I'm a victim of circumstance! What can I do?"</i><br /><br />Look, you got a computer, whaddya think it's made for? That's right, manipulating reality to bend to your will!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.dialidol.com/asp/images/productbox3.gif"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://www.dialidol.com/asp/images/productbox3.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Introducing <a href="http://www.dialidol.com">Dial Idol</a>, the new computer software specifically designed for speed-dialing Americal Idol and shows of the same ilk (i.e. Dancing With The Stars, So You Think You Can Dance, Is There Nothing You Won't Watch?, etc.). <br /><br />This is not a joke, this is a real piece of software. <a href="http://www.dialidol.com">According to the website</a>, it works like this:<br /><br /><I>- You download DialIdol software onto your computer. The software is 100% free & safe.  <br /><br />- DialIdol uses your phone & phone modem to automatically speed dial votes for your favorite contestants. <br /><br />- DialIdol records the result of every call, a vote or a busy signal, then submits this data anonymously to DialIdol.com. DialIdol measures the busy signal to determine which Idols are getting the most votes, based on the results it can automatically direct your votes to one of your favorite Idols, but not necessarily your favorite.<br /><br />- DialIdol.com receives results from people all over the country and uses the busy/vote ratio to produce a prediction.</i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.dialidol.com">According to the website</a>, DialIdol was 87% accurate for season 5 of American Idol and has accurately predicted the winner of every show it has covered.<br /><br />PLus, they post constant updates to <a href="http://www.dialidol.com/asp/predictions/Predictions.asp">their predictions of who they think will stay on and who will be booted off</a>. They can even tell <a href="http://www.dialidol.com/asp/predictions/GeoPredictions.asp">what states voted for what contestants</a>! (Memo to Sanjaya: head south when the inevitable happens...)<br /><br />The only downside: it only works on Windows computers. Well, that, and the fact that you have no life due to your endless obsession over this show in the first place.<br /><br />Not that I'm judging...

This next post is not exactly NSFW, but if you have those kinds of issues, you might just glance around before going further, or you may have some splainin' to do otherwise.<br /><br />So we all know what the internet is really for, which is porn, of course. But what is porn exactly anyway? Traditionally, it's images of people having sex, but in this high tech world we live in now, well....let's just say things have gotten a little more complicated.<br /><br />Which is why something like the website <A HREF="http://www.beautifulagony.com/feck_subaff/redirect.php?id=eee88122" target='_blank'>Beautiful Agony </a>is kinda refreshingly simple and perfect, if you think about it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.beautifulagony.com/feck_subaff/redirect.php?id=eee88122"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://www.beautifulagony.com/public/promotional/banners/beautifulagony_008.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />OK, so the premise is pretty simple: it's videos of people masturbating. However! You can only see them from the neck up! That's right, no nudity, just their face. That's it. These are not professional actors, these are just real people in real places. Men and women. Separately, and occasionally together. They are not paid for their performance.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, there's also a section called <I>"Confessions"</i> where the people tell what the circumstances were when they made the video.<br /><br />What's it all like? Well, it's a wide variety of things, as you can imagine. It's occasionally sexy, it's occasionally bizarre, it's occasionally <I>"Jesus, what the hell is going on down there?"</i>. It's an experience, let me tell you.<br /><br />Since I first experienced this concept through a music video by a band from Columbus, Ohio called <a href="http://www.thesunwebsite.com/">The Sun</a>, I'm gonna put that video here first. While I'm on the fence about the music, the editing is kinda great, and it's a pretty compelling thing to watch.<br /><br /><center><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-ifFuRGDNX8"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-ifFuRGDNX8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></center><br /><br />OK, now that you've seen that, here's what it's really like in context. Don't say I didn't warn you! Choose your format below the picture.<br /><br /><center><A HREF="http://www.beautifulagony.com/feck_subaff/redirect.php?id=eee88122" target='_blank'><IMG SRC="http://beautifulagony.com/preview/0104/0104.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="325" BORDER="0" ></A><br><font face=verdana size=1><br /><a href="http://beautifulagony.com/preview/0104/0104_promo.wmv" target='_blank'> play windows media</a><br><br /><a href="http://beautifulagony.com/preview/0104/0104_promo.mov" target='_blank'> play quicktime</a><br><br /><A HREF="http://www.beautifulagony.com/feck_subaff/redirect.php?id=eee88122" target='_blank'>beautifulagony.com</A><P></font><br /></center>
