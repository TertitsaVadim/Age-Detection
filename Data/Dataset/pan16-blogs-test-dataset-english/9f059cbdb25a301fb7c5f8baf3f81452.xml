There&#8217;s a dream that I&#8217;ve knit, A place where trees-dance and sing. The sun above your head, Shines the light into your soul.

Presidents, prime ministers, policemen, detectives, etc are the known and everyday heroes. Mothers, fathers, siblings, friends and teachers are the social heroes.

Even the most imperfect of us have a strange craving, lust, for perfection. Greed – is what it is. The greed to feel, live, give, get and be better.
