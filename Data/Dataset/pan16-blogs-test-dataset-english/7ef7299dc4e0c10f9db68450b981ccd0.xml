The JAGS project started as a full feature alternative for the Linux platform. Here are some instructions for getting started First install the [&#8230;]

If for whatever reason you need to implement such algorithm perhaps you will save some time reading the walkthrough I did. First you must be sure that LDA is the algorithm you are looking for. From a corpus of documents you [&#8230;]

That is, all lines conform to a fixed schema where each line represents a record and each record has several columns of different types. Your objective is to parse and fill a data structure like this [&#8230;]

SBT has evolved and the new version differs from the 0.7.7 instructions. There is a Github repository with the updated version for SBT 0.11.2. Download the sbt jar and create the script as it is explained here Create the project [&#8230;]

I&#8217;m a big fan of Test Driven Development but it is a technique that is difficult for me to apply to the numerical or algorithmic domain. In order to make sure that the code I write is correct what I&#8217;m doing is the Oracle [&#8230;]

First I though that since those files came from a Hadoop cluster I should write a MR job to do the task. But since recoding ids needs [&#8230;]

In order to have a better understanding of the technique I&#8217;ve reproduced the example of section 10.14.1 California Housing in the book The [&#8230;]

Maybe you are interested in the distance between objects in an Euclidean Space or just the number of attributes or features they share. If you need to perform each comparison, you&#8217;ll need to perform [&#8230;]

I came back home with lots of useful insights although to get those gems I had to go through lots of boring to death presentations. Hey guys, presenting to an audience doesn&#8217;t [&#8230;]
