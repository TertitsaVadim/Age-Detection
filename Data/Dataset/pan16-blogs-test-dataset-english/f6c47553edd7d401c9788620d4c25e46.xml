Imagine my surprise when a CEO opened his mouth and out came a high pitched voice that didn't fit my image of the head of a large corporation. Obviously, he was already at the top and he was otherwise very well spoken and didn't need voice lessons for success. My point is that presenters, like actors, should know </span></span><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">what they sound like</span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"> and have themselves filmed, analyzed, directed, and led in any way they can to sound and look good.

I remember giving a talk not too long ago and apparently my choice of stories didn't go over well with that particular audience. At that time, I hadn't pre-planned to have alternative anecdotes, so I hurried through the talk and vowed to be better prepared the next time and to know my audience better. However, I did listen to the audience and was able to cut off the potentially offensive stories. I could have fallen flat on my face instead of just sounding bad (a small consolation).</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p><span style="color:windowtext;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">To get up and talk in front of groups, big and small, takes a good amount of </span></span><i><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">will power and lots of bravery</span></span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">; which leads to my last point.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></p><p><span style=""><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">To put on a good presentation, you have to have </span></span><i><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">common sense</span></span></span></i><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">.

Common sense tells us that almost no one can spend just an hour or two writing and practicing the delivery of a presentation and sound great. As actors do, presenters must take the time to hone their set of skills to put on a good show and, if you feel that you need to be prodded and prepared to look good, call upon us to work alongside you.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><br /><br /></span></span><span><strong><em><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">Abbe Buck is Principal Consultant of </span></span><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.highviz.net/"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">HighViz Consulting Group</span></span></a></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">, a boutique marketing and public relations firm she founded in 1999, which started by specializing in promoting and developing potential opportunities for small, disadvantaged and minority businesses, with a special focus on Native American entities and associations.</span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"> She can be reached via</span></span></em></strong></span><span style="color:black;"><strong><em><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"> </span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">e-mail at</span></span><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"> </span></span><a href="mailto:highviz@highviz.net"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">abbebuckpr@aol.com</span></span></span></a></span></em></strong><strong><em><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">.</span></span></em></strong><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"> </span></span></span></span><span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:small;"><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></p></span></o:p></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><span></span></span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';"><br /></span><span style="font-size:78%;"><span style="font-size:78%;color:#000000;"><b><a class="a80321211842501-article_printer_link" href="http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_print_view.cfm?this_id=374499&amp;u=worldwit&amp;issue_id=000075580&amp;show=F,T,T,T,F,Article,F,F,F,F,T,T,F,F,T,T"><b><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'trebuchet ms';">[PRINTER FRIENDLY VERSION]</span></b></a></b></span></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td><td valign="top" align="middle" width="5" bgcolor="#ffffff"><img height="1" src="http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/empty.gif" width="5" /></td><td valign="top" align="middle" width="1" bgcolor="#ffffff"><img height="1" src="http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/empty.gif" width="1" /></td><td valign="top" align="middle" width="5" bgcolor="#e5e1e7"><img height="1" src="http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/empty.gif" width="5" /></td><td valign="top" width="161" bgcolor="#e5e1e7"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" width="100%" bgcolor="#e5e1e7" border="0"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#e5e1e7"><h2 class="title">SNAPSHOT -

By Chris Hastings, Arts  and Media Editor<br />Last Updated: 2:02am BST<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"> 31/03/2008</span><br /><br />She might be just  months away from her 50th birthday, but Madonna is proving she's still the  ultimate Material Girl when it comes to making money from her music.<br />The  singer, who is the most successful female recording artist in history, has  earned millions with her new album Hard Candy - even though it does not go on  sale until next month.<br /><br /><strong>Material girl: Madonna is the most  marketing savvy musician in the world<br />She has signed lucrative contracts with  major companies including Vodafone, Unilever and Fuji, which will use her music  to sell products from hairspray to mobile ­phones. The deals, which involve more  than half the tracks on the album, have not only earned the London-based mother  of three a not-so-small fortune, they will ensure her album receives free global  publicity ahead of its release</strong>.<br />Madonna's deal with Vodafone means  the network's customers will be able to listen to seven tracks one week before  the album's worldwide release on April 28. <strong>It is the first time an  artist has launched an album on a mobile phone.<br /></strong>Her new single, 4  Minutes, which features Justin Timberlake, is already being used in a commercial  for Unilever's Sunsilk hair care range. The advertisement, which premiered  during the American football Super Bowl, is set to go global next month. It  includes more than a dozen images of her at different stages of her career. The  track will also feature in Timberlake's film Get Smart.<br />Madonna has also  licensed Miles Away, expected to be the album's second single, as the theme for  a drama called Change on Japan's Fuji TV.<br />In a move that is likely to  infuriate some fans, the eagerly awaited video for 4 Minutes, with Madonna and  Timberlake, will make its debut online rather than on MTV.<br />John Reid, the  president of Warner Music Europe and vice-chairman of Warner Music  International, Madonna's label, said: "<strong>It's not about upfront payments,  it's about selling the product. She is a very smart businesswoman who wants to  sell a lot of albums.<br />"These companies want their customers to know about  their links with Madonna.</strong> They are going to promote the deals and her  music online and in extensive television, radio and press adverts."<br />He added:  "If it all goes to plan then there is no reason why other acts shouldn't strike  similar deals."<br />Madonna is not the first artist to make her work available to  advertisers, but past commercials have tended to feature songs only after they  have been released.<br />Claire Beale, the editor of Campaign, the advertising  industry's trade paper said: "<strong><span style="color:#cc0000;">These deals  prove that Madonna is the most marketing-savvy musician in the world. She's a  case study of what great marketing is.<br /></span></strong>"Using advertisements  to promote a new single in advance of its release is very shrewd  indeed."<br />Stuart <em>Clarke, the talent editor of Music Week, said: "When you  first hear about 4 Minutes being used </em><strong><em>for a Sunsilk campaign  you think 'how tacky'. You then see the advert and you realise what a brilliant  idea it is.<br /></em></strong><span style="color:#cc0000;">"It is as much an  advert for her and her music as it is for the product she is supposed to be  selling. No one else could get away with that."<br /></span>The song 4 Minutes has  already entered the UK charts at number seven on downloads alone. It is expected  to enter the top five today, even though the video still has not been seen and  the record has yet to released.<br /><strong>Gennaro Castalodo, a spokesman for  HMV, said: "Madonna knows it's not just about reaching her own fans, who are  going to buy the record  anyway."</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family:courier new;">You go, material  girl</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family:courier new;"></span></strong><br /><br /></div></div>

This unique offer provides the  opportunity for promising on-demand companies and organizations to kick off a  value-based trial PR campaign with a senior-level Public Relations Practitioner.  This includes working out the beginning concept phase to a starting campaign for  each potential client.<br /><br />In addition, HighViz is offering to consult with  those who are interested in taking the “Challenge”, taking the customer step by  step through case studies of public relations concepts. “This is how to put high  visibility to a business entity’s greatest advantage” Abbe Buck, HighViz’s  Principal Consultant and Lead Publicist explains, “By learning what has worked  for others who have successfully used public relations promotion techniques, the  business who must promote to grow will have a running start in future,  innivative, viral PR planning.”<br /><br /><strong>HOW THE 24/7 PR-PROMO CHALLENGE  WORKS</strong><br /><br />What is the HighViz PR Promo  Challenge?<br /></span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">HighViz asks</span><a name="7"><span style="font-family:arial;"> to have those who would like to  consider hiring us to put them to the test by asking the team to come up with  ideas for their businesses within a business day's time. Abbe Buck also notes,  "If HighViz can come up with a starter road map toward a promotional campaign  and a strategy for marketing traction, we will do all that we can to earn [our]  customer's business. As WWII and adopted HVPR mascot Rosie the Riveter says "WE  CAN DO IT!" --and we already have." </span></a><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Past Performance: Buck cites work that has been done  for clients in this fashion for the ASSYST, USO of Metropolitian Washington,  Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, Information Experts, Molen Enterprises  IT, Lani Silver, (author), David Aaker Motivational Speaker, BoardBoost,  Sarbanes Oxley Seminars, and more.<br /><br />HighVizPR’s <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">24/7 PR – PROMO Challenge</span></strong> works with an  on-demand concept used within Fortune 500 companies such as IBM. HVPR asks that  a form is completed on their website. Once the form is completed, HighViz will  contact the marketing management who made the PR Challenge request. At this  point, HighViz will do an assessment of the PR campaign needs of the  organization, (normally a $1500 value). After the evaluation is completed, it  will be presented to the organization, with suggestions, and a suggested “BRAND”  or “CONCEPT” to put to use WITHIN ONE BUSINESS DAY (24 HOURS)<br /><br />“In  starting out with our current clients, the 24/7 "PR PROMO CHALLENGE” has worked  well because as we thrive on deadlines, we can also share in the customer’s  sense of urgency to bring their ideas to fruition and their services “to market”  , HighViz's Buck says. "We want to be ‘<strong><em>challenged</em></strong>’ by  our customers to go the extra mile. We need these challenges! In an  information-packed society, every business, from a 'mom and pop' to a major  corporation, must have the opportunity to show who they are, what they provide,  why they are in business. It is our job to help them showcase their best  attributes.”<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">To take the 24/7 PR PROMO  CHALLENGE, visit the HighViz site www.highviz.net and fill in the ________blank form, or e-mail <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">highviz@highviz.net</span> </span></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><br /><br /></span><span style="font-family:arial;"># #  #<br /><br /></span><span style="font-family:arial;"><strong>About HighViz  Consulting Group</strong><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Short for "High Visibility", boutique PR and  marketing firm HighViz Consulting Group, specializes in raising awareness for  companies and organizations.

A publicist gets press coverage (in all types of  media) for their clients. Many times an Information Officer or a Business  Development Manager may perform many of the same duties as publicists, only they  respond passively to inquiries about promotion (they seek corporate function, or  sales may be the bottom line). At HighViz, we believe that a true publicist  actively seeks an interested audience in almost any venue (from a trade  publication to the internet), and is, in effect, selling the image, the “brand”  through marketing to the media.<br /><br />2. The publicist is often the middleman  between the high-profile personality or an entrepreneur with a new service or  product, and members of the media. The HighViz Publicist usually wants their  clients to receive positive acclaim, but many publicists surveyed by our own  marketers have noted the old adage that “the only bad publicity is no  publicity.” As politicians and captains of industry require a little more  specific ‘spin’ on their press-they want to be seen as forward-looking and  confident, we have found that a smaller or mid-range company is seeking more  permanent exposure in the very same fashion as they continue to grow.<br /><br />3.  Publicists also perform damage control, attempting to counteract any undesirable  press coverage the client receives. This position as “last line of defense” is  what distinguishes the adequate publicist from the extraordinary one. Good  publicists can turn scandal into opportunity and create valuable  name-recognition for their clients. At HighViz, we have found that in an  uncertain society (the faster things move, the more facts must be checked!)  <em>“Relationship Management” is damage control, as we strive to either defend a  client, or position them in the most favorable light possible.</em><br /><br />4.  Publicists don’t only work for the famous. Our clients at HighViz might include  a little-known person or industry and we create reasons for them to receive  press coverage. In a case where a company desiring publicity is hampered by its  “esoteric nature or technical jargon”, such as with an attorney speaking of  corporate governance or Information Technology pertaining to a top Government  Intelligence agency must be explained, the publicist must translate its  positions into easily understandable language without losing its intended  message or appeal.<br /><br />5. THE DAILY GRIND (or a typical day at HighViz  Consulting Group): A major part of HighViz’s publicist’s day is spent writing  press releases, creating press packets, launching websites and web simulcasts,  which have photos and information about the publicized person or company.  Publicists spend a lot of time on the phone. As we put in long hours, we  actually thrive under hectic conditions, as we must adhere to strict deadlines  which coincide with publicity events, as we work with a magazine for the launch  of a type of business practice or a new product in comparison to the release of  a movie or the publishing of a book.<strong> It is HighViz’s Job #1</strong> --  to ensure that we will get the appropriate information to all media (from  newspaper to web simulcast) in time for the event they are generating publicity  for, such as a record release or automotive sale, or a top-flight seminar.  HighViz is always available for comment (even when that comment is “no comment”  at all!) In this, we always remain friends with the media, no matter how  demanding the desires of both clients and the reporters on whom they depend (and  trust us, we love this stuff!)<br /><br />So do you wonder, at the end of the day,  do we go to the hottest parties in town, the ones for our clients at a movie  premiere or a seminar, or at the National Press Club, The Omni Shoreham, the  Mark Hopkins? (---we do attend, if you ask us to!).<br /><br /><br />Here is what we  do at HighViz…..<br /><br /><br />Ø Public relations, marketing, and event planning  are also conducive to our full-service infrastructure for our clients.<br /><br />Ø  “HighViz is a project company” Public relations, sales, promotion of a new  brand, launch marketing, and event planning are also conducive to our  full-service infrastructure for our clients.<br /><br />Ø We firmly believe that an  event planner creates events to generate interest in whatever the publicist is  promoting.<br /><br />Ø We also have our marketers study the community to determine  how the client is perceived and how its members feel his image could be improved  on an ongoing basis.<br /><br />Ø Advertisers and writers often create the materials  used by publicists, to which HighViz is asked to incorporate in much of our  marketing, promoting and “publicizing”. As we work in this milieu, we also can  determine where and how frequently the company should advertise As Booking  agents are responsible for procuring venues for publicity and anticipating the  effect the events will have on the client’s image, HighViz will also follow  along these lines. . For instance, we believe that our customer may have to  weigh the exposure that comes from being a keynote speaker at an association’s  convention or corporate event to being a guest on a major talk show, holding  their own against the potential friendliness or the hostility of the  host!<br /><br /><br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 130%">So, talk to us….so we can talk  for you!

Basically a public relations firm handles media  relations and is the interface between a company and the news media. Some who  happen to do business development or act as majordomos, facilitating high-level  introductons between corporations and organziations. This falls into the realm  of marketing.A public relations firm or publicist will "pitch" the media on a  story idea involving a company, invention or author. A good pitch about a story  that would interest the people who read, watch or listen to a particular media  outlet gets coverage. I want you to place this in mind about YOUR ORGANZIATION.  Is there something that is topical that you can speak about week after week that  will continue to capture the ATTENTION of the media and the public?- such as  "EAS promotes new health product, to enrich lives of thousands of current and  future customers", as did "Martha Stewart released from Camp Cupcake." You see,  it is all relative here.<br /><br />Many larger companies rely on in-house staff  trained in public relations or marketing while others hire PR consultants or  publicists to handle their PR campaigns. While you may not hire in-house, you  may want to at least farm out an idea weekly and PUBLISH it somewhere, at least  on your website to tie into product launches and promotions.<br /><br />Joe  Nicassio, author of Guerrilla PR Brand Manager, goes into my point even more in  depth.Joe says that whether a company should conduct its public relations,  marketing or advertising campaigns internally or externally should be determined  by these factors (questions):Do you NEED solid, consistent media exposure week  after week, or are you satisfied with "occasional" exposure? Do you have the  internal staff and expertise to commit the internal resources to your public  relations, marketing, advertising efforts?<br /><br />If you have the internal  staff, and they understand Guerrilla PR principles, then there may be no reason  to hire an outside agency. Paradoxically, the busier you get, the easier it is  to parlay, or "set aside" consistent, important PR activities. Don't get caught  in that trap!"Public Relations is a craft that requires Passion," adds Nicassio.  "You may need PR, and you may even have the people to conduct your public  relations, marketing, advertising campaigns but that's not enough. To be truly  effective, your PR campaigns must be conducted with Passionate Consistency."In  my opinion, here is a list of reasons why it makes good business sense to hire a  public relations firm to market your product or service:PR firms can get you TV  and radio coverageA PR firm can get you interviewed on radio and TV.Every day  thousands of interviews are conducted on TV and Radio stations across the North  America and several hundred are with experts and authors. If your own in house  PR person is not trying to get interviewed by the producers of those shows they  won't find you because they simply don't have time to look for you amongst the  many interesting people clamoring for their attention.PR firms have regular  contact with national media outlets<br /><br />PR firms are in regular contact  journalists, editors, writers and producers from top national magazines,  newspapers and radio/TV programs.When was the last time you talked to  representatives from ABC's 20/20... Prime Time. CNN... People... Good Morning  America... Newsweek... Publishers Weekly... Family Circle... Forbes... ABC Radio  Network... Time Magazine... Dateline NBC... The View... Oprah's O magazine...  Fortune Small Business... Cosmopolitan... Fox News... Good Housekeeping or  Newsweek?Probably not lately. And your in-house PR person probably has not  either. The reason? Your in-house person has not established the relationships  with these media outlets. A PR firm with several clients can pitch one, two or  three stories while talking to the same reporter or producer. An in house PR  department does not have this synergy which leaves your firm out of the loop.PR  firms have multiple resources such as an "experts subscription service"  HighVizPR and other top PR firms belong to paid subscription services which  provide dozens of leads everyday from media members looking for an expert to  comment on a particular story. PR firms present you and your firm as an  authority on a particular topic and request an interview. The media will, in  nearly every case, mention your firm in the story as it establishes your  credibility with the reader.<br /><br />Your in-house person is not likely to know  about this service or perhaps the several thousand dollars a year it costs to  get the leads is not cost effective for a firm to buy this service. However a PR  firm can spread this cost over several clients and glean the hundreds of daily  queries looking for the one that may work for you.PR firms can provide media  training.<br /><br />Regardless of your experience most executives need media  training. PR firms use media trainers to prep their clients. When you use a PR  firm they have access to the best ones in the business. Why do you need one?  Just watch the interview talk shows you can tell when an inexperienced executive  is being interviewed. A good trainer will show you how to "plug" your company,  product or service without sounding like an overbearing salesperson. The  training helps you capitalize on every interview and maximize each opportunity  to the fullest.A PR firm can get your press release to the top of the  heap.<br /><br />For your story to compete for attention in the "hard news" slot it  must be compelling and people need to care about it. "On a tour of the Detroit  News a couple of years ago," says Joe Nicassio. "I asked to be taken to the  mailroom. There I saw 20 giant four-foot tall mailbags that come into the  mailroom every day. All I could think of was how many thousands of press  releases were in that pile, and how the odds of any one of them seeing the light  of day were not good. If your press release is in that pile, you want your story  to get to the top of the heap and a PR firm can improve your odds dramatically."  Public relations professionals also have built up contacts in the media, who  trust them for story ideas, and will know where to pitch a certain type of  story.<br /><br />As for ongoing fees most firms operate on a monthly retainer basis  and a minimum time commitment ranging from a few months to a few years. The  level of the fee depends upon the scope of the project. Will it take five  people, one person? Is the firm interested in local, state, regional, national  or international public relations? Is the firm public or private? If it's public  there are more SEC required reports that need filling as well as other  government regulations. All of this will affect the rate quoted.So it's best to  determine what you want and then work with the firm that has a track record of  accomplishments and media placement. Good PR is more than hot air; it requires  continuous implementation of a well thought out strategy to get  results.<br /><br />The following checklist is suggested in part by Guerilla  Marketing Brand Manager's Joe Nicassio to "size up" any public relations firm  you are considering to hire:<br /><br />Do you get along with the members of the  firm? Hiring a PR agency is a collaboration that you can benefit from, month  after month, year after year. Quality rapport is an essential  ingredient.<br /><br />Are they realistic, in terms of managing your expectations,  or do they promise "pie in the sky"? It's one thing for a PR firm to promise  results; it's another thing to promise "specific" results.<br /><br />Maybe you'd  like to get on Oprah Winfrey from the start...so would everyone else. But be  prepared to take advantage of several secondary media opportunities before you  get to the top tier. Several base hits can score you more runs than going for  the grand slam every time.<br /><br />Is the PR firm creative? Creative PR people  will come up with more "angles" to test.<br /><br />Do they understand how to pitch  your story? A progressive PR firm will be effective AND efficient at telling  your story -- yielding you more media coverage.<br /><br />Do they listen to what  you say? Let's face it...your PR needs are constantly evolving. Your PR firm  should listen and respond to your unique, evolving needs.<br /><br />Are they using  a "hard sell" to get you to sign? A good PR firm is a busy PR firm. They don't  need to sell you. Their track record will allow you to decide based on the  evidence.<br /><br />Do they have local, regional, national media contacts? When you  go to a great PR firm, they have cultivated several strategic media  relationships, over many years of time.<br /><br />Do they have the contacts to  place your story in front of the appropriate media?Did they outline a campaign  game plan for you? You can predict the effectiveness of a PR firm by the  soundness of their overall strategic approach.<br /><br />Have you seen samples of  their work? Track record comes in the form of Quality of exposure, in addition  to the Quantity of exposure.<br /><br />Do you feel that they will carry out your PR  campaign with consistent Passion?Do you should feel comfortable with the fee and  the contract? Getting good PR is a process. It requires well thought out plans,  implemented with passion, and a focus on results in the form of getting your  story told to the world.<br /><br />So, whether you conduct your public relations  efforts from within or whether you hire an outside PR firm, if media exposure is  valuable to you and your firm then you must include public relations as an  ongoing systematic part of your marketing mix.<br /><br /># # #<br /><br />HighViz  Consulting Group<br />Abbe Buck, Principal Consultant, Publicist<br />Strategic  Communications and Public Relations<br />(703) 753-4100 - 1-800-380-2825<br /><a href="http://www.highvizpr.com/">http://www.highvizpr.com/</a><br /><a href="http://www.highvizconsulting.com/">http://www.highvizconsulting.com/</a><br /><a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/2007/01/highvizpr@yahoo.com">CHALLENGE US  TODAY!</a><br />Take our HighViz PR - PROMO CHALLENGE!Just 24 hours to concept<a href="http://www.highvizpr.com/">www.highvizpr.com</a><br /><br />PR Portfolio on PR  WEB: <a href="http://www.prweb.com/firm/prf2741.htm">http://www.prweb.com/firm/prf2741.htm</a>*<br />Labels:  <a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/search/label/guerilla" rel="tag">guerilla</a>, <a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/search/label/high%20visibility" rel="tag">high  visibility</a>, <a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Marketing.%20corporations" rel="tag">Marketing. corporations</a>, <a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/search/label/promotions" rel="tag">promotions</a>, <a href="http://highvizpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Public%20Relations" rel="tag">Public Relations</a><br /><br /># # #  <div style="CLEAR: both"></div></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by <span class="fn">Abbe Buck, Publicist / Public  Affairs / Needs Analysis</span> </span><span class="post-timestamp">at <a class="timestamp-link" title="permanent link" href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-to-hire-highvizpr-part-2.html" rel="bookmark"><abbr class="published" title="2007-01-24T03:06:00-05:00">1/24/2007  03:06:00 AM</abbr></a> </span><span class="reaction-buttons"></span><span class="star-ratings"></span><span class="post-comment-link"><a class="comment-link" onclick="javascript:window.open(this.href, &quot;bloggerPopup&quot;, &quot;toolbar=0,location=0,statusbar=1,menubar=0,scrollbars=yes,width=400,height=450&quot;); return false;" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13277784&amp;postID=116962642319785243&amp;isPopup=true">0  comments</a> </span><span class="post-backlinks post-comment-link"><a class="comment-link" href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-to-hire-highvizpr-part-2.html#links">Links  to this post</a> </span></div></div>

Whether we  get our morning news on Yahoo! or not, millions of people watch news,  entertainment and other programming 24/7. Many of these same people among us are  participating in online public discussion groups and starting their own web  logs. This has made the Internet the people's forum - everyone contributes and  every opinion counts.<em> It has lead to more of a poltical “vox populi” (Latin  for “voice of the people”)</em> than we have seen in decades. This is what the  daily newspaper used to do. But now, the news - good or bad, rumor or fact -  travels faster on the Internet than any other medium.<br /><br />Here is a leading  example of this trend, which seems here to stay: As you may have noted in  politics, the internet has quelled Dan Rather’s career as CBS News anchor (with  the Bush National Guard ‘letter’ that was certainly mis-reported. This was not  brought to the forefront by national “network” news, or on cable news networks,  or on talk radio, but by “bloggers” (web-loggers, who have developed their own  private “VOICE OF THE PEOPLE” websites. If you can read e-mail you can receive  their opinion in your in-box, and it can topple an entire news organization when  many band together as a United Front. One of the best examples is on  americablog.com - anything you read is posted there!<br /><br />It could happen to  you!<br /><br />Now think of this: a single unhappy customer, misinformed consumer,  or disgruntled employee can spark an online and offline reputation disaster for  your company. Having a Public Relations firm planning ahead to avert a potential  PR disaster for your company before they become "breaking news" is a market  savvy approach.<br /><br />Putting an organizational PR “Battle Plan” in  place:<br /><br />When damaging news, derogatory rumors, or misinformation “catch  fire” on the Internet. We advise that you have a communications person on your  management team who is well-versed in a range of verticals. It will be this  person’s job #1 to find out where the negative mention started, and to be able  to counter as a spokesperson any negative statement or written word that has  been picked up by media or on the internet. This person must quickly and  effectively find every negative mention of your company online and offline, and  immediately strike back with a (counter) strategy to safeguard your company or  organization.<br /><br />Damage Control – What should we do?<br /><br />When a PR crisis  erupts, it is important to execute a timely response to derogatory or misleading  information about your company. Working closely with top management and  communication staff to disseminate the corporate messages, personnel should  quickly present your side of the story and direct audiences to favorable sources  of information - dampening the flames and exposing the biases of your  detractors.<br /><br />In addition, to an assembled rapid-response team a PR crisis  management website that explained a company’s position to the public and  presents all favorable evidence, argument, and media coverage is a must have.  The address of this website should be distributed to concerned audiences online  through news, search engines, and other channels. Your selected PR firm’s job is  to make sure that the public also had the opportunity to hear your company's  side of the story before negative sentiments can take hold. This can also done  with broadcast reporters and talk-show hosts, who “glom” onto any negotiable  sentiment because it becomes top news. To respond is a must!<br /><br />Media  contacts and online Monitoring<br /><br />While marketers and communicators  specialists are in contact with the top media outlets, broadcast and print, your  PR firm should also has an Online Monitoring team sweeping the Internet  constantly, looking for any and all mentions of your company or organization.  Concerned management must stay informed about the perceptions of their brand and  the opinions of their customers, employees, and professional analysts online and  in print.<br /><br /><br />» Abbe Buck, Publicist,  abbe@highviz.net<br /><br /><br />HighViz Consulting Group<br /><br /><br />T 1-800-380-2825 <br />Description: A PR specialist in the fields of promotion<br /><br /><br /># # #  <div style="CLEAR: both"></div></div> <div class="post-footer"> <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-1"><span class="post-author vcard">Posted by <span class="fn">Abbe Buck, Publicist / Public  Affairs / Needs Analysis</span> </span><span class="post-timestamp">at <a class="timestamp-link" title="permanent link" href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/2007/01/reputation-management-damage-control.html" rel="bookmark"><abbr class="published" title="2007-01-26T07:30:00-05:00">1/26/2007  07:30:00 AM</abbr></a> </span><span class="reaction-buttons"></span><span class="star-ratings"></span><span class="post-comment-link"><a class="comment-link" onclick="javascript:window.open(this.href, &quot;bloggerPopup&quot;, &quot;toolbar=0,location=0,statusbar=1,menubar=0,scrollbars=yes,width=400,height=450&quot;); return false;" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=13277784&amp;postID=7182246637664069734&amp;isPopup=true">0  comments</a> </span><span class="post-backlinks post-comment-link"><a class="comment-link" href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/2007/01/reputation-management-damage-control.html#links">Links  to this post</a> </span><span class="post-icons"><span class="item-action"><a title="Email Post" href="http://www.blogger.com/email-post.g?blogID=13277784&amp;postID=7182246637664069734"><img class="icon-action" height="13" alt="" src="http://www.blogger.com/img/icon18_email.gif" width="18" /> </a></span><span class="item-control blog-admin pid-1101824941"><a title="Edit Post" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=13277784&amp;postID=7182246637664069734"><img class="icon-action" height="18" alt="" src="http://www.blogger.com/img/icon18_edit_allbkg.gif" width="18" />  </a></span></span></div> <div class="post-footer-line post-footer-line-2"><span class="post-labels">Labels:  <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/24%2F7" rel="tag">24/7</a>,  <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Americablog" rel="tag">Americablog</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Damage%20Control" rel="tag">Damage Control</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/entertainment" rel="tag">entertainment</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Google" rel="tag">Google</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/HighViz" rel="tag">HighViz</a>,  <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Law" rel="tag">Law</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/PR" rel="tag">PR</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Presto%20Vivaci" rel="tag">Presto Vivaci</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/Publicity" rel="tag">Publicity</a>, <a href="http://abbebuckpr.blogspot.com/search/label/YOU%20TUBE" rel="tag">YOU  TUBE</a></span></div></div></div>

Prior to jumping into the government contracting arena, the first thing your small business needs to do is register with the Small Business Administration office serving your local customer base:</p><p>• It is critical to register <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">using the righ</span>t North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes based on the products and/or services that you have to offer to the government.</p><p>• You should also apply to become a GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule contractor via the GSA Web site.</p><p>Once these primary steps have been completed, your small business should then register with the following premier federal contracting research organizations:</p><p>• <a onclick="popup(this.href,770,600);return false;" href="http://www.input.com/" target="popup" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 153); "><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">INPUT</span></a> is an authority on government business and "provides market intelligence, analysis, consulting, events, and training to help companies develop government business." The ability to use INPUT effectively can be a critical success factor for a small business.</p><p>• <a onclick="popup(this.href,770,600);return false;" href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov/" target="popup" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 153); ">FedBizOpps.gov</a> can be used to search, monitor, and retrieve "opportunities solicited by the entire federal contracting community." Again, the success of a small business is directly related to using the right keywords while looking for opportunities.</p><p>Success for your small business within the government cannot be achieved without strategic teaming partners:</p><p>• A key strategy in winning contracts is to <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">register as a small business </span>with larger government contractors.</p><p>• Another approach is<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; "> partnering</span> with other government contractors in areas where your small business lacks expertise but can offer complementary products and/or services.</p><p>Finally, physical presence is very important in this business, and<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; "> a successful small business must set up shop in the backyard of the federal government</span>.
