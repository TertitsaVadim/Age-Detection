Every day, the 8Asians team is inundated by many worthy pitches. We are unable to highlight every one that comes our way, or even the ones we might individually support. The projects selected for 8$ are not endorsements by 8Asians. (To be considered for 8$, we highly suggest you not harass the writers or the editors of 8Asians.)

He cautioned that it was a waste of time and more work than it was worth. Though I was skeptical of his assertion, I was a little nervous when, after quitting my corporate Hollywood gig to pursue writing full-time, the story that kept popping into my head was Love Arcadia, a tale [...] <a href="http://www.8asians.com/2013/12/31/one-ticket-to-the-asian-ghetto-please/">Continue&#160;&#187;</a>

Cheng&#8217;s video of her learning to dance in 100 days went viral. Since then, from what I&#8217;ve read in TechCrunch, Cheng has started a new company with a co-founder called Give It 100 - &#8220;Practice something for 100 days. Take a video everyday.&#8221; Perhaps this platform can help you reach one of your new year&#8217;s resolutions. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how well this site / service does. I think [...] <a href="http://www.8asians.com/2014/01/01/karen-dance-in-a-year-cheng-startup-creates-platform-for-anyone-to-learn-a-skill-in-100-days/">Continue&#160;&#187;</a>

From the video description: Does gender bias still exist? If the answer is no, then why is it that women who take charge tend to [...] <a href="http://www.8asians.com/2014/01/02/pantene-philippines-commercial-labels-against-women/">Continue&#160;&#187;</a>

The ads show what a typical mom might be doing with her typical daughter. I do wonder if the mom is a single mom, since we don&#8217;t ever see a dad. (The funniest mom-daughter commercial I think though still this Target ad.)

In early November, Chang announced publicly her candidacy for State Representative for Michigan&#8217;s House District Six, which includes Southwest Detroit, downtown, a significant portion of the East Side of Detroit, and two downriver communities (River Rouge and Ecorse). I had a chance [...] <a href="http://www.8asians.com/2014/01/07/stephanie-chang-running-for-michigan-state-representative-district-6/">Continue&#160;&#187;</a>
