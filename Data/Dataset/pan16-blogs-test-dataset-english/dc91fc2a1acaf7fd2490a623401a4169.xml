Speaking of its taste, Thai tea is second to none. However, it's been a big disappointment after seeing a number of tea products in the Thai market, none of those has differentiated itself from its competition. Thai consumers still opt for well-known and/or imported brands because of its worldwide recognition. Bean&Leaf is created based on the need to refining tea packaging, and to creating brand identity that has equal standard to internationally well-known brands.<br /><br />Below is some samples of Bean&Leaf tea package;<br />Let me know how you think about it. Would you pick them up from a shelf?<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHM0IvnGI/AAAAAAAAALQ/kUYp5yAWI8Y/s1600-h/B%26L2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHM0IvnGI/AAAAAAAAALQ/kUYp5yAWI8Y/s400/B%26L2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111874968777366626" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnHI/AAAAAAAAALY/imXi3Aw3r1M/s1600-h/B%26L.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnHI/AAAAAAAAALY/imXi3Aw3r1M/s400/B%26L.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111874973072333938" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnII/AAAAAAAAALg/lM6wkgsC0Po/s1600-h/B%26L1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnII/AAAAAAAAALg/lM6wkgsC0Po/s400/B%26L1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111874973072333954" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnJI/AAAAAAAAALo/HMDohCmCLJc/s1600-h/B%26L3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNEIvnJI/AAAAAAAAALo/HMDohCmCLJc/s400/B%26L3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111874973072333970" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNUIvnKI/AAAAAAAAALw/fKRnZoLx-XM/s1600-h/B%26L4.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEHNUIvnKI/AAAAAAAAALw/fKRnZoLx-XM/s400/B%26L4.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111874977367301282" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEIKUIvnLI/AAAAAAAAAL4/sGT6bpfh_yg/s1600-h/B%26L5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/RvEIKUIvnLI/AAAAAAAAAL4/sGT6bpfh_yg/s400/B%26L5.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5111876025339321522" /></a><br /><br />Herbal Tea packaged in a clear bottle.

My sister, brother, and I tried to wake him up but he didn't seem to respond to our words. So we called an ambulance. After a preliminary diagnosis, the ER team immediately placed him in ICU. Dad was suffocating. His heart beat was 165 bpm that put him at risk for sudden cardiac arrest. That night, we had to go home because they didn't allow visitors to stay over in the ICU. By the second night, his condition worsened. He couldn't breath by himself so the physician team decided to intubate him. A nurse informed me about side effects of having a tube down his throat and inside his body. But that's the only choice we have. It wasn't pleasant experience to see him on a mechanical ventilation. I cried so hard that night.<br /><br />My dad wasn't healthy to begin with. As far as I remember, he was always overweight. His obesity caused him several diseases including congestive heart failure, hypertension, and gout. Due to accumulation of fat in his trachea, his sleeping posture was merely sitting up. If he lied down, his trachea'd get pushed by the fat which let only small amount of O2 passing through his lungs, and causing him to suffocate.<br /><br />The blood tests came back and confirmed he had lung infection or Pneumonia. It could be malignant in elderly people, specifically people who have congestive heart failure. The doctor tried to comfort our feelings but didn't make any promise on  positive outcome. Most hospitalized patients had weaker immunity to fight diseases and were likely to develop onset diseases later on. On the forth day, a sign of his underlying mental issue emerged. His mouth and nose were covered with the O2 mask and intubation, yet tried to give us a sign language. He insisted he saw dark evils who were trying to kill him in a middle of the night. He seemed nervous about it, then asked us to stay over. After a visiting hour, he began to yell and pull out his intubation and IV that left the nurses no choice but re-intubating him, which consequently caused the bleeding and swelling in his trachea. <br /><br />After a week, his lungs started to clear up and his physical condition recuperated,<br />However, not for his mind. His severe physical illness,later, developed Delirium - a condition of severe confusion and rapid changes in brain function. We decided to have him transferred out of the ICU and to a private room that we were able to stay with him. We took turn to stay up in order to watch him 24/7, and did everything to regain his memory. Our great effort started to pay off by the end of following week. He's starting to come back. <br /><br />Now, dad's back home. He still needs special care so we got him a professional<br />caregiver. Over all, our lives are getting back to normal. Having too much stress<br />put me into getting sick, but I'm getting better as well. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Good</span><br />• Tim and I accepted an offer from ExxonMobil to host its global Team Building Seminar held on September 12. The timing wasn't perfect due to my dad's situation but we tried to work it out. Considering our zombie condition, I was so grateful with the outcome. We got to meet 12 management attendees from the US, which gave us a little excitement.<br />• After doing a marketing research for 6 months, I've gotten familiar with Thai consumer behavior that, in turn, led me to the idea of opening my own business. Currently, I am in the process of forming a brand building company. If things go as I hope, it'd be launched by the end of year.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The Ugly</span><br />It's growing stronger inside me. It's the feelings I've been trying to reject. But now I have to admit it. I miss Chicago. I miss my life, my friends, and my work. I have to repeat myself over and over I've moved on. Thailand is my new home now. But deep down, I still think of it. Maybe this is life. We always yearn for something we don't have, and careless of what we already have.

My employment started a couple of days ago.<br /><br />Q: My own business?<br />A: Still do it. Will do both at the same time until the business's strong enough I can do it full time.<br /><br />Q: Life in general?<br />A: No fun. Getting back to work is not fun as I wished. In fact, it involves too many cups of coffee, stress, headaches, and long hours of dedication. I feel like I'm losing passion over those factors. Being independent for 7 months was boring BUT peaceful. <br /><br />A: Life is full of surprise. I thought things'd get better after Tim and I landed a job. We both now have a decent job. But I haven't yet felt contented. Confusing. <br /><br />A: LOST and not (yet) found<br />My passion. My willpower. And my sparkle eyes.<br /><br /><br />In case I don't have time to update anything next week, just want to give you a heads-up that Matt B. is arriving next Tuesday (Oct.30)  I'll write about him when I have a chance next time.

		<document id="e50d36043005cd8804c07a5311880e96" url="http://apple-angkana.blogspot.com/2007/12/golden-month.html"><![CDATA[December 2, 2007<br /><br />I mentioned in the last entry that I was expecting Matt B's arrival. Matt was a good friend from work back in Chicago. He was one of the two people at DDB that I think<br />would appreciate the culture differences. Matt proved my assumption was right.<br />Initially I was planning to hang out with him throughout the trip. Just a week before his arrival, I got a job offer and had to start on a short notice. So, the whole plan was cancelled and Matt had to wander on his own most of the time. But he never ceased to impress me. In deed, he was doing great on his own.<br /><br />So, Matt, my hat's off to you. And I hope to see you back here again next year.<br /><br />Last Friday was my last day at work. After 5 weeks at work that seemed like forever, I finally called it quit. As much as I like working, or call myself a workaholic, I do have limit. I can tolerate long hours of work on occasions, but not every day until my dedication has become part of job description. It seems normal here that business hours could be extended into to midnight or 3-4 am in the morning. Employees don't complain because other companies are doing the same thing. I can't help but wonder why people work this hard but the country doesn't go anywhere. Why is Thailand still a developing country? (note: it's my sarcastic joke, you don't need to find the explanation.)<br /><br />Anyway, my life theory is hard work brings success, overwork brings death.<br /><br />By the time I got burned out from work, the other job offer came along. It's from an Australian design consultancy company based in Bangkok, offered me a Design Manager position. My new job responsibilities include managing people and overseeing all the work. I won't design anymore, which is perfect because I will have time to do my own work for my own company.<br /><br />The best of all is I feel like I'm back in the States again. DDB has a great work culture that's become my standard of what the company culture should be. The Australian company offered me the perk and benefit similared to that and beyond. They allow employees to be off on both Thai and Western holidays. It's the kind of company I want to work for. It's the company that cares about its own people that, in turn, will be awarded by great work from people with appreciation. I for one, believe, great work comes from happy people.<br /><br />The end of the year is right around the corner. December is a month of long holiday break and celebration. Bangkok at this time of year is looking great with holiday light decorations and out-door beer festivals across the city. The weather is decent. It's cold enough that I'm thinking about wearing kneel-high boots to work. (not common here) I love Bangkok in December. Tim and I agree if the weather is like this<br />all year round, we will never want to move elsewhere. Tim is also doing so great on his new role at Citibank, which reassure us on our moving home decision. And myself - things are coming together after rough months of adjustment. I'm feeling obtimistic about my future. I'm hoping I will fit in at a new place so I can end my job hunting. On the next entry, I will update you about my new job and my journey down on a remote Island, South of Thailand.

A few photos were taken from my friend's house built on top of the hill. It was a nice get-away trip. I'm glad I decided to go. <br /><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrEL6SYI/AAAAAAAAAMg/qZY-F5RFhO8/s1600-h/1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrEL6SYI/AAAAAAAAAMg/qZY-F5RFhO8/s400/1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154938960895166850" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SZI/AAAAAAAAAMo/dlQ7867oWiI/s1600-h/2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SZI/AAAAAAAAAMo/dlQ7867oWiI/s400/2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154938965190134162" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/FL7TyGQvHm8/s1600-h/3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SaI/AAAAAAAAAMw/FL7TyGQvHm8/s400/3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154938965190134178" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SbI/AAAAAAAAAM4/vzZPuf444oI/s1600-h/4.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/R4oFrUL6SbI/AAAAAAAAAM4/vzZPuf444oI/s400/4.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5154938965190134194" /></a><br /><br />There are so many social activities to attend to this month. Our friends from a far-away land keep coming here for<br />a visit. The last one will leave the country in Feb. Well, now I don't know what I'm going to do after they all left.<br />Last night we're up until 4 am to hang out with Tony. He's leaving tonight for Chicago and no doubt we'll miss him lot.

That means I will have all day writing my blog, emailing to friends, and having a long phone conversation with Tim, which normally we could spare only 5-10 minutes max. per phone call/per day.  <br />'Work has been crazy' <br />I was under impression, when accepting an offer for a Design Manager position, that moving up to a management level would help me get out of work early. After all, my assumption is proved to be wrong. LOL.<br /><br />I've been asked about my current job and a company I work with. To save my precious time corresponding, I'm going to post it in details here;<br /><br />I've worked for an Australian Design Consultancy based in BKK. it's not a Design Firm, nor Advertising Agency. It's a company that provides a full range of design services to Aviation, Hotel, and Airport business. The company offers services ranging from Cabin Crews training(training courses and crews recruiting), Aircraft (Interior - seat, fabric, and floor design), Catering (food&Beverage, packagings, and menus) , Airport Lounges for world famous clients such as Cathay Pacific, ANA, British Midlands, Savoy Moscow, Shangri-La hotels and Resorts.  All of the above won't happen without a great deal of visual communication. It's where Design department does magic on astonishing print work and presentations.<br /><br />The great benefit of working for the company is an opportunity to explore a new business territory - to learn what's out there besides Advertising business. My daily job involves managing Design team, liaising with Project Managers locating oversea, and maintaining the look and feel of the company through print collateral.<br /><br />So far I've enjoyed my new role. However, managing and dealing with people are a great pain. Sometimes I miss the time I could hide alone in my cube and designed creative work. My respected Creative Director said to me once I was fortunate to do the job I love and did not have to deal with others. I'm beginning to understand what she meant by that now.<br /><br />Therefore my new-year's resolutions for 2008 are;<br />1. getting out of the rat race as soon as I can.<br />2. getting out of the rat race as soon as I can. <br /><br />and...getting out of the rat race as soon as I can. <br /><br /><br />Happy Holiday :)

I went to the fair on the "Trade" Day, and then went back again on the "Public" Day. I dragged my (heavy) camera along, just to find out it ran out of the battery. (GOSH!) So, I had to take a day off from work and went back to shoot some photos. It's the first time my blog showcases some cool local design. As you can see how WOww they really are, especially houseware - took my breath away just to look at a one-of-the-kind collection - and unbelievably inexpensive. I wish I had my own place now so I'd fill the space in with those furniture. Unfortunately they did not allow us to take a photo of the masterpieces. I've recorded everything into my brain though. The fair is held twice a year - Summer and Fall. Surely I would find my way back there in October!!<br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99TCjtFI/AAAAAAAAANQ/ZNfKh6yzaZk/s1600-h/1.1.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99TCjtFI/AAAAAAAAANQ/ZNfKh6yzaZk/s400/1.1.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193140706115564626" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99jCjtGI/AAAAAAAAANY/ZepDrSgi3rU/s1600-h/2.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99jCjtGI/AAAAAAAAANY/ZepDrSgi3rU/s400/2.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193140710410531938" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99zCjtHI/AAAAAAAAANg/Enjnj1prsNQ/s1600-h/3.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99zCjtHI/AAAAAAAAANg/Enjnj1prsNQ/s400/3.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193140714705499250" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99zCjtII/AAAAAAAAANo/9H8wbDuEOOQ/s1600-h/4.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG99zCjtII/AAAAAAAAANo/9H8wbDuEOOQ/s400/4.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193140714705499266" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG9-DCjtJI/AAAAAAAAANw/AVHobFqSJGU/s1600-h/5.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBG9-DCjtJI/AAAAAAAAANw/AVHobFqSJGU/s400/5.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193140719000466578" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCaTCjtKI/AAAAAAAAAN4/0iLM_rKcHTU/s1600-h/6.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCaTCjtKI/AAAAAAAAAN4/0iLM_rKcHTU/s400/6.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193145602378282146" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbDCjtLI/AAAAAAAAAOA/fpPm0pS_VrU/s1600-h/7.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbDCjtLI/AAAAAAAAAOA/fpPm0pS_VrU/s400/7.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193145615263184050" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbTCjtMI/AAAAAAAAAOI/kIKSydL_-tc/s1600-h/8.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbTCjtMI/AAAAAAAAAOI/kIKSydL_-tc/s400/8.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193145619558151362" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbjCjtNI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/Buw5aKnUzGA/s1600-h/9.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbjCjtNI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/Buw5aKnUzGA/s400/9.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193145623853118674" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbzCjtOI/AAAAAAAAAOY/cHylWmmqby0/s1600-h/10.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SBHCbzCjtOI/AAAAAAAAAOY/cHylWmmqby0/s400/10.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5193145628148085986" /></a>

Happy birthday to myself.<br /><br />To make up for last month entry, I will write a couple this month. I wanted to write something for March though. The month is so important as March 15 was my one-year anniversary of being back home. From that day forward, my wanderlust has been risen up. Every morning, while I was doing my spiritual routine - sipping coffee and looking out the office's window, I was picturing the pretty lake Michigan on the horizon. Thinking what It would be like had I not decided to move back. Would my life be different? better or worse? If anyone has seen the movie "sliding door", you know what I mean.<br /><br />A couple of days ago, my good friend from DDB delivered her bad news via email that was quite shocking. Another round of lay-off within the same year - and she was on that list.  My team has got let go and it was quite sad they were part of my good memory at DDB. Would it have been me on that list had I still worked there?<br /><br />Strange things happen in life.<br /><br />To my boss, if you happen to come across my blog, you would have told me I made the right decision, won't you?<br /><br /><br />Next weekend I'm going to Bangkok International Gift Fair (BIG+BIH) to get inspiration for my own business. It's the coolest gift trade show in Thailand. I will write about it on my next entry plus some photos of cool stuff!<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE: Song-kran festival will start in a couple of days. And YES! we're getting 5 days off from work ..Woo Hoo...<br />If you you want to know more, check out my April 2007 entry.

Every mall I went lured me away with oversized FLASHY RED bargain signs and inviting numbers like '70% off'  ...Omigod... some malls even had its sale going on until midnight. So that's that. Thanks to its marketing/advertising departments, I wasted my whole month on the shopping spree. Very productive(!)<br /><br /><br />Last but not least, my Chicagoan friends, I'll be in Chicago from mid SEP - early OCT for a vacation. Hope we can meet up and<br />paint the town red. See ya soon!

The tooth did not bother me but according to my full-mouth X-ray, it's impacted so my dentist suggested the tooth to be extracted.<br /><br />It was a complicated procedure - about 2 hours long. At some point during pulling and drilling and pulling (again) process, I was beginning to question my decision -- well, the tooth was doing fine underneath my gums for over decades ---and causing no troubles --- but why do I trouble it? Should I not trouble the trouble, until trouble troubles me? <br /><br />Anyway.. after the surgery, I felt a bit silly with my decision --my jaw bone got swollen and I expected my facial inflammation in the next 24 hours.<br /><br />It's December and this month has always been my favorite. It's the month people are giving and sharing happiness to one another. But it's also the time I sit down and look at my wish list - things to do before I die. The list is not long at all,<br />in fact, it has only one wish--- but I can't accomplish it yet.<br /><br />Hope you're working on your wish list too. Don't loose hope and stay out of troubles. Some day we'll get to sit down and share our dreams altogether.<br /><br /><br />No matter where you live, I'm wishing you a very happy life in the year 2009. <br /><br />Nothing beats  'good family, good lover, and good friends' <br /><br />Happy New Year<br />apple

The tragedy in family had endure as if it would have gone on endlessly. I was depressed.<br /><br />Then one night, after a tiring day at work, while sorting out a pile of junk mail, I picked up a tiny book not bigger than my palm but full of such incredibly encouraging words of wisdom.  Reading the book from front to back, my mind absorbed and digested every word so much it put off my distress.  The experience shocked me as I'd also been a reader but why this time's so different than every other time? It could be the stuff I read was not my usual preferences (Economy, Politics, and News)<br />Reading the books I was blocked out of the dull and painful world - the feelings were so great I yearned for more. I wanted it linger and permanent so I continued on reading.  I've been up late and into early morning every night keeping up on my marathon reading. I have sleep deprivation and look like shit but my soul fulfilled.  <br />It's my uncontrollable addiction.<br /><br />I want to be myself again. I had lost it in the past few months and lived in fear - being terrified of things that never happen. I want to be myself who never look back in the past, live the moment, and look optimistically to the future.<br /><br />Until that time-----

But thinking you may want to know what's happening in my life so here it is... I'm back on a job-hunting market again. There came a sudden and shocking announcement on the 10th of  this month - the closure of Bangkok head quarter office; resulting from the worldwide impact of the recession, our business is in the luxury, high-end services which is nice-to-haves but not the must-haves. Most of us took the news in a calm and professional manner. On a positive note, out of generosity of CEO, we've got a decent surveillance package that'd keep us sane for a long while.<br /><br />My last day of employment is March 31. After that, I have to start looking into my career path.. my goal.. and possibilities.. I always keep my options open and this time I need to get it into the right direction. Time is so precious I can't afford to loose a single minute wandering in a wrong direction. Nervous but also excited about my future as things always happen for a reason. <br /><br />Since last week I started freelancing for an ad agency. The freelancing option works best at this time as I need some time to figure something out. In retrospect, I had turned down a few freelance projects - thinking I prefer to use up my energy on my business to someone else's. Surprisingly, freelancing was not a bad idea at all. I had so much fun on that project. The deadline was tight I had to be up all night to finish it. I got my adrenaline pumping and going, like I was high the entire time. I love that feeling! Now I know my passion for design will never go away from me...<br /><br />and as always... unti then...

Since then, I've been fond of the '9'. It has always been my lucky number. I had made a big birthday plan for this special day but it went down the drain because of Politics crap (again).<br />The anti-government rally is going overboard. At this exact moment they're making a demonstration but not in the allowed area. They're stomping down several streets, which happen to be in the heart of the city causing traffic chaos and streets shutdown. I was on my way to meet up with Tim and Toon for dinner & drinks but had to run back home for safety's sake. Nobody knows how nasty it's going to turn out. Anyway, I've completed my mission today - things I wanted to do on my birthday. At least I'm not wasting my entire day on that silly demonstration. <br />Thanks to you who remembers my birthday. Thanks for the text messaging, emails, phone calls,  e-birthday card, and live birthday song over the phone - they all have made my day. some little thing that made me smile - better than expensive presents. Happy birthday to me.. in the next 5 years, it won't matter and I would stop counting... Alas.<br /><br />(APR 14 2009)  Political Update: It's ended.. bravo! I think they must have been satisfied with their accomplishment - to show the world how uncivilized the country is. Bad apples. sigh...

Love his words so much I want to share it with you. Richard, hope you don't mind the open letter.<br /><br />Quoted (Richard)<br /><blockquote>....Good to hear from you, congrats on starting your new business. I went through your web site and enjoyed it and found it interesting. I like the words “Brand Applique” especially the french word “Applique”.<br />Things around are pretty much the way they were when your were down this time last year. The economy  has to pick up soon,<br />Its a gutsy thing to start a business during these times.  However many businesses were started up during difficult times.  A fellow named Leo, during the depression started an ad agency, and his friends said the within time he would be selling apples on the street. That person was “Leo Burnett” and to this day apples are given out on each LB floor of 35 East Wacker.<br />  <br />So best of luck and much success.</blockquote><br /><br />Apple's correspondence:<br />Hi Richard, <br />A million thanks to your encouraging email. I know it's extremely difficult to start up a business during this time. Obviously I had 2 options - either sit back and do nothing, hoping for the global economy to recover soon OR doing something. And I think you know my character and the option I was going with.  There's a great possibility my business may fail, and I may go bankrupt. But put a positive spin to this, whatever the outcome is, I've immensely learned about running the business.  The business itself requires all my time to stay alert in the global trend and networking. It's a hands-on experience - better than taking MBA classes and learn from text books. It's a great investment in term of learning and experiencing the real world, yet gaining revenue would be a plus to that. Of course, I'm nervous too, but where there's a will, there's a way. Several successful business started up during difficult times. I just need to experiment it until I find my niche market and vice versa. I'm also lunching products in a local market - they'll be all fashion related. Thai girls are trendy and willing to spend extra bucks to make themselves look fab. I've created products based on domestic and international trend - both are different niche market. I'm more worried about international market though. As the big drawbacks are to become a trusted seller and an issue with the cost of international shipping. Nobody wants to buy a product from a store that has no review and located in a foreign country...huh... That's my homework -  to break the barrier.<br />We all learn from our mistakes. I'm learning too. Nothing comes too easy unless we're willing to take a risk and learn from our mistakes. We're given only one life. Live it.

Feel guilty I should have written to you more often but I've been super busy. Here's a recap of what I did back in July.<br /><br />I've been into WEB learning stuff, especially SEO (Search Engine Optimizations), Open sources - wordpress, and E-commerce business. I've heard about those fancy tech terms for a long while but never paid attention to it until a few months ago. I have to admit I'm officially a wordpress mania. LOL.  Learning the technical stuff helps me build a better understanding of E-commerce business. Though I've come up with several new business ideas through the learning process. I've made a list of things-to-do which is long enough to cover my AUG-SEP schedule already.<br /><br /> <br /><a href="http://appleangkana.com"><span style="font-weight:bold;">appleangkana.com</span></a> is my BABY. The web site has been updated frequently. It now offers several sections: product reviews, design resources, and even freebies! I'll start communicating through appleangkana.com from this point onward. I'll keep updating my life on this blog as usual and will be writing on <a href="http://appleangkana.com">a.angkana</a> on a regular basis. So, if you miss me, you know where to find me :) Oh..I need your inputs too. I need to know if <a href="http://appleangkana.com">a.angkana</a> web site is user friendly. How do you feel about navigation bars? Do you find what you look for easily? Give me your 2 cents (or more!) Write to me at apple@appleangkana.com<br /><br />Brand Applique is not doing so great. Other ETSY sellers complain about the slow market too. Some said things will pick up when Summer's over. Contrary to domestic market, a.angkana product sales look promising. So in case you want to know what I'm selling in the local market. Let's meet it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SnlRN57UJ4I/AAAAAAAAAiM/Vz195JZHEGo/s1600-h/brownBAG-For-WEB.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 169px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E9t7PrzmnJY/SnlRN57UJ4I/AAAAAAAAAiM/Vz195JZHEGo/s400/brownBAG-For-WEB.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366409730318411650" /></a><br /><br />Guys.. you can leave now. But girls this is your lifesaver.<br />It's the handbag dust cover. Design is very simple but the dust bag is made of water-proof/UV protection fabric. It comes in various sizes. That the largest size can fit LV Speedy family. The coolest thing about the bag is it'll protect your expensive handbags from humidity and light, which original dust bag that comes with handbag can't do the job. How great is that! Anyway, that's why it's doing so well. I'm selling them in a specific community site where people who love name brands trade and purchase expensive merchandise.<br /><br />My goal this month is to launch a second product in the local market as well as launching the rest of pattern arts/Fall collection at <a href="http://monsana.etsy.com">Brand Applique </a>shop. Soon Brand Applique will offer various pattern arts for DIY projects. They'll be all digital arts people can download and have fun with their creative projects. I'm planing to launch pattern arts for various occasions as well. The direction I'm going to will completely eliminate the issue of international shipping and delivery time. I'm excited just to think about it already. Don't ask me why I'm so hyperactive.. it's my passion, friends..<br /><br />Don't forget to check a.angkana website on August 12 for a surprise freebie. It's going to be awesome for people who love handmade stuff. (for dudes..I'm not going to give away gadgets or laptops.. ok? just girly stuff.. you may not be interested.. but you're more than welcome to visit a.angkana)<br /><br />be back next month! <br />apple

The thlos products are made of 100% organic herbs. No chemical added.<br /><br />Created by a.angkana<br />Expected Launching Date: Feb 1 2010 at http://thlos.com<br /><br /><br />Note from author:<br />December was always my favorite month of each year but last year it ended badly.<br />There're lot going on since Aug 2009, mostly due to family stuff. However, I'm hanging in there. Thlos project was created last year and initially was scheduled to have a big launch in December. Since the deadline's passed, I'm not certain I'd still want to push it forward ....we will see....
