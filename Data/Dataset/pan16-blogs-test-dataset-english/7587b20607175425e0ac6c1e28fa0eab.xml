I recently attended a funeral of a woman who had raised 6 children, 19 grandchildren and was a selfless serving and giving woman. She was loved by all and dedicated her life to serving her children, grandchildren, spouse and others. I was so touched to hear in her eulogy by her son that she had left a journal for them to remember her by not to mention her coveted crescent rolls from scratch recipe. I decided after hearing that talk that I want my children and my spouse to always know how much I LOVE THEM. So I decided to continue with this blog that I started a year ago and to keep a journal of our family life. We'll see how it goes. Raising three children brings so much joy and happiness but it also takes work and is a humbling lesson in selflessness. I truly believe that children are sent to us to teach us how to love unconditionally and teach us how to think of others more than ourselves. I am thankful for the life lessons they teach me and am so blessed to have been given the opportunity to love and serve them everyday. I often joke with my husband that I am a "professional but wiper" and that somedays being in the trenches with the children although somewhat challenging at times can be so rewarding when they climb up on your lap and kiss you gently  and tell you in the sweetest voice, "I LOVE YOU, Mommy" and all of the work is worthwhile. There is nothing in life I would rather be doing then being a Mom who chose to stay and work inside my home.  It has been so rewarding to be able to see my children grow. Always remember that , You can always make more money but you can NEVER get the TIME back. Children spell love T-I-M-E. I am having the time of my life watching them grow and teaching them to truly love eachother one day, one moment, one recipe, one kiss at a time. I Love to hear the sounds of my children belly laughing while playing and rolling on the floor with my husband. These are some of the sweetest sounds you will ever hear. Things I want my children to do everyday..that Mommy does too, is  read their scriptures even if it just one verse, pray daily, and be grateful for everything you have in your life. Love Your Life!<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/CTjiO/~4/0FoXGE_V_hE" height="1" width="1"/>

I recently found photos of Madeline's baby blessing!  So glad to find them on my computer!  I am posting these beautiful pictures from her Baby Blessing. Madeline Noel McGrady was given a name and a blessing earlier this year. This picture is taken in front of the Raleigh Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Apex.  We were sealed as a family for all Time and Eternity in the Holy  Temple on December 16, 2005, my 30th birthday. Madeline was born under the covenant and therefore is automatically sealed to us. Pictured here are my parents with us who attended Madeline's beautiful baby blessing given to her by her father. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ivUcfYTV4M/TpUGbluOVWI/AAAAAAAAAC4/QZlQBus7LGE/s1600/blessinhg.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="320" width="180" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5ivUcfYTV4M/TpUGbluOVWI/AAAAAAAAAC4/QZlQBus7LGE/s320/blessinhg.JPG" /></a></div>  Here are some more photos of her special day!

Uchdorf, Here are some of my favorite bits..   First, forget not to be patient with yourself. I want to tell you something that I hope you will take in the right way: God is fully aware that you and I are not perfect.  Let me add: God is also fully aware that the people you think are perfect are not.  And yet we spend so much time and energy comparing ourselves to others—usually comparing our weaknesses to their strengths. This drives us to create expectations for ourselves that are impossible to meet. As a result, we never celebrate our good efforts because they seem to be less than what someone else does.  Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.  It’s wonderful that you have strengths.  And it is part of your mortal experience that you do have weaknesses.  God wants to help us to eventually turn all of our weaknesses into strengths,1 but He knows that this is a long-term goal. He wants us to become perfect,2 and if we stay on the path of discipleship, one day we will. It’s OK that you’re not quite there yet. Keep working on it, but stop punishing yourself.  Dear sisters, many of you are endlessly compassionate and patient with the weaknesses of others. Please remember also to be compassionate and patient with yourself.  In the meantime, be thankful for all the small successes in your home, your family relationships, your education and livelihood, your Church participation and personal improvement. Like the forget-me-nots, these successes may seem tiny to you and they may go unnoticed by others, but God notices them and they are not small to Him. If you consider success to be only the most perfect rose or dazzling orchid, you may miss some of life’s sweetest experiences.  For example, insisting that you have a picture-perfect family home evening each week—even though doing so makes you and everyone around you miserable—may not be the best choice. Instead, ask yourself, “What could we do as a family that would be enjoyable and spiritual and bring us closer together?” That family home evening—though it may be modest in scope and execution—may have far more positive long-term results.  Our journey toward perfection is long, but we can find wonder and delight in even the tiniest steps in that journey.  Second, forget not the difference between a good sacrifice and a foolish sacrifice. An acceptable sacrifice is when we give up something good for something of far greater worth.  Giving up a little sleep to help a child who is having a nightmare is a good sacrifice. We all know this. Staying up all night, jeopardizing our own health, to make the perfect accessory for a daughter’s Sunday outfit may not be such a good sacrifice.  Dedicating some of our time to studying the scriptures or preparing to teach a lesson is a good sacrifice. Spending many hours stitching the title of the lesson into homemade pot holders for each member of your class perhaps may not be.  Every person and situation is different, and a good sacrifice in one instance might be a foolish sacrifice in another.  How can we tell the difference for our own situation? We can ask ourselves, “Am I committing my time and energies to the things that matter most?” There are so many good things to do, but we can’t do all of them. Our Heavenly Father is most pleased when we sacrifice something good for something far greater with an eternal perspective. Sometimes, that may even mean nurturing small but beautiful forget-me-not flowers instead of a large garden of exotic blooms.   Third, forget not to be happy now. In the beloved children’s story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the mysterious candy maker Willy Wonka hides a golden ticket in five of his candy bars and announces that whoever finds one of the tickets wins a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate.  Written on each golden ticket is this message: “Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket … ! Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you! … Mystic and marvelous surprises … will … delight, … astonish, and perplex you.”3  In this classic children’s story, people all over the world desperately yearn to find a golden ticket. Some feel that their entire future happiness depends on whether or not a golden ticket falls into their hands. In their anxiousness, people begin to forget the simple joy they used to find in a candy bar. The candy bar itself becomes an utter disappointment if it does not contain a golden ticket.  So many people today are waiting for their own golden ticket—the ticket that they believe holds the key to the happiness they have always dreamed about. For some, the golden ticket may be a perfect marriage; for others, a magazine-cover home or perhaps freedom from stress or worry.  There is nothing wrong with righteous yearnings—we hope and seek after things that are “virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy.”4 The problem comes when we put our happiness on hold as we wait for some future event—our golden ticket—to appear<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/CTjiO/~4/4XRjFlBEm8M" height="1" width="1"/>

 The PFA- Parent Faculty Association at Sterling Montessori Academy and Charter School that Liam attends made a Great Decision this year to start school 5 days early to account for Hurricane Days and Snow Days! I think it is great that with 5 days built in to the calendar year  already so no need to make up anydays this year!  Hopefully!
 
 
 
    Well we survived our <b>First<i></i></b> Hurricane of the Season, Hurricane Irene. No real problems here in Fuquay, just needed heavy rain and wind.  It was also a great reminder to me the importance of always being prepared for emergencies. I think the Lord often blesses us with the gift of warnings to coax us to be prepared for the "big one" someday.
 
 
 
 
 
  We also experienced our <i>First<b></b></i> Earthquake here out of Mineral Springs, Virginia. We survived a hurricane and an earthquake in the same week!  We have never had an earthquake in my lifetime so that was kind of scary and strange. Liam came home from school and told me he wasn't scared and that he learned how to do his <i>First <b></b></i>Earthquake drill and to crawl under his desk and cover his head. He showed me how too,  in case I needed to learn under the coffee table in the living room!  We are all set, in the event of tornadoes run to the bathtub and in the event of an earthquake get under a table...Liam is such a bright and happy child...I love him more  and more each day...as I do each one of my children...I Love them All the Same:)

 Shawn was off that day and we actually didn't feel anything because we were on our <i>First<b></b></i> visit to Shawn's mother, Teresa Carpenter McGrady's father and Grandfather, Theodore Carpenter's Farm and Great Grandather John Wesley Carpenter located in Butner, North Carolina. There are 63.5 acres nestled on the Granville County/Durham County line. The 2 homes are still standing. One home belonging to Shawn's Grandfather and Great Grandfather Carpenter. This was the <i>First time <b></b></i>in 8 years of marriage that Shawn has taken me here. Shawn felt prompted to go and show me the places he used to visit as a child with his family. He has wonderful memories of working on his Grandaddy's farm and fishing in the beautiful pond. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

  Shawn and I are really into researching our genealogy so it was awesome to go and see where his family used to live. There was a beautiful spirit there and we left with a sense of happiness and peace after visiting. Shamus loved to see the beautiful lake and Madeline looked around in her stroller. I hope and know that their Grandparents and Great Grandparents were smiling down from Heaven with pride as their grandchildren looked in awe from their stroller at the beautiful farmland.   Liam was in school but  Shawn has promised to take Liam there soon, so he can see where his Daddy built his<i> First tree fort and caught his<i> First <b></b></i>fish and learned how to harvest a farm.

   Madeline said her <i>First word <b></b></i>this month and it was "MaMa"!  I was so happy that one of my children actually said my name first!! She is "Mommy's baby doll" as Shamus affectionately calls her.

  Shamus started speaking in his<b> First <i></i></b>full phrase sentences, this month.  I asked Shamus the other day.."What  do  you drink Milk out of ?"  and I was hoping he would answer " out of a cup, Mommy", but instead he said , "Milk comes from Mommy's boobies". I laughed and asked him, " No, where do You get milk from Shamus?"  and Shamus replied, " Ohh, I drink milk from cow, Mommy".   Well, you can't beat kid logic but I sure am impressed with how well he communicates, speaks, and understands at such a young age. He really makes me smile.  
 
 
 
 
 Liam got his<b> First </b>note from both his School teacher and his Sunday School teacher about how well he has been listening in school and doing well on his math problems and being reverent and an example in his Sunday school class. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I watched Extreme Couponing for the <b>First </b>Time and learned how to coupon from my friend Laura and my sister Kate  this month. Kate taught me how to CVS, Harris Teeter and Walmart coupon, saving me a wopping $79.62 on my <i>first <b></b></i>time!!! I can't wait to build up my family food and household storage and then start to donate to deployed soldiers, the food bank and battered women's shelters. So send me your extra coupons if you don't use them!  I am following both the Southern Savers and Krazy Koupon lady blogs.  Absolutely amazing and boy did I learn alot.  Never ever pay full price!!

 I read my <b>First </b>book in a long, long time...thanks to my Mom, "The Help", what an inspiring Book...I can not wait to see he movie...!!  I also quit facebook and for the <b>First </b>time have so much more time to dedicate to my 3 children and husband that I don't even know what life was like before..I can barely keep this blog updated now.. 
 
 Shawn began his <b>First</b> semester of his Senior year at Campbell University this past month. He has 200 credits, technically only needed 177 to gaduate but due to changing majors a few times like many of us have done including myself  will now graduate with a Major in Homeland Security, and two minors one in Criminal Justice and oneminor in ITS, Information technology Securities. I am soo very proud of him and  how much he has accomplished working fulltime switching every two weeks from days to nights, attending college full-time, and still managing to serve in his church calling as a Ward Missionary and still Home Teaches two families a month. 
 He truly amazes me how He provides for our family and still manages to serve others.

  Well that is all the <b>First's</b> I can thing of for now... I am going to leave you with a message from  <i>The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints<b></b></i>, I love this proclamation so much that I have it hanging in a frame in my home..it is called The Family... A Proclamation to The World: 
 
 In “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” an official declaration released in 1995, Church leaders proclaimed that “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.” God's plan enables families who live the gospel and receive the necessary ordinances to be together forever with Him. 
 
 Additional Information
 On September 23, 1995, President Gordon B. Hinckley, the 15th President of the Church, read the following proclamation in a general Relief Society meeting. This inspired proclamation, titled “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” has become the Church's definitive statement on the family: 
 
 “We, the First Presidency and the Council of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children. 
 
 ”All human beings—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. 
 
 “In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or her divine destiny as an heir of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally. 
 
 ”The first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for His children to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare that God has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. 
 
 “We declare the means by which mortal life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan. 
 
 ”Husband and wife have a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children. 'Children are an heritage of the Lord' (Psalms 127:3). Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives—mothers and fathers—will be held accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations. 
 
 “The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed. 
 
 ”We warn that individuals who violate covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God. Further, we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets. 
 
 “We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102).

The Church, in large part, exists for the salvation and exaltation of the family.<br /><br />At a recent general priesthood meeting, I spoke directly to the young men of the Aaronic Priesthood regarding their duties and responsibilities.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, at a general women's conference, I spoke to the young women of the Church, discussing their opportunities and their sacred callings.<br /><br />Tonight, at this fireside for parents, seeking the sweet inspiration of heaven, I would like to speak directly to the mothers assembled here and throughout the Church, for you are, or should be, the very heart and soul of the family.<br /><br />No more sacred word exists in secular or holy writ than that of mother. There is no more noble work than that of a good and God-fearing mother.<br /><br />This evening I pay tribute to the mothers in Zion and pray with all my heart that what I have to say to you will be understood by the Spirit and will lift and bless your lives in your sacred callings as mothers.<br /><br />President David O. McKay declared: "Motherhood is the greatest potential influence either for good or ill in human life. The mother's image is the first that stamps itself on the unwritten page of the young child's mind. It is her caress that first awakens a sense of security, her kiss, the first realization of affection; her sympathy and tenderness, the first assurance that there is love in the world." (Gospel Ideals, p. 452.)<br /><br />President McKay continues: "Motherhood consists of three principal attributes or qualities: namely, (1) the power to bear, (2) the ability to rear, (3) the gift to love. . . This ability and willingness properly to rear children, the gift to love, and eagerness, yes, longing to express it in soul development, make motherhood the noblest office or calling in the world. She who can paint a masterpiece or write a book that will influence millions deserves the admiration and the plaudits of mankind; but she who rears successfully a family of healthy, beautiful sons and daughters, whose influence will be felt through generations to come, . . . deserves the highest honor that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God." (Gospel Ideals, pp. 453-54.)<br /><br />With all my heart I endorse the words of President McKay.<br /><br />In the eternal family, God established that fathers are to preside in the home. Fathers are to provide, to love, to teach, and to direct.<br /><br />But a mother's role is also God-ordained. Mothers are to conceive, to nourish, to love, and to train. So declare the revelations.<br /><br />In Section 132 of Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord states that the opportunity and responsibility of wives is "to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfill the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified" (D&C 132:62). With this divine injunction, husbands and wives, as co-creators, should eagerly and prayerfully invite children into their homes.<br /><br />Then, as each child joins their family circle, they can gratefully exclaim, as did Hannah, "For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore also I have lent him to the Lord: as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord" (1 Samuel 1:27-28).<br /><br />Isn't that beautiful? A mother praying to bear a child and then giving him to the Lord.<br /><br />I have always loved the words of Solomon: "Children are an heritage of the Lord and . . . happy is the man [and woman] that hath [their] quiver full of them" (see Psalm 127: 3-5 ).<br /><br />I know the special blessings of a large and happy family, for my dear parents had a quiver full of children. Being the oldest of eleven children, I saw the principles of unselfishness, mutual consideration, loyalty to each other, and a host of other virtues developed in a large and wonderful family with my noble mother as the queen of that home.<br /><br />Young mothers and fathers, with all my heart I counsel you not to postpone having your children, being co-creators with our Father in heaven.<br /><br />Do not use the reasoning of the world, such as, "We'll wait until we can better afford having children, until we are more secure, until John has completed his education, until he has a better paying job, until we have a larger home, until we've obtained a few of the material conveniences," and on and on.<br /><br />This is the reasoning of the world and is not pleasing in the sight of God. Mothers who enjoy good health, have your children and have them early. And, husbands, always be considerate of your wives in the bearing children.<br /><br />Do not curtail the number of your children for personal or selfish reasons. Material possessions, social convenience, and so-called professional advantages are nothing compared to a righteous posterity. In the eternal perspective, children--not possessions, not position, not prestige--are our greatest jewels.<br /><br />Brigham Young emphasized: "There are multitudes of pure and holy spirits waiting to take tabernacles, now what is our duty?--To prepare tabernacles for them; to take a course that will not tend to drive those spirits into the families of the wicked, where they will be trained in wickedness, debauchery, and every species of crime. It is the duty of every righteous man and woman to prepare tabernacles for all the spirits they can" (Discourses of Brigham Young, p. 197).<br /><br />Yes, blessed is the husband and wife who have a family of children. The deepest joys and blessings in life are associated with family, parenthood, and sacrifice. To have those sweet spirits come into the home is worth practically any sacrifice.<br /><br />We realize that some women, through no fault of their own, are not able to bear children. To these lovely sisters, every prophet of God has promised that they will be blessed with children in the eternities and that posterity will not be denied them.<br /><br />Through pure faith, pleading prayers, fasting, and special priesthood blessings, many of these same lovely sisters, with their noble companions at their sides have had miracles take place in their lives and have been blessed with children. Others have prayerfully chosen to adopt children, and to these wonderful couples we salute you for the sacrifices and love you have given to those children you have chosen to be your own.<br /><br />Now, my dear mothers, knowing of your divine role to bear and rear children and bring them back to Him, how will you accomplish this in the Lord's way? I say the Lord's way, because it is different from the world's way.<br /><br />The Lord clearly defined the roles of mothers and fathers in providing for and rearing a righteous posterity. In the beginning, Adam--not Eve--was instructed to earn the bread by the sweat of his brow. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a mother's calling is in the home, not in the market place.<br /><br />Again, in the Doctrine and Covenants, we read: "Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken" (D&C 83:2). This is the divine right of a wife and mother. She cares for and nourishes her children at home. Her husband earns the living for the family, which makes this nourishing possible. With that claim on their husbands for their financial support, the counsel of the Church has always been for mothers to spend their full time in the home in rearing and caring for their children.<br /><br />We realize also that some of our choice sisters are widowed and divorced and that others find themselves in unusual circumstances where, out of necessity, they are required to work for a period of time. But these instances are the exception, not the rule.<br /><br />In a home where there is an able-bodied husband, he is expected to be the breadwinner. Sometimes we hear of husbands who, because of economic conditions, have lost their jobs and expect their wives to go out of the home and work even though the husband is still capable of providing for his family. In these cases, we urge the husband to do all in his power to allow his wife to remain in the home caring for the children while he continues to provide for his family the best he can, even though the job be is able secure may not be ideal and family budgeting will have to be tighter.<br /><br />Our beloved prophet Spencer W. Kimball had much to say about the role of mothers in the home and their callings and responsibilities. I am impressed tonight to share with you some of his inspired pronouncements. I fear that much of his counsel has gone unheeded, and families have suffered because of it. But I stand this evening as a second witness to the truthfulness of what President Spencer W. Kimball said. He spoke as a true prophet of God.<br /><br />President Kimball declared: "Women are to take care of the family--the Lord has so stated--to be an assistant to the husband, to work with him, but not to earn the living, except in unusual circumstances. Men ought to be men indeed and earn the living under normal circumstances" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 318 ).<br /><br />President Kimball continues: "Too many mothers work away from home to furnish sweaters and music lessons and trips and fun for their children. Too many women spend their time in socializing, in politicking, in public services when they should be home to teach and train and receive and love their children into security" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 319).<br /><br />Remember the counsel of President Kimball to John and Mary: "Mary, you are to become a career woman in the greatest career on earth--that of homemaker, wife, and mother. It was never intended by the Lord that married women should compete with men in employment. They have a far greater and more important service to render.<br /><br />Again President Kimball speaks: "The husband is expected to support his family and only in an emergency should a wife secure outside employment. Her place is in the home, to build the home into a haven of delight.<br /><br />"Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment. Two incomes raise the standard of living beyond its norm. Two spouses working prevent the complete and proper home life, break into the family prayers, create an independence which is not cooperative, causes distortion, limits the family, and frustrates the children already born" (Spencer W. Kimball, San Antonio Fireside, Dec. 3, 1977, pp. 9-10 ).<br /><br />Finally President Kimball counsels: "I beg of you, you who could and should be bearing and rearing a family: Wives, come home from the typewriter, the laundry, the nursing, come home from the factory, the cafe. No career approaches in importance that of wife, homemaker, mother--cooking meals, washing dishes, making beds for one's precious husband and children. Come home, wives, to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home, wives, to your children, born and unborn. Wrap the motherly cloak about you and, unembarrassed, help in a major role to create the bodies for the immortal souls who anxiously await.<br /><br />"When you have fully complemented your husband in home life and borne the children, growing up full of faith, integrity, responsibility, and goodness, then you have achieved your accomplishment supreme, without peer, and you will be the envy [of all] through time and eternity" (Spencer W. Kimball, San Antonio Fireside, Dec. 3, 1977, pp. 11-12).<br /><br />President Kimball spoke the truth. His words are prophetic.<br /><br />Mothers in Zion, your God-given roles are so vital to your own exaltation and to the salvation and exaltation of your family. A child needs a mother more than all the things money can buy. Spending time with your children is the greatest gift of all.<br /><br />With love in my heart for the mothers in Zion, I would now like to suggest ten specific ways our mothers may spend effective time with their children.<br /><br />First, take time to always be at the crossroads when your children are either coming or going--when they leave and return from school--when they leave and return from dates--when they bring friends home. Be there at the crossroads whether your children are six or sixteen. In Proverbs we read: "A child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame" (Proverbs 29:15). Among the greatest concerns in our society are the millions of latchkey children who come home daily to empty houses unsupervised by working parents.<br /><br />Second, mothers, take time to be a real friend to your children. Listen to your children, really listen. Talk with them, laugh and joke with them, sing with them, play with them, cry with them, hug them, honestly praise them. Yes, regularly spend unrushed one-on-one time with each child. Be a real friend to your children.<br /><br />Third, mothers, take time to read to your children. Starting from the cradle, read to your sons and daughters. Remember what the poet said, "You may have tangible wealth untold; Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold. Richer than I you can never be--I had a mother who read to me" (Strickland Gillilan, "The Reading Mother"). You will plant a love for good literature and a real love for the scriptures if you will read to your children regularly.<br /><br />Fourth, take time to pray with your children. Family prayers, under the direction of the father, should be held morning and night. Have your children feel of your faith as you call down the blessings of heaven upon them. Paraphrasing the word of James: "The . . . fervent prayer of a righteous [mother ] availeth much" (James 5: 16 ). Have your children participate in family and personal prayers and rejoice in their sweet utterances to their Father in Heaven.<br /><br />Fifth, take time to have a meaningful weekly home evening. With your husband presiding, participate in a spiritual and an uplifting home evening each week. Have your children actively involved. Teach them correct principles. Make this one of your great family traditions. Remember the marvelous promise made by President Joseph F. Smith when home evenings were first introduced to the Church: "If the Saints obey this counsel, we promise that great blessings will result. Love at home and obedience to parents will increase. Faith will be developed in the hearts of the youth of Israel, and they will gain power to combat the evil influences and temptations which beset them." This wonderful promise is still in effect today.<br /><br />Sixth, take time to be together at mealtimes as often as possible. This is a challenge as the children get older and lives get busier. But happy conversation, sharing of the day's plans and activities, and special teaching moments occur at mealtime because mothers and fathers and children work at it.<br /><br />Seventh, take time daily to read the scriptures together as a family. Individual scripture reading is important, but family scripture reading is vital. Reading the Book of Mormon together as a family will especially bring increased spirituality into your home and will give both parents and children the power to resist temptation and to have the Holy Ghost as their constant companion. I promise you that the Book of Mormon will change the lives of your family.<br /><br />Eighth, take time to do things together as a family. Make family outings and picnics and birthday celebrations and trips special times and memory builders. Whenever possible, attend as a family, events where one of the family members is involved, such as a school play, a ball game, a talk, a recital. Attend Church meetings together and sit together as a family when you can. Mothers who help families pray and play together will stay together and will bless children's lives forever.<br /><br />Ninth, mothers, take time to teach your children. Catch the teaching moments. This can be done anytime during the day--at mealtime, in casual settings, or at special sit-down times together, at the foot of the bed at the end of the day, or during an early morning walk together. Mothers, you are your children's best teacher. Don't shift this precious responsibility to day-care centers or babysitters. A mother's love and prayerful concern for her children are her most important ingredients in teaching her own.<br /><br />Teach children gospel principles. Teach them it pays to be good. Teach them there is no safety in sin. Teach them a love for the gospel of Jesus Christ and a testimony of its divinity.<br /><br />Teach your sons and daughters modesty and teach them to respect manhood and womanhood. Teach your children sexual purity, proper dating standards, temple marriage, missionary service, and the importance of accepting and magnifying Church callings.<br /><br />Teach them a love for work and the value of a good education.<br /><br />Teach them the importance of the right kind of entertainment, including appropriate movies, and videos, and music, and books, and magazines. Discuss the evils of pornography and drugs and teach them the value of living the clean life.<br /><br />Yes, mothers, teach your children the gospel in your own home, at your own fireside. This is the most effective teaching that your children will ever receive. This is the Lord's way of teaching. The Church cannot teach like you can. The school cannot. The day-care center cannot. But you can, and the Lord will sustain you. Your children will remember your teachings forever, and when they are old, they will not depart from them. They will call you blessed--their truly angel mother.<br /><br />Mothers, this kind of heavenly, motherly teaching takes time--lots of time. It cannot be done effectively part time. It must be done all the time in order to save and exalt your children. This is your divine calling.<br /><br />Tenth and finally, mothers, take the time to truly love your children. A mother's unqualified love approaches Christlike love.<br /><br />Here is a beautiful tribute by a son to his mother: "I don't remember much about her views of voting nor her social prestige; and what her ideas on child training, diet, and eugenics were, I cannot recall. The main thing that sifts back to me now through the thick undergrowth of years is that she loved me. She liked to lie on the grass with me and tell stories, or to run and hide with us children. She was always hugging me. . . . And I liked it. She had a sunny face. To me it was like God, and all the beatitudes saints tell of Him. And sing! Of all the sensations pleasurable to my life nothing can compare with the rapture of crawling up into her lap and going to sleep while she swung to and fro in her rocking chair and sang. Thinking of this, I wonder if the woman of today, with all her tremendous notions and plans, realizes what an almighty factor she is in shaping of her child for weal or woe? I wonder if she realizes how much sheer love and attention count for in a child's life."<br /><br />Mothers, your teenage children also need that same kind of love and attention. It seems easier for many mothers and fathers to express and show their love to their children when they are young, but more difficult when they are older. Work at this prayerfully. There need be no generation gap. And the key is love. Our young people need love and attention, not indulgence. They need empathy and understanding, not indifference from mothers and fathers. They need the parents' time. A mother's kindly teachings and her love for and confidence in a teenage son or daughter can literally save them from a wicked world.<br /><br />In closing, I would be remiss this evening if I did not express my love and eternal gratitude for my sweetheart and companion and the mother of our six children. Her devotion to motherhood has blessed me and our family beyond words of expression. She has been a marvelous mother, completely and happily devoting her life and her mission to her family. How grateful I am for Flora.<br /><br />May I also express my gratitude to you fathers and husbands assembled this evening. We look to you to give righteous leadership in your home and families and, with your companions and the mothers of your children, to lead your families back to our Eternal Father.<br /><br />Now God bless our wonderful mothers. We pray for you. We sustain you. We honor you as you bear, nourish, train, teach, and love for eternity. I promise you the blessings of heaven and "all that [the] Father hath" (see D&C 84:38) as you magnify the noblest calling of all--a mother in Zion.<br /><br />In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jNz9pPvFuc4/UBAel35tGLI/AAAAAAAAAK8/_rXs2I_Kpkg/s640/blogger-image--1439987079.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jNz9pPvFuc4/UBAel35tGLI/AAAAAAAAAK8/_rXs2I_Kpkg/s640/blogger-image--1439987079.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator"style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mscV5lixuAI/UA74oON2ouI/AAAAAAAAAKw/dHGungPEhs4/s640/blogger-image--1502419494.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mscV5lixuAI/UA74oON2ouI/AAAAAAAAAKw/dHGungPEhs4/s640/blogger-image--1502419494.jpg" /></a></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/CTjiO/~4/LOuk3nahpKY" height="1" width="1"/>

 Shamus and Liam truly love eachother and their baby sister Madeline..I love this photo of the two of them. Shamus loved playing with his brother all week long during his Fall Break. 
 We are striving hard to  teach them to love eachother and you can tell that they truly do,  as captured in this photo below..As a parent it is truly beautiful to see your children truly love eachother and enjoying eachother's company..

 We also had a special visit this month from my Aunt, their Great Aunt Mary Jane. We enjoyed having her visit our home for the first time along with Great Uncle John. We loved hearing stories about our Great Grandparents. She looks a lot like our Great Aunt Peggy in this photo, who we miss dearly.

 Liam also completed a project for his class this month on primitive shelters. Liam chose to create a shelter on primitive tree people. Liam, his Dad and Grandmother made a fantastic project.  You put Grandma, Shawn, Liam and and a glue gun in the same room and the result is a fantabulous project! Liam was soo excited and he got an "A"!

Monson said: “If you are concerned about providing financially for a wife and family, may I assure you that there is no shame in a couple having to scrimp and save. It is generally during these challenging times that you will grow closer together as you learn to sacrifice and to make difficult decisions.”

 The most important thing a father can do for his [daughter] is to love [her] mother.”1? By the way you love her mother, you will teach your daughter about tenderness, loyalty, respect, compassion, and devotion. She will learn from your example what to expect from young men and what qualities to seek in a future spouse. You can show your daughter by the way you love and honor your wife that she should never settle for less. Your example will teach your daughter to value womanhood. You are showing her that she is a daughter of our Heavenly Father, who loves her.

 This blog is a electronic journal for my children and my children's children to someday read.. Recently Liam has been asking lots of questions about hs heritage and where his family came from..I recently received some beautiful photos from my cousin Mickey of my Grandmother Margaret McGinn, my paternal Grandmother, my children's Great Grandmother whom I never met. Margaret McGinn lived from 1910-1968, in Derragh, Ireland. She was married to Patrick Spillane, my paternal Grandfather who lived from 1905-1977.  Margaret is the Daughter of Owen McGinn and Ellen "Nellie" Kiernan.   Here are some photos of her home in Ireland.

We went to church today an had a visit from a very special Apostle, Jeffrey R. Holland.  We had a special Stake Conference that was held just so we could hear him and a member of the Quorum of the Seventy speak along with several members of our Apex, North Carolina Stake. We learned today some wise words that "Service is the Salve that Heals all. We also learned that when times are difficult do we remember that my grace is sufficient for thee? Sometimes we all fall short when difficult moments come but the pure love of Christ Never Faileth".
