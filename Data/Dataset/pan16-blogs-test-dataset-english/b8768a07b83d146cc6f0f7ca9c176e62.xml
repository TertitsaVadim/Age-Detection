The cottage belonged to <a href="http://www.evabreuerartdealer.com.au/artists/jean-bellette/jean-bellette-1909-1991">Jean Bellette</a> and her husband Paul Haefliger, who lived there in the 1940's and 50's. An award winning artist and tutor, Jean moved to Majorca with her husband in 1957 and never permanently returned to Australia. The cottage still holds many of her personal possessions. When Jean passed away in 1991, she bequeathed the cottage to NSW Parks and Wildlife service on the condition it become an artists' retreat. This generous bequest has contributed to an ongoing cultural heritage of artists visiting and working at <a href="http://www.hillend.org/hillend.html">Hill End</a>.<br /><br />Prior to the&nbsp;journey to Hill End my work focused on the ecology of landscapes, looking at contemporary issues of how communities shape environment through development and conservation. I went to Hill End thinking about the degradation of landscape I might see, over&nbsp;a century after the gold mining boom. It <strong>is</strong> there, still; but I found myself drawn to the cultural heritage that has adapted the ecology of Hill End over time.<br /><br />When I arrived at the start of Spring, wattle was in full bloom and many fruit trees and remnant orchards throughout the town were bursting with spring blossom;&nbsp;making for&nbsp;a striking juxtaposition of native and exotic flower. Peach, pear, apricot, apple and quince are just a few of the fruiting varieties, many of them planted over 140 years ago. Some stand amongst the rubble of building that they once were planted next to.<br /><br />My&nbsp;first exhibition of works from the residency focuses on this influence of culture and the idea of 'making home'. I am interested in the way this basic necessity of dwelling in a place, of making home and seeking comfort, the necessity of food and heritage of migration has shaped the ecology of Hill End.<br /><br />'Making home - softening the edges' is a large&nbsp;paper cut&nbsp;installation I made to fit the gallery wall space at <a href="http://www.sgar.com.au/home">SGAR</a>. This work features several exotic species which now&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;the fabric of Hill End. Elements of 'making home' are interwoven with plant species reflecting on the adaption and shaping of landscape, and our relationship to it.<br /><br />There are many&nbsp;unique qualities&nbsp;to Hill End. One is the&nbsp;opportunity to see stages of&nbsp;settlement in a place over several generations and the resulting impact of this on environment. The cultural heritage of adaption and introduction. Looking at the past has enabled me to reflect on&nbsp;the present. The choices we make today in shaping and adapting environments around us determines the heritage we leave for future generations. In ecology everything is connected....including time.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DsY9UF8wyTk/UVOKJdToHgI/AAAAAAAACH4/FNJs7xoMbuI/s1600/web+home_install+sgar_Culture+Ecology_nicola+moss+002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DsY9UF8wyTk/UVOKJdToHgI/AAAAAAAACH4/FNJs7xoMbuI/s320/web+home_install+sgar_Culture+Ecology_nicola+moss+002.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>'Making home - softening the edges(Hill End)'</em> <span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">©</span>2013.

Nicola Moss. Acrylic, natural ochre, charcoal frottage, hand cut papers. Collection of Moreton Bay Regional Council.</span></div><br />Last weekend I&nbsp;attended the opening of <em>'Drawing a line'</em> at <a href="http://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/subsite.aspx?id=111417">Caboolture Regional Art Gallery</a>. The exhibition presents works from the Moreton Bay Regional Council Art Collection featuring drawing as a medium, along with a selection of contemporary drawing works from artists around Australia. I really enjoyed this interesting&nbsp;show as line and various mediums&nbsp;have been&nbsp;interpreted in a broad sense of 'drawing'. From paper embossing, to sculpted ply and all manner of medium in between - biro, pastel, texta, charcoal, frottage, and ink. Artists on show&nbsp;include Lincoln Austin, Arlene Texta Queen, Godwin Bradbeer and Deb Mostert, along with works from the council collection by <a href="http://carlyscoufos.com/home">Carly Scoufos</a>, <a href="http://www.visualartist.info/sharonjewell2190">Sharon Jewell</a> and myself&nbsp;to name&nbsp;a few. <br /><br />There are a number of artist talks being held in conjunction with the exhibition, Carly Scoufos will speak on the 8th May and I will be speaking about my processes and inspiration&nbsp;on the 29th May, both 10-11am. If you are in the area and feel like coming along it will be lovely to see you.<br />'Drawing a line' continues till 15th June.

It's been a month of solid work in the studio, with new pieces coming together for&nbsp;my upcoming exhibition at Redland Art Gallery. I started work on this project - 'With or without' towards the end of 2011. An <a href="http://nicolamoss.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/on-art-camp.html">art camp week</a> at North Stradbroke Island&nbsp;in March last year provided a lot of source material in the form of frottage papers capturing the geology of coastal landscape forms; along with ideas around issues of&nbsp;biodiversity and sustainability in Moreton Bay.<br /><br />At the time I had thought 2012 might be a quieter year, a time for studio work,&nbsp;but quite a&nbsp;few other projects, <a href="http://nicolamoss.blogspot.com.au/2012_09_01_archive.html">residencies</a> and exhibitions filled the year....who am I kidding, it was flat out and provided a whole lot more inspiration and source material which will keep me&nbsp;creating for the next&nbsp;couple of years.&nbsp;(No complaints here.) So amidst this it has been interesting to have time now to return to a project begun a couple of years ago, to approach the papers and reference material with <em>memories</em> of the experiences and ideas. Without me realising it ideas for this project&nbsp;have&nbsp;continued percolating away in the back of my mind. It's been exciting to read back over my visual diaries and reignite the questions and thoughts that sparked my enthusiasm for this series in the first place. 'What is sustainability?'<br /><br />

I had only previously seen Sarah's work in magazines and online, neither of which do any justice to seeing these works in the flesh. I can only describe them as ordered chaos. There are so many bits, pieces, things, stuff attached, hanging, falling, connected, stuck, clamped and taped in these works, I really struggle to imagine how she puts them altogether. And yet amongst this excess of material and all it's forms of alteration....there is an underlying sense of order, it's not just thrown together. I visited on two different days and spent quite a bit of time viewing the works, there was something very compelling about these works for me.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0qxml4r7O14/UeuqB1hhETI/AAAAAAAACLQ/MKod97Cjlwc/s1600/Elisabetta+Benassi_detail_The+dry+Salvages.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0qxml4r7O14/UeuqB1hhETI/AAAAAAAACLQ/MKod97Cjlwc/s320/Elisabetta+Benassi_detail_The+dry+Salvages.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wSodR_PGGmI/UeuqNXlBj1I/AAAAAAAACLY/g9OozGpRA6U/s1600/Elisabetta+Benassi_installation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wSodR_PGGmI/UeuqNXlBj1I/AAAAAAAACLY/g9OozGpRA6U/s320/Elisabetta+Benassi_installation.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>This work by Elisabetta Benassi, titled 'The Dry Salvages',&nbsp;had an unexpected connection for me, which I'll get to in a moment. The work consists of an uneven floor composed of 10,000 'bricks' made of clay taken from areas of the 1951 Polesine flood. Each is imprinted with the names and alphanumeric cataloguing codes of the largest pieces of space debris still in orbit around the earth. I'm not sure I fully understand the connection between clay from a small town in Italy and space debris; but&nbsp;the week before arriving in Venice, Phil and I had stayed at a farm in Polesine and been told stories of the flooding that occurs there some years, to the extent where some years&nbsp;they have&nbsp;needed to empty out their cellars where the cured hams hang for drying. I was reminded of&nbsp;delicious food in a&nbsp;beautiful area&nbsp;of the Parma region while looking for names of space junk that I recognised. I wonder what the artist envisaged viewers contemplating. (On show in the Arsenale)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAA2lh626Oc/UeutvdUkuuI/AAAAAAAACLo/Z_VufpyVH7g/s1600/Sonia+Falcone_Campo+de+colour_2012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAA2lh626Oc/UeutvdUkuuI/AAAAAAAACLo/Z_VufpyVH7g/s400/Sonia+Falcone_Campo+de+colour_2012.jpg" width="286" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">'Campo de Colour' by <a href="http://www.soniafalcone.com/sf/index.php/en/artist">Sonia Falcone</a> was stunning to look at installed on the floor of the Latin American pavilion at the Arsenale. I could smell its aroma long before I saw it, consisting of pigments and spices it engaged my senses from a distance and up close.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFo8ERnk8vk/UeuxJUkgasI/AAAAAAAACMA/i1UTFaleLIM/s1600/Gallery+Cini_installation2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFo8ERnk8vk/UeuxJUkgasI/AAAAAAAACMA/i1UTFaleLIM/s400/Gallery+Cini_installation2.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This installation work at Galleria di Palazzo Cini was a bit of a surprise as there was no literature or information on site about the work. After heading up a couple of flights of stairs in a residential style building I entered a room and was immediately drawn to the 'masters' on the wall. Paintings from the early to mid renaissance period filled the walls of several rooms, including the stunning&nbsp;Botticelli piece pictured above (Left side on the wall). It took a few minutes for the 'contemporary' aspect of this biennale collateral event to sink in. I became aware of other visitors picking up poster prints from palettes that were situated on the floor within the rooms. Some people spent a great deal of time deciding which free prints they wanted to take, others took one of each, around 23 in total, without taking a second glance at the artworks on the wall. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The experience reminded me of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnOPu0_YWhw">youtube</a> clip that circulated on facebook not too long ago, with a renowned violinist busking with the worlds most expensive violin and almost&nbsp;no one stopping to listen. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I went back twice to see the 'treasures' and experience this installation by <a href="http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/person/edson-chagas/">Edson Chagas</a>, I liked it a lot! What do we value, the viewing of a work we can't take with us or a cheap print that's free to take? I left with a wry grin.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You can read more about this work at <a href="http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/venice-biennale-off-site-and-museums/">Art Agenda</a>.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2fOaLgPsmQA/Ueu1sOZyQ3I/AAAAAAAACMQ/UJjRthKuQWk/s1600/portugal.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2fOaLgPsmQA/Ueu1sOZyQ3I/AAAAAAAACMQ/UJjRthKuQWk/s400/portugal.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</div>I'll finish up with the yarn-bombing light installation of <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/joana-vasconcelos-2/">Joana Vasconcelos</a>, who transformed the floating interior of a Lisbon ferry brought to Venice for the biennale. It was a lot of fun...do I need to say anymore?<br />The work is titled 'Trafaria Praia' 2013.<br /><br />There were so many more installation works, but these are a few that caught my attention.

These are&nbsp;a few that caught my eye.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZIaGal8VAT0/UfTrRj6RoCI/AAAAAAAACNQ/JPlkcIlh_44/s1600/Jose+Antonio+Suarez+Londono+2_detail_Franz+Kafka_Diaries+II.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZIaGal8VAT0/UfTrRj6RoCI/AAAAAAAACNQ/JPlkcIlh_44/s400/Jose+Antonio+Suarez+Londono+2_detail_Franz+Kafka_Diaries+II.jpg" width="340" /></a></div><br />This is a small selection (detail) of the work by Colombian artist&nbsp;Jose Antonio Suarez Londono titled "Franz Kafka, Diaries II (1914 - 1923), 2000 mixed media. Jose began drawing a daily response to Brian Eno's diary, "A year with swollen Appendices" and has since moved on to the diaries of Paul Klee, Franz Kafka and Eugene Delacroix. Jose reads until he feels inspired to draw, paint or write. To date the artist has created 65 'Yearbooks' - his term for the notebooks containing his daily drawings.<br /><br />Many artists would be familiar with the practice and commitment&nbsp;of a drawing a day and I enjoyed seeing this work in response to someone else's diary entry. The work on each little index card is numbered and varies from sketch, abstract geometry and figurative to almost scientific diagram in style. Again I spent quite some time looking through these wonderful pages, some simple, others elaborate; en mass - quite special. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shWvQXpJ-3Q">youtube</a> has a section featuring Jose's work.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Z2-UvrCH_o/UfTyCi88xhI/AAAAAAAACNg/aTf8U9BJENk/s1600/Marco+Tirelli_Senza+titolo_2013.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8Z2-UvrCH_o/UfTyCi88xhI/AAAAAAAACNg/aTf8U9BJENk/s400/Marco+Tirelli_Senza+titolo_2013.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />This work 'Senza titolo' 2013, (Mixed media on paper, bronze, wood, plaster, mirror, glass, plasticine, clay, brass and burnt wood)&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.louise-alexander.com/artists/marco-tirelli">Marco Tirelli</a> is one of my overall favourites from the biennale. My aesthetic favours tonal contrast, so a whole room of black and white with some shades of grey was amazing! This is perhaps a work that could be looked at quickly and passed by, the individual elements have a minimal touch to them. But spending time in this room, within the work in a way, revealed so much more. There is a lovely play across surfaces of varied&nbsp;texture in 2D line drawing, printed and&nbsp;tonal work, overlayed with 3D objects cast and&nbsp;carved, and then the mirror and shelves add another element again. The overall composition and layout of the work is spot on, I could easily live with this work(s).

It was interesting to see a large wall covered with photographs of so many different breeds of pigeon. I looked at this work&nbsp;wondering how many of the breeds were still in existence today, are there still enough passionate breeders around to keep all the varieties pure and ongoing?

I had a week to absorb as much art as I could fit into eight hour days of observing. Even with a whole week of solid viewing I didn't see everything there was on offer in Venice....can't complain though it was amazing....for an art lover at least.<br /><br />I thought where else to begin a little wrap up of what I saw than with video art, in a sense the epitome of contemporary art now. Video art requires a commitment from the viewer, it generally cannot be surmised in a minute or two, rather it requires to be watched through. Without this commitment you could miss the whole point/ story/ connection of the work, as I did with my first passing view of the Greek pavilion (where "History Zero" by <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/stefanos-tsivopoulos/">Stefanos Tsivopoulos</a> is on show). Thankfully I returned and watched the three part series in full, realising the connecting human relationships within the three apparently random scenes. There were videos where I left thinking - well I'm never going to get that time back in my life again,&nbsp;fortunately these times were few, with&nbsp;the positives far outweighing the let downs.<br /><br />My favourite video work was "Grosse Fatigue" 2013 by French artist <a href="http://www.camillehenrot.fr/fr/work">Camille Henrot</a>, at the arsenale. The multi layered, almost collaged imagery of multiple simultaneous computer screen visuals represented for me the multiple worlds we occupy today, with virtual and reality spheres&nbsp;interweaving. Here's a link to the artist talking about her work (in French) and clips of her video on you<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYycsJz8vtc">tube</a>. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLV5yurcyTE/Ud_pP56PBiI/AAAAAAAACKI/bvTAPQmwgUM/s1600/video+arsenale.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LLV5yurcyTE/Ud_pP56PBiI/AAAAAAAACKI/bvTAPQmwgUM/s320/video+arsenale.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>This image above shows about one third of the arc of video projection that makes up the piece "Movie Mural" by <a href="http://www.stanvanderbeek.com/">Stan Van Der Beek</a>, an artist who lived in New York (1927 - 1984). He envisioned a project&nbsp;- the 'Movie - Drome' in 1965, which was not realised in his life time. This work is very much a collage of movie image and quite entrancing to watch as it filled my whole peripheral vision. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zkq3APYdL0/Ud_qdtoL_MI/AAAAAAAACKU/RO8LCrzqHC4/s1600/Kan+Xuan_Millet+mounds_2012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zkq3APYdL0/Ud_qdtoL_MI/AAAAAAAACKU/RO8LCrzqHC4/s320/Kan+Xuan_Millet+mounds_2012.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><a href="http://ucca.org.cn/en/exhibition/kan-xuan-millet-mounds-2/">Kan Xuan</a> created the work "Millet Mounds" 2012, a 171 channel video installation. Viewing this work felt like complete&nbsp;visual overload initially. The 171 videos flash through images simultaneously, documenting every known imperial tomb in China. Using a stop motion technique that involves stitching together hundreds of individual still photographs. I found it an exercise in focus and being still as each screen revealed a semi-travelogue effect of each site visited. The work was interesting and revealing in it's imagery, I could have easily spent hours working through the screens....but there's a lot to see!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1CFSeMbJBs/Ud_uvGENaPI/AAAAAAAACKk/yIKyK571NwY/s1600/orlan_the+freedom.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1CFSeMbJBs/Ud_uvGENaPI/AAAAAAAACKk/yIKyK571NwY/s320/orlan_the+freedom.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>This video work by <a href="http://www.orlan.net/">ORLAN</a>, titled "The freedom and two skinned-bodies" 2103 involved less of the flash through imagery of some works, rather is had a subtle metamorphose of imagery, x-ray like in some effect, where the visuals of head and face transformed through several partly layered phases. I liked the strong contrast and visual effects. This was part of a collateral event - 'The metamorphoses of the virtual - 100 years of art and freedom' curated by Roberta Semeraro.<br />Other video works that stand out in my mind/memory are those&nbsp;of <a href="http://www.richardmosse.com/">Richard Mosse</a>, representing the Pavilion of Ireland with his&nbsp;multi screen piece&nbsp;'The Enclave'. It was difficult to watch at times, I had that question in my head - am I watching it because it's like a car crash? The work features civil war in Eastern Congo with in depth scenes of refugee camps, conflict and death; all recorded in the psychedelic colour of infrared film. <br />And a piece titled 'Da Vinci' 2012 by <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/02/yuri-ancarani-at-the-venice-biennale-is-the-daily-pic-by-blake-gopnik.html">Yuri Ancarani</a>, which is not related to the famous artist, rather it features shots inside a hospital room equipped with cutting-edge technology, with the brand name of the surgical robot being the title of the video. You need a strength of stomach to watch this -&nbsp;fascinating, for me at least -&nbsp;video which&nbsp;incorporates the footage from internal body cameras working with the robot surgery equipment during surgery. Don't read any more if you are squeamish.&nbsp;In other words you can see a void of internal organs inside the body and then watch as a scalpel blade punctures through the tissue/organ wall to enter the cavity....and so it continues...curiosity got the better of me and I was engrossed.<br />These two video works left me pondering when does film/documentary become art?<br /><br />One of the things I now reflect on&nbsp;really enjoying at the biennale is that it combines work from earlier artists with that of contemporaries, creating wonderful relations and connections across time. This occurred in various media throughout the exhibitions.<br /><br />I'll post a couple more selections from the biennale shortly.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The upside of this is watching the garden flourish in greenness...if there is such a word. When I was away for a few weeks the vegie patch was left to fend for itself. And as I have found in the past, it can cope quite well without my attention, plants doing what they do. As long as there is some moisture&nbsp;everything keeps growing, flowering and seeding. I look forward to seeing this transformation when I return from a trip, rather than the incremental day to day subtleties.<br /><br />So the broccoli that wasn't barely a head before I left, has passed through the cooking pot stage to now be worthy of a vase. With bees buzzing furiously around though, I decided to leave them in the ground for now. The passionfruit crop has ripened and fallen to the ground. Oranges are being devoured from the tree&nbsp;by white cockatoos - they are definitely ready for harvest; and the mulberry tree is ready for pruning.&nbsp;Now I just have to be patient and hold off on the spring seed sowing.

The installation is visually dramatic, with recognition of 'rug' first coming to mind, but when viewed up close the carpet reveals a much more pixelated and abstract&nbsp;pattern. Within the gallery rooms the artist has sparsely&nbsp;hung monochrome oil on canvas paintings over the top of the carpeted walls - some are&nbsp;large abstracts; while another series features smaller more classical&nbsp;figurative works.

Memories of the place are still strong in my mind as is the inspiration I gathered. <br /><br />I've&nbsp;made a start to my next body of work, a series of paintings inspired by the ecology and cultural heritage of Hill End.&nbsp;This month has&nbsp;been a transitional time in the studio, packing away papers and&nbsp;reference material from my recently completed work -' With or without'. Re-organising the studio, pulling out the easel, revisiting journal notes, photos pinned back on the wall and ideas sparked again. I'm feeling excited and slightly nervous at this point...the anticipation of realising ideas and visuals in my mind, and at the same time thinking - "oh boy! It's been a year since I put paint to canvas" will I remember how? :-) Of course I will! but you know it's like an unknown starting point and&nbsp;anticipation of possibilities. I'm looking forward to seeing how the past year of paper cutting may influence the next series of paintings...I'll post some updates as the works develop.<br /><br />In the meantime here is something I've been working on with the 'left over' pieces of cut paper, I mentioned <a href="http://www.nicolamoss.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/details.html">here</a> that I'd have to work out what to do with them.&nbsp;This colour palette of Hill End papers&nbsp;is something I'll be referencing while painting.<br /><br />Now it's back to the easel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5ddCS76DCJ0/UixXTYrJXhI/AAAAAAAACSM/U4ZnVhw2_Kk/s1600/Hill+End_palette_Nicola+Moss_paper.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5ddCS76DCJ0/UixXTYrJXhI/AAAAAAAACSM/U4ZnVhw2_Kk/s320/Hill+End_palette_Nicola+Moss_paper.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />

All the works are wrapped and ready for delivery early&nbsp;next week, I'm looking forward to seeing them up together on the walls. <br />In the last week I've had some potent reminders of what inspired me to work on this project in the first place. The idea of sustainability, what does it really mean and how do we achieve it? It's a very complex area and yet some simple truths hold - everything living on this planet is connected, we are all part of an ecology that relies on relationships and dependencies between species and the environment around us. Sometimes the environment we draw on for our needs is global, the flip side of this is what happens elsewhere can and will influence us here at a local level.<br /><br />These thoughts were brought into focus when I read&nbsp;an article&nbsp;from the Newcastle Herald by Greg Ray. <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1848433/the-ocean-is-broken/">'The ocean is broken'</a>&nbsp;describes in a personal account&nbsp;the experiences&nbsp;of Newcastle sailor Ivan Macfadyen. Ten years apart Ian has sailed the same course from Australia to Osaka and then on to San Francisco but with very different experiences on the two trips. The article expresses it best and is well worth a read.<br />I&nbsp;am&nbsp;left pondering if we are choosing to live with pollution and without life.<br /><br /><em>With or without</em> takes a look at the conundrum of sustainability with a focus on biodiversity conservation and waste management - on a&nbsp;more positive&nbsp;note there are&nbsp;good stories to be shared as well!<br /><br /><br /><br />

Collecting native seeds for propagation with <a href="http://indigiscapes.redland.qld.gov.au/Programs/Bushcare/Pages/default.aspx">bush care groups</a>&nbsp;managed by&nbsp;Indigiscapes; sighting and recording bird species with the <a href="http://indigiscapes.redland.qld.gov.au/WhatsOn/Pages/Bushcare-calendars.aspx">monthly bird watching group</a>; and&nbsp;learning a little about the <a href="http://www.seagrasswatch.org/home.html">Seagrass Watch program</a> in a muddy encounter at Ormiston. Each outing has been a rewarding experience, getting to know a few of the locals, who are happy to share&nbsp;the wealth of knowledge they have about their local environments. It's also&nbsp;rewarding to contribute in a small way to the valuing of environments and the regions rich biodiversity. My first exhibition at Redland Art Gallery, <em>Plant-Life</em>&nbsp;featured several works exploring the&nbsp;activities&nbsp;and sites of&nbsp;mainland bush care groups. In <em><a href="http://www.visualartist.info/nicolamoss/2013-nbspwith-or-without">With or without</a></em> I have turned my attention to the intertidal zones and water ways of the Moreton Bay Marine Park.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mangrovewatch.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=300362">Mangrove Watch in Moreton Bay</a> is a partnership between the scientific community and community volunteers who undertake training and collect data. The monitoring and collected data from this citizen science program helps with determining change, which is essential for good management of the mangroves environment.<br /><br />Many of the programs are easy to get involved with, links are attached.

(I posted earlier about two works in this series <a href="http://www.nicolamoss.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/thoughts-on-paradox-of-sustainability.html">here</a>). This piece brings together several ideas relating to plastic waste and the food chain - our food chain - and those of other species. (Reading <a href="http://www.susanfreinkel.com/books_Plastic.html">'Plastic - A toxic love story'</a> by Susan Freinkel last year, made me even more aware of the omnipresence of plastic in and around our food stuff). </span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><span>I began by using some of the disposable plastic materials I encounter with the foods I eat, starting with the black polystyrene used in meat trays. I cut a motif of coral form, a life structure I have seen washed up on many beaches around Moreton Bay. Coral takes a very long time to grow and plastic takes an even longer time to break down. I enjoy eating sushi and began collecting the disposable plastic containers used to provide 'take away' soy sauce - the irony of these bottles being pressed in the shape of fish seemed appropriate for the conflicting thoughts. Plaited grocery shopping bags lead to a found object I picked up on Flinders Beach at North Stradbroke Island. It's the remain of a burst balloon, and unfortunately sea life such as turtles and birds mistake these for food when they are floating in the bay. Looks a little squid like perhaps?</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><span>Last year I volunteered&nbsp;in an <a href="http://au.earthwatch.org/">Earthwatch </a>program called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Turtles-in-Trouble/135936746452005">'Turtles in trouble'</a>. The project collects data which assists with research on the impact of ingestion of marine debris on turtles found in Australia. The morning was spent observing a necropsy of a turtle found dead, to establish the cause of death. Lead scientist Dr Kathy Townsend provided lots of information about turtles as we examined how and what they eat. Turtles can't throw up unwanted items they swallow and are mistaking plastic debris for food, research is showing this is not a random selection. </span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><span>We spent the afternoon collating data on plastic debris&nbsp;washed up on&nbsp;beaches at North Stradbroke Island. This is when it dawned on me that plastic waste never goes away, it just breaks into smaller and smaller pieces, with some gradually entering the food chain at several levels.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><span></span></span>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><span class="caption"><span>Answers are not easy, but I was very impressed with the practical approach taken by scientist. I think convenience is one of the big hurdles for me to make a positive change and accept less disposable plastic.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"></span></span>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"></span></span>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"></span></span>&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mjIINTGamw4/Uo6jSkXmIOI/AAAAAAAACVA/zTxIi158tNM/s1600/Contact_(RE+CON+series)_Nicola+Moss.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mjIINTGamw4/Uo6jSkXmIOI/AAAAAAAACVA/zTxIi158tNM/s320/Contact_(RE+CON+series)_Nicola+Moss.jpg" width="221" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="caption"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><em>'Contact (RE:CON Series)'</em> Nicola Moss ©2013.

It's been a weekend of activity with the exhibition opening of <em><a href="http://www.visualartist.info/nicolamoss/2013-nbspwith-or-without">With or without</a></em> on Friday night and artist floor talks today at Redland Art Gallery. Having an opportunity to speak with viewers of the exhibition and hear their thoughts and comments seems to me to be such an integral part of exhibiting and making artwork. What would the artwork be without&nbsp;a viewer? So I have enjoyed many conversations and savoured the feedback from friends and new acquaintances alike.<br /><br />I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow exhibiting artists at Cleveland&nbsp;- <a href="http://russellcraig.com.au/slipstream">Russell Craig</a> and <a href="http://dhage.com.au/index.php">Jo D'Hage</a> -&nbsp;for their kind words and support over the weekend.<br /><br /><br />

Courtesy of </span><a href="http://www.sgar.com.au/home"><span style="color: #4c88bf; font-size: xx-small;">SGAR</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">.</span></div><br />Thinking, thinking, thinking....<br />When I start thinking about sustainability, what does it mean? how can I achieve it?..or more accurately, contribute towards it in a small way in my day to day living, etc....I basically find the questions keep coming, one leads to another, none of them get an easier either. But I would like to find ways of resolving some of the contradictions I have in my own lifestyle, and so the questions continue.<br /><br />Don't worry, I do&nbsp;sleep at night. The thoughts are there percolating away in the back of my mind. At all different times and places, like every time I buy some meat from a butcher and wonder why it is so difficult to buy meat without plastic. Or when I consider my love of sushi and the disposable plastic soy sauce bottle ironically made in the shape of a fish. And most annoyingly when I come home with a plastic bag.<br /><br />I have made a series of works for my show <em><a href="http://www.visualartist.info/nicolamoss/2013-nbspwith-or-without">With or without</a></em> that represent some of&nbsp;these thoughts that are often conflicting in my mind.<br />I began with the humble plastic grocery bag in a work titled 'Grey matter'. It features one half of a brain filled with plaited shopping bags; on the other side is a paper cut of mangrove tree top. I have plastic bags in my home <strong>still</strong>! and I value the environment.<br /><br />I moved from the plastic bag to the green bag in my next work titled 'What does green mean?' There are a lot of thoughts and questions&nbsp;brought together in this work, beginning with the green bag label .."Made in China. 100% Poly Propylene." I started with questions of what happens to green bags when they wear out? Do they go to landfill? How do they break down? etc. There is a paper cut overlay of barnacles which references coastal environments of North Stradbroke Island where I made frottage rubbings of the rock shelf geology. I read about Charles Darwin's travels and visit to Australia, where he collected samples of <a href="http://nicolamoss.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/for-love-of-barnacles.html">barnacles from Moreton Bay</a>; and&nbsp;the drag effect&nbsp;barnacles have on shipping resulting in&nbsp;reduced fuel efficiency. On the other side of the brain I thought about being an artist and trying to be sustainable in the materials I use. I don't often work with upcycled/recycled/found objects in my work, it was an area I wanted to contemplate in this series. I chose fish scales as my medium, cleaning, boiling and piercing them to be sewn over the brain motif. As several people who have seen the work commented, they make a seriously beautiful sequin effect. This area of fish scales encloses a delicate paper cut of a chemical compound motif. 'What does green mean?'<br /><br />There are two more works in this series on show at the exhibition, I'll discuss them shortly. As with most art it's best appreciated in the flesh...so to speak.<br /><em>With or without</em> continues at <a href="http://www.more2redlands.com.au/ArtGallery/About%20Us/Pages/default.aspx">Redland Art Gallery</a> until the 8th December.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing any thoughts or questions you may have on the paradox of sustainability.

We can share all the usual good friend qualities with the added bonus of having an understanding and appreciation for each others creative practices. I guess I'm referring to peers. And I can't think of a better way to show this than by having some of their hand crafted work in my home. Last Friday I picked up my custom made, super comfy, Jeanbag from KT. Beautifully wrapped I waited to unfold it with Phil and fill with micro beads before the long anticipated lounge. I love it! When I buy, share, gift, swap&nbsp;a piece with friends it comes with a story, that's what makes all the difference. I know something about the development of the piece, it's inspiration and the&nbsp;work that goes into refining its qualities. There's just so much more to it than a trip to&nbsp;a store and home again. If you would like to read all about the development of Jeanbag, it's on&nbsp;KT's blog <a href="http://ktdoyle.wordpress.com/">here</a>; and this is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JEANBAG">Jeanbag page</a>. <br /><br />In winter this hall catches rays like a sun room, it's the warmest place in the house during&nbsp;that season. I'm looking forward to my studio breaks and book reading here. Thank you KT!<br /><br />Hanging on the wall behind&nbsp;is a painting called 'Illawarra flame' by Susan Buret. We've known each other for years and have swapped works with one another. I love the colours and pattern in this painting, it's from Susan's <a href="http://www.visualartist.info/susanburet/stolen-geometry-from-the-gardens-of-love-2010">'Stolen Geometry from the Gardens of Love'</a> series. Thank you Susan, still loving it!<br /><br />And all the other pieces from creative friends....and pieces yet to come :-) Thank you.

Making works for my upcoming solo exhibition at <a href="http://salt-art.com.au/about.html">Salt Contemporary Art</a>, Queenscliff, Victoria. I have&nbsp;continued working with&nbsp;inspiration from&nbsp;my residency at Hill End last year. It was such an interesting month being there; Hill End has a landscape where the passing of time and cultural heritage are completely evident and interwoven in daily life<span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">.</span> <br /><em>Nature waits for no one</em> features a series of paintings on linen and a selection of new&nbsp;hand cut paper works. I'm looking forward to seeing them up together on the gallery walls. On show from Sunday 29th December to Saturday 11th January 2014.

Listening to the hum of bees buzzing, calls of the Eastern Spinebills, followed by the sonic flutter of their wings. On my walk today I could smell the pine trees; many are budding up with new cones. Blossom is blowing off in confetti like drifts in the breeze.”</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"> I recall my first impressions of Hill End and Jean's garden as being rather magical. The <span style="font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">quince, plum, apricot, pear and peach trees, along with native wattle were bursting&nbsp;into&nbsp;spring bloom. A stunning cascade carried on gnarled branches, with shades of ruby red, pale pink, pure white and golden yellow.&nbsp; I spent time each day looking out at this garden or wandering around it. Taking lunch on the front verandah, in the well-worn and comfy chair, where many other artists and visitors have sat. There is a simplicity, a sense of being in the moment there. Hill End has a landscape where the passing and cycles of time are interwoven in daily life.</span></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Haefliger's cottage where I stayed during my residency belonged to Jean Bellette and her husband Paul Haefliger. They lived at Hill End in the 1940's and 50's. An award winning artist and tutor, Jean moved to Majorca with her husband in 1957 and never permanently returned to Australia. The cottage still holds many of her personal possessions. When Jean died in 1991, she bequeathed the cottage to NSW Parks and Wildlife service on the condition it become an artists' retreat. It's such a generous gift for artists today to share some time in this unique place.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><em>Jean's Garden</em> is currently on show at <a href="http://salt-art.com.au/gallery/">Salt Contemporary Art</a>, Queenscliff as part of my solo show - Nature waits for no one. </div><div align="left" class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"> ?</div><br />
