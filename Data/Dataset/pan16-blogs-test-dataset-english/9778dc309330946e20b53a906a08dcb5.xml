These high-end networks have the ability to track the locations of devices as they move around the network, but don't (until now) offer services that sites want to offer their visitors. Meridian fits perfects into that gap, offering apps that users run on their smartphones, providing mapping, navigation, content and other services.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5qhi_zx95UQ/UZXNEIBSfvI/AAAAAAAAfh0/vDrawS72bzc/s1600/Euclid+Aruba+2013-02-27+15.38.42.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5qhi_zx95UQ/UZXNEIBSfvI/AAAAAAAAfh0/vDrawS72bzc/s200/Euclid+Aruba+2013-02-27+15.38.42.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />Second, other network companies are already working to flesh out the services they offer. &nbsp;Last October, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/cisco-starts-off-acquisitions-of-indoor.html">Cisco acquired ThinkSmart Technologies</a>, a provider of location analytics technology that analyzes the trends and patterns in user movements within Cisco networks. Aruba is partnering with several companies for location analytics, including Euclid Analytics. Now the high-end network companies are moving themselves into the area of services.<br /><br />Third, Aruba has invested considerably into their location technology. &nbsp;They augment their <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2009/0082034.html">patent-pending</a> location tracking methods with a system that adds context about each device users, such as the device's role within the network (visitor, employee, manager) and the history of that device within the network. Integrating Meridian's systems will enable them to truly leverage that location data and offer services based on that data to users moving around the network.<br /><br />Lastly, the indoor location industry is now firmly in consolidation. A few months ago <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/03/apple-acquires-wifislam.html">Apple acquired indoor location start-up WiFiSLAM</a>. At the time we <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1320101-understanding-apple-buying-wifislam-and-what-s-next">predicted</a> that network companies, like Cisco and Aruba, would "acquire start-ups with particularly good services to offer sites, like navigation, promotions, couponing, and more." &nbsp;This prediction has now come true, and we expect to see other acquisitions soon.<br /><br />We wish congratulations and good luck to Meridian and Aruba, and look forward to seeing the next acquisitions in indoor location. &nbsp;Major companies like Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Intel, Texas Instruments, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and others, all have their specific gaps to fill in this area. Who will be the next to acquire an indoor location start-up, and which will it be?<br /><br /><i>Aruba's official press release is <a href="http://www.arubanetworks.com/news-releases/aruba-networks-maps-out-new-indoor-location-based-services-with-acquisition-of-meridian-apps/">here</a>, and Meridian's comments on their blog are <a href="http://nfarina.com/post/50427245962/meridian-goes-to-aruba-why-wifi-networks-are-the">here</a>.</i><br /><br /><i>For more on Grizzly Analytics in-depth research and intelligence on indoor location positioning technology, click <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">here</a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@grizzlyanalytics.com">info@grizzlyanalytics.com</a>.</i><br /><br /><br /><br />

What kind of wireless technology is used? &nbsp;If it's stronger than Bluetooth Low Energy, is there a radiation concern? More generally, are parents really more attentive to Twitter than to their babies? And is it good for a child's development to change diapers right away, denying them the learning experience of surviving a bit of discomfort and having the parent take care of them when they need? And while the diaper companies want us to change diapers instantly, can people really afford to?<br /><br />In the end, however, all these questions are&nbsp;irrelevant. TweetPee is one small niche product, but its impact is more than its product itself. It's impact is that it proves, yet again, that as new technology is made available inexpensively, the market will find applications. &nbsp;(For more details of TweetPee, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btOFcIgDG14">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.adverblog.com/2013/05/08/huggies-tweetpee-alert/">here</a>.)<br /><br />TweetPee is an example of what folks are calling "the Internet of Things" - connecting all sorts of sensors, appliances, and other "things" to the Internet. Most major mobile companies are working hard on the area, but until now it hasn't been clear why we want our mundane things talking to us, or why we want a lot of sensors sensing things in our environment. But as TweetPee shows, the Internet of Things has the power to hit us where it counts.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--XLt6rLZIz4/UYuAvXbn5II/AAAAAAAAfaw/k0c8ifuKRRo/s1600/Qualcomm+IOT+coffee+-+2013-02-27+10.51.31.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--XLt6rLZIz4/UYuAvXbn5II/AAAAAAAAfaw/k0c8ifuKRRo/s320/Qualcomm+IOT+coffee+-+2013-02-27+10.51.31.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />Another example of the Internet of Things was demonstrated at the recent Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference by Qualcomm. &nbsp;This coffee machine has integrated electronics that enable it to be controlled from its owner's smartphone or tablet. Personally, I would love this - Lie in bed and use my phone to start the coffee going downstairs.<br /><br />Qualcomm's work on Internet of Things, which they call the Internet of Everything, is in conjunction with an open-source organization they created called <a href="https://www.alljoyn.org/">AllJoyn</a>. &nbsp;Besides coffee machines, they're looking at controlling thermostats, televisions, pictureframes, alarm clocks, webcams, microwaves, cars, and more.<br /><br />Unlike TweetPee, Qualcomm's vision of the Internet of Things has the devices connected to the Internet, rather than communicating device-to-device using short range wireless. They've worked out technical details of peer-to-peer device discovery, with no central "home controller" needed. Connected devices enable control, notifications and streaming. Security is available, and devices are managed on a home-wide basis, based on the router to which they're connected. &nbsp;Their ongoing R&amp;D includes having devices controllable from outside the home, via cloud services.<br /><br />Qualcomm is only one of many companies working on the Internet of Things. In addition to major mobile companies, there are also start-up companies in the area that are coming out of stealth and poised to enable this new market.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rdWZ5Agj-PU/UYuF5ovpdEI/AAAAAAAAfbA/OBsAoRUTPKk/s1600/cubesensors.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rdWZ5Agj-PU/UYuF5ovpdEI/AAAAAAAAfbA/OBsAoRUTPKk/s200/cubesensors.jpg" width="200" /></a>One such company is <a href="http://cubesensors.com/">CubeSensors</a>, whose products include connected sensors for monitoring temperature, noise, light, vibrations and more, and send notifications based on pre-defined criteria. So you can know when your basement floor is getting wet, your closet door is opening, your kids are too loud, your car is moving, your freezer is warming, and so on.<br /><br />Several other start-ups are taking a similar approach, selling sensors that can be deployed to monitor and notify. Others are working on embedding technology into appliances, plug sockets and lights, similar to Qualcomm's coffee machine, so that they can be accessed and controlled remotely. Still others are working on embedding Internet access, either browsing or widgets, into every-day objects like mirrors, wristwatches, pillows and dolls. &nbsp;Several companies and industry groups are working on supporting technologies.<br /><br />Clearly there's a lot more to the Internet of Things than peepee and coffee. The technology is coming and its coming soon. But what applications will people really want? &nbsp;The only way to know the answer is to launch products and see what users like. &nbsp;Most importantly, the answers will come when these products get in front of real users, not techie early adopters. This is why we think TweetPee's release is a watershed event for the Internet of Things. TweetPee is telling us that the dam is about to burst on Internet of Things products coming to market....

In other words, it may be brinksmanship.<br /><br />Third, I still think that Waze would be more strategic, more transformational, for Facebook, than for other potential acquirers.<br /><br />Fourth, with the claim that the deal fell apart because of differences of opinion as to the Waze team's staying in Israel or moving to California, that's a bridgeable issue. &nbsp;Most high-tech companies have R&amp;D centers in the so-called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446541478/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0446541478&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=grizan-20">Startup Nation</a>, many based on M&amp;A. If Facebook wants to add social location to its mix, and up the ante on its innovation, this should be a deal-maker, not a deal-breaker.<br /><br />Of course, all this may be wishful thinking. &nbsp;See <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1439881-understanding-facebook-s-waze">here</a> why I'm a fan of the acquisition, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/05/google-following-facebooks-waze.html">here</a> for thoughts on Google's acquiring Waze, and <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/08/waze-and-google-maps-quick-comparison.html">here</a> for why I like Waze in the first place. &nbsp;Even if the talks are off, new acquisition rumors will come soon, because Waze is bound to be acquired. &nbsp;Will it be by Facebook? I'm still optimistic.

Google would presumably be easier on this subject, since they have several Israeli R&amp;D centers already.<br /><br />Second, I stick with what I wrote in a recent <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1439881-understanding-facebook-s-waze">article on SeekingAlpha</a> analyzing Facebook's interest in Waze:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Google is starting from the opposite end as Facebook but working towards the same goals - they have the popular mapping and location applications and are trying to gain a strong foothold in social networking. But for this reason, a Waze acquisition would help Google less than Facebook - it would improve what they have and move mapping in a social direction, but since they already have Google Maps, Waze wouldn't be as transformational an acquisition as it would be for Facebook.</blockquote><br />That doesn't mean, of course, that Google won't decide to use some of its cash on hand to buy Waze, both to improve Google Maps and to deny Facebook and others from catching up. The acquisition would also firm up Google's positioning on iOS devices. &nbsp;But it's a much less transformational and strategic an acquisition for Google than it is for Facebook.<br /><br />Third, all these rumors are great for Waze's user base. In October, 2012, before the Apple acquisition rumors, Waze had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/closing-in-on-30m-users-waze-goes-big-on-social-adds-facebook-sign-on-pickup-requests-location-sharing-more/">just below 30M users</a>. &nbsp;In February, 2013, after the Apple rumors, they were up to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/06/nav-app-waze-says-36m-users-shared-900m-reports-while-65k-users-made-500m-map-edits/">36M users</a>. &nbsp;Now, as the dust settles on the latest rumors, Waze is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/all-about-waze-why-google-or-facebook-might-want-it/2013/05/24/12b150ea-c467-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story.html">up to 47M users</a>. &nbsp;Of course, all those users may have joined Waze even without the rumors, since Waze is a great mapping and navigation app, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/08/waze-and-google-maps-quick-comparison.html">beating Google Maps in a number of areas</a>. &nbsp;But nonetheless, the rumors appear to be good for Waze however they turn out.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ptZEgLlWof8/UDX_jjZRXzI/AAAAAAAATrQ/comJ7yiYDZI/s1600/waze-airport-reroute.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="176" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ptZEgLlWof8/UDX_jjZRXzI/AAAAAAAATrQ/comJ7yiYDZI/s320/waze-airport-reroute.jpg" width="320" /></a><br />Fourth, regardless of M&amp;A, Waze is a great app. Besides using their crowdsourcing to provide great navigation routing, they're poised to exploit the social side of mapping and navigation in even more powerful ways. Whether they end up within Facebook, Google, Apple, or someone else, or keep going on their own, we have a lot of fun ahead of us in social mapping.<br /><br />Bottom line, my bet is still on Facebook, since I think they have the most to gain from Waze. But Google's such a heavy M&amp;A Goliath that it's hard to bet against them for any acquisition.

But for this reason, a Waze acquisition would help Google less than Facebook - it would improve what they have and move mapping in a social direction, but since they already have Google Maps, Waze wouldn't be as transformational an acquisition as it would be for Facebook.</blockquote>and here's <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/05/google-following-facebooks-waze.html">my follow-up</a> about a month ago:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">First, rumors say that the main sticking point in Facebook's negotiations is whether Waze R&amp;D will remain in Israel or move to California. Google would presumably be easier on this subject, since they have several Israeli R&amp;D centers already....&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">...Google [may] decide to use some of its cash on hand to buy Waze, both to improve Google Maps and to deny Facebook and others from catching up. The acquisition would also firm up Google's positioning on iOS devices.</blockquote><br />It's an exciting prospect to think of Waze being integrated into Google Maps.<br /><br /><b>The biggest aspect of Google's acquiring Waze, that I haven't seen discussed much, is that Waze technology could be incorporated not only into Google Maps but into Android</b>. &nbsp;What this means would remain to be seen. &nbsp;It might mean that all Android phones with Location Services activated could have their movements automatically analyzed for traffic pattern analysis. It might mean that Android calendars could automatically tell you how long it will take (in real-time traffic conditions) to get to your next appointment. It might mean a lot of things. &nbsp;Whatever it means, it'll definitely be exciting.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

They also presumably want to defend their position in mapping, making it worth a lot to deny Waze to others.<br />But is that really worth the rumored $1.1 Billion to Google, when they already have the most popular mobile mapping and navigation service? Clearly the answer is yes, but the question is why, and what it means for the future.

But many are speculating that Ruckus Wireless will incorporate YFind's positioning into its Wi-Fi access points, to track locations of any Wi-Fi enabled phone within range. &nbsp;(We explained the difference between positioning running on phones and in the network in <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/11/meridian-brings-indoor-location-into.html">this previous blog article</a>.)<br /><br />YFind's positioning uses more sophisticated Wi-Fi fingerprinting than many others, with probabilistic methods for handling areas between fingerprints and periodic fluctuations in signal strengths, both of which challenge basic fingerprinting approaches.<br /><br />YFind has also worked heavily on their analytics, in which "footfall analysis" analyzes where phone users walk and where they stop to look at things. This information is increasingly valuable to site owners, and both Aruba and Cisco have <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/05/aruba-acquires-indoor-location-start-up.html">acquired companies in this area</a>.<br /><br />Grizzly Analytics predicted that 2013 would be a year with acquisitions and consolidation of start-up comapanies in indoor location, and this is looking truer and truer each month. Who will be the next start-up to be acquired? There are <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">more than 50 more start-ups in this area</a>, so stay tuned....

Ironically, we wrote it then in the context of Intel's rumored acquisition of another Israeli gesture recognition company InVision BioMetrics, an acquisition that fell through. We're glad to see that Intel finally found the gesture start-up they want.<br /><br />Intel's interest in gesture recognition is not new. &nbsp;Besides considering a gesture recognition acquisition almost 2 years ago, they released the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzw2Xfxqkp0">video clip</a> below over a year ago, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/04/intel-announces-creative-depth-vision-camera-at-computex-2013/">announced a 3D camera</a> recently, and have been researching gesture recognition themselves for years.<br /><br />Their competitors have also been getting into gesture recognition: Qualcomm <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1259935">acquired GestureTek</a> 2 years ago, Apple is <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23668855/report-apple-talks-buy-primesense-which-was-key">rumored</a> to be in acquisition talks with Primesense (another Israeli start-up, whose technology powers Microsoft's Kinect), and Texas Instruments is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethwoyke/2011/10/31/texas-instruments-sees-big-market-for-smartphone-gesture-recognition/">working in the area</a> as well.<br /><br />So what's next in gesture recognition? One likely acquisition target is XTR (Extreme Reality), which was <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/11/gesture-recognition-deals-and-micro.html">rumored </a>to be in deals with Samsung and NEC. Another likely acquisition target is <a href="http://eyesight-tech.com/">EyeSight</a>, whose solution is purely software based and runs on standard cameras.<br /><br />Even more exciting to us, however, is the growing area of "micro-gestures" for mobile devices. &nbsp;<a href="http://umoove.me/getSDK.aspx">Umoove's technology</a> focuses on the user's face from a smartphone or tablet front-facing camera, and recognizes where the user's eyes are looking, head is tilted, etc. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pointgrab.com/">PointGrab </a>recognizes hands, both where they move and where they make a grabbing motion. Grizzly Analytics thinks that micro-gestures is going to make a big splash before the end of 2013.<br /><br />Congratulations to Omek - we look forward to seeing how their technology gets integrated into Intel's chips. Even more, we look forward to seeing how gesture recognition continues to evolve....<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kzw2Xfxqkp0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />

The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-16/samsung-said-to-introduce-smartphone-like-wristwatch-next-month.html">latest report</a> is that Samsung will be releasing a watch-like device called the Galaxy Gear next month, that can make calls, surf the web and read e-mails. This follows on months of rumors that Apple is releasing an iWatch.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KApVHi4BZrQ/UhCrHGOYXaI/AAAAAAAAiAQ/EB3o6EH-Hbo/s1600/2013-02-26+18.14.06.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KApVHi4BZrQ/UhCrHGOYXaI/AAAAAAAAiAQ/EB3o6EH-Hbo/s200/2013-02-26+18.14.06.jpg" width="200" /></a>One major company that's already released a watch device is Sony, whose SmartWatches were shown at the MWC2013 conference. Sony's SmartWatch doesn't operate independently, rather it connects to the user's smartphone and runs apps that display on the phone but run in connection with the smartphone. &nbsp;Examples include apps that connect to the Internet via the phone and display information in small format on the watch. Another example is the ability to control the phone's camera using the watch, for example, if the phone is on a tripod and the user uses the watch to check the image and take the picture.<br /><br />Here's a video of the Sony SmartWatch in action, from last spring's MWC2013 conference:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uAocTn76Hrw" width="420"></iframe> <br />Several other companies have also shown intelligent watches. &nbsp;Two are shown here, the Treviso from a company called I'm Watch, and a watch from Umeox Mobile:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XDzwleXyp68/UhCsOAogY1I/AAAAAAAAiAY/rvQ-VIq-W_o/s1600/2013-02-28+12.38.58.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XDzwleXyp68/UhCsOAogY1I/AAAAAAAAiAY/rvQ-VIq-W_o/s200/2013-02-28+12.38.58.jpg" width="200" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1dpjXHVkLY/UhCsv9I5umI/AAAAAAAAiAg/pK1Ss2u-SIM/s1600/2013-02-26+14.57.48.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1dpjXHVkLY/UhCsv9I5umI/AAAAAAAAiAg/pK1Ss2u-SIM/s200/2013-02-26+14.57.48.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />So far none of the intelligent or connect watches have been meant to replace phones - they all connect to the user's smartphone's for calling and connectivity. The rumors of the Samsung Galaxy Gear and the Apple iWatch indicate that they'll be standalone devices with their own connectivity, but we'll need to wait and see.<br /><br />This <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0263491.html">patent application</a> shows that Samsung's been working on watch-like mobile devices for at least six years. Other major mobile companies have been researching this as well. The fruits of this research may be reaching market soon....<br /><br /><br />

This is obviously huge for both companies.<br /><br />Nokia will continue to operate as an independent company, consisting primarily of three business units: Nokia Siemens Networks, the HERE location services and mapping (including Navteq) unit, and its research center. &nbsp;Microsoft will acquire the phone business and a ten year license to Nokia's research portfolio.<br /><br />There's a lot to say about this acquisition, and lots of articles are saying it. I particularly recommend these articles: this <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/currents/post/1255792">bottom-line summary</a>, this <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130902/microsoft-explains-the-rationale-behind-the-nokia-deal/">perspective from Microsoft</a>, this <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1668992-nokia-receives-a-fair-price-for-its-phone-business-and-improves-future-profitability">financial analysis</a>, and this <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1668922-the-stars-have-finally-aligned-microsoft-buys-a-chunk-of-nokia-and-why-you-should-hold-on?source=email_rt_article_readmore&amp;app=1">analysis of some of the details</a>.<br /><br />Taking a longer term view, however, I have some interesting observations. &nbsp;First, while everyone is looking at Microsoft's interest in Nokia's smartphone business, they must have a plan for the feature phone business as well. &nbsp;Second, Nokia released a hint that they might get back into the device business themselves, starting in 2016.<br /><br />I've written more about these observations, with my speculation for what both companies have in mind, in <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1669502-long-term-observations-nobodys-discussing-on-the-microsoft-nokia-deal">this article on SeekingAlpha</a>. &nbsp;Here's a taste:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Speculation: Microsoft is getting ready to release Windows Phone for feature  phones...<br />Speculation: Nokia has some radical new technology in their research labs with  the potential to revolutionize mobile devices, but it won't be ready until 2016,  and it will require a lot of cash to complete the research....</blockquote>See the article for the details....&nbsp;<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1669502-long-term-observations-nobodys-discussing-on-the-microsoft-nokia-deal">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1669502-long-term-observations-nobodys-discussing-on-the-microsoft-nokia-deal</a><br /><br /><br />

Many systems determine location based on Wi-Fi signals, either using fingerprinting or using triangulation. Many are using sensor fusion (also called inertial navigation), tracking location movements using device sensors. And an increasing number are using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons, where devices track their locations based on signals from dedicated beacons that are deployed around sites, again using either fingerprinting or triangulation. With over 50 start-up companies in our <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">comprehensive report on indoor location technology</a>, and more starting-up every week, virtually all are using one or more of these approaches.<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://wwwdecawave.com/">DecaWave</a>, a fabless semiconductor company developing indoor location positioning based on 802.15.4a-standard UWB (ultra-wide band) wireless technology. DecaWave's solution is hardware-based, so it's not something you can download to your phone today. Their chip is going to be launched in the market very soon. &nbsp;With 10-15cm accuracy, it will bring a new level of location positioning to industrial applications, and is poised to reach mobile devices soon.<br /><br />Most significantly from a technology perspective, <b>DecaWave's solution implements a wireless technology that's designed from the bottom up, at the wireless wavelength and encoding level, to support location positioning.</b><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4a">802.15.4a</a>&nbsp;is a wireless standard for peer-to-peer personal-area networks (PANs), running over ultra-wideband (UWB), which are wireless networks with a range of between 40 meters (in dense environments) and 300 meters (line-of-sight). 802.15.4a was designed specifically to include distance ranging, determining the precise distance that a radio signal has crossed, as a means of handling interference and reflections. DecaWave is about to be the first company to bring a chip to market that implements location ranging on top of 802.15.4a.<br /><br />UWB radio, as implemented in 802.15.4a, has several inherent advantages over narrowband radio (including bluetooth and Wi-Fi) in its use for calculating location by time-difference of arrival (TDOA) or time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. First, the transmission bursts of wideband radio are shorter, so their starts and stops can be measured more precisely. But more importantly, in real-world settings, where signals have interference, reflections, refractions, and often don't have line-of-sight, UWB signals will be more readable in the presence of distortions. This graph shows one example, when a reflected signal (shown in red) is received shortly after a primary signal (blue) is received.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LaB_Z7Ccau4/Um97JMeH6sI/AAAAAAAAkwE/m7S6pEtYTSg/s1600/DecaWave-reflection-graph.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LaB_Z7Ccau4/Um97JMeH6sI/AAAAAAAAkwE/m7S6pEtYTSg/s400/DecaWave-reflection-graph.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />This means that UWB signals are more likely to be received reliably when there are real-world distortions in signal reception. This is one of several ways in which 802.15.4a is designed for positioning. DecaWave's solution is not only highly accurate, but it reportedly delivers that accuracy 99.7% of the time, instead of the 80-90% reliability of many other systems.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that even Cisco, one of the biggest proponents of Wi-Fi, has acknowledged that 802.15.4a is better than Wi-Fi for location positioning. In <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2009/0213820.html">this patent application</a>, a Cisco Principal Engineer wrote that "the existing waveforms... for... 802.11 communication protocols do not allow for highly accurate or easily calculated TOA or TDOA location computations... There are other types of waveforms that are better suited... Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) waveforms are known to be advantageous for TOA or TDOA... such as is defined as part of the IEEE 802.15.4a communications protocol."<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KyN6n-eWkFY/UmO8JLc-JpI/AAAAAAAAjfs/C7CF07G2LzU/s1600/decawave-trilateration.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KyN6n-eWkFY/UmO8JLc-JpI/AAAAAAAAjfs/C7CF07G2LzU/s200/decawave-trilateration.jpg" width="190" /></a>In industrial settings, DecaWave's technology is typically deployed in <i>receivers</i> and <i>tags</i>. Receivers are radio beacons, at fixed locations, similar to Wi-Fi hotspots or cellphone antennas, that receive signals from tags and calculate the tags' locations. The tags are small devices that are attached to things that will be tracked. In hospitals, the tags might be attached to patient wristbands or to portable critical-care medical equipment. In office settings, tags might be attached to employee keycards, to office equipment like projectors, or to mail carts.<br /><br />Once a DecaWave receiver is deployed, it can measure the precise distance between itself and each of thousands of tags that are in its vicinity. <br />Each of these distance measurements is accurate to 5-7 a few centimeters. When three or more receivers are deployed in the same area, they can combine their distance measurements to determine each tag's exact location to an accuracy of 10-15cm.<br /><br />Of course, we've reported beacon-based indoor location positioning before, including a very high-accuracy system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) from&nbsp;<a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/12/quuppa-newest-and-oldest-in-indoor.html">Quuppa</a>. Other companies with custom BLE technology include <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/03/mwc-2013-sk-telecom-indoor-location-demo.html">SK Telecom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/02/indoor-location-technology-enabling.html">WiseSec</a>&nbsp;(more soon on the company that developed the technology in SK Telecom's system), and companies that have added BLE beacons to their existing Wi-Fi or sensor fusion solutions include <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/indoor-navigation-comes-to-iphone-in.html">PoleStar</a>, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/sensor-fusion-indoor-location-system-in.html">SenionLab</a>, Insiteo and others. Most of these BLE-based systems have the advantage of running on today's smartphones and tablets, although Quuppa's highest-accuracy system is also waiting for chipset changes.<br /><br />But industrial deployments are only the beginning. DecaWave is reportedly in talks with network and device makers about including their chips in Wi-Fi access points, smartphones, tablets and more. Just imagine your phone knowing not only that you're in the supermarket, and not only that you're in the snack section, but that you're standing in front of the Ruffles and not the Lays. If indoor location positioning with 10cm accuracy were available in a wide variety of indoor locations, what kinds of novel location-based applications would come next?

But Apple's acquisition of PrimeSense shows their choice of a hardware solution.<br /><br />The $256,000 question, of course, is what Apple is planning to do with PrimeSense's technology. Many are speculating that they'll incorporate it into a new <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1846532-apple-gestures-towards-the-future">Apple TV product</a>, noting that an iOS-based TV would essentially enter the gaming market at the same time. Others are speculating that it will be incorporated into Apple's laptop computer line, a similar direction as the technology by <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a>&nbsp;that is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57603586-76/hp-first-to-embed-leap-motion-tech-into-a-computer/">incorporated into laptops</a> by HP.<br /><br />We believe, however, that it's more likely that Apple will try to use the PrimeSense sensor to further differentiate its iOS devices. For example, Apple recently introduced its famous <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/23/apple-touch-id-patent-application/">fingerprint sensor</a>&nbsp;in iPhones. &nbsp;These sensors can be used for device security and for transaction security, but more importantly they can be used by 3rd-party applications for any authentication or security purpose. Motion sensors in iDevices could serve to control the device's scrolling and selection, but more importantly, could open up a wide variety of innovative applications. Innovative apps are, as we all know, the differentiation that Apple craves for iDevices.<br /><br />Could a PrimeSense sensor in an iDevice detect when a car got too close to another car? Detect the height and gender of someone approaching a wall-mounted iPad? Detect facial contours well enough to recognize faces? Perform therapeutic gait analysis by sensing leg and body motion? Detect when people are drunk?<br /><br />The possibilities appear endless for applications of PrimeSense sensors in iDevices.

Sometimes they manage this because they implement the device or feature better than others, sometimes it's because they introduce their own new twist, and sometimes it's just because they're Apple. But the power of Apple to legitimize an already existing area when they enter it is seen time and time again.<br /><br /><strong>A few months ago Apple launched a new concept that they called iBeacons.</strong> iBeacons are Apple's biggest foray to date into the growing area of indoor location services, and are aimed directly at one of the lucrative segments of this area, namely retail in-store mobile applications.<br /><br />What Apple is poised to do is legitimize, so to speak, the use of new hardware beacons in indoor locations for the purpose of location-based applications....<br /><br /><i>Read the complete article on the SeekingAlpha site <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1816772-apple-ibeacons-poised-to-legitimize-hardware-based-indoor-location">here</a>:</i><br /><i><br /></i><i><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1816772-apple-ibeacons-poised-to-legitimize-hardware-based-indoor-location"><span style="font-size: x-small;">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1816772-apple-ibeacons-poised-to-legitimize-hardware-based-indoor-location</span></a>&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i>

Their chip uses UWB radio to precisely measure the distance between two chips. If their chips are put inside "beacon" devices in a room, and also inside "tags" on objects that move around the room, a system can track the locations of the objects moving around the room very precisely, to within 12-15cm.<br /><br />We were unable to video a complete large-scale demo, because of the big crowd in the room, but we did get the following video that shows how precisely the system is able to track objects as they move around. The demo was done with four beacons in the corners of the room that are used to triangulate the locations of chips moving around the room. The demo as shown does not do any smoothing or post-processing of that triangulation.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fR2N1y6q2S8" width="420"></iframe> <br />DecaWave's chip is the latest in more than 50 solutions coming to market for <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">indoor location positioning</a>, using a wide variety of approaches. DecaWave's technology cannot be used on mobile devices until their chips are incorporated into those devices. But for industrial applications, and in the future if their chips are incorporated into mass-market devices, the precision that they offer is stunning.<br /><br />Another company offering very high accuracy positioning is <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/12/quuppa-newest-and-oldest-in-indoor.html">Quuppa (click here for a description and video)</a>. &nbsp;Several others, including&nbsp;<a href="http://bespoon.com/technology/">BeSpoon</a>, are in the works. Most other indoor location solutions are less accurate, estimating locations within 5-8 meters, but have the obvious advantage of running on today's smartphones.

(If you're new to indoor location, you can think of it as GPS that works inside.) Here's a quick look at what we predict for indoor location technology in the new year:<br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Proximity beacons will be center stage for the first half of 2014: </b>&nbsp;Since Apple's iBeacon announcement, companies have been in a race to bring BLE-based proximity beacons to market. These beacons don't actually deliver indoor location positioning, since they don't tell you precisely where you are, but rather they tell you when you get close to a certain place, like a small store, a department in a store, or maybe a key product. <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1816772-apple-ibeacons-poised-to-legitimize-hardware-based-indoor-location">Apple has a way of making a concept hot</a>, so proximity beacons are bound to be big for a while. But more than that, they have the advantage of simplicity - they deliver a specific function, namely notifying an app on your phone when you're close to something significant, and they do it reliably. And proximity beacon functionality can even be implemented on an iPad without any additional hardware. Geeks may say that location positioning is much more powerful, and they're right, but the simplicity and reliability of proximity beacons, along with Apple's blessing, will push them into the market strongly.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Indoor location apps will flood the market mid-year: </b>&nbsp;At the same time as proximity beacons are reaching the market, however, the number of companies bringing indoor location solutions to market is skyrocketing. In the previous <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">Grizzly Analytics report on indoor location technology</a> we reported over 50 start-up companies in the area, and our upcoming report (coming out soon) will add more than 30 more. Deployments are in progress at malls, major stores, exhibition centers, museums, airports, and other big sites all over the world, and many are set to launch in the upcoming months. We expect a spike in the number of malls and big stores that show you where you are on an app as you walk around. (See <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/12/geofencing-meets-indoor-location.html">here</a>, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/sensor-fusion-indoor-location-system-in.html">here</a>, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/indoor-navigation-comes-to-iphone-in.html">here</a> and <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/01/indoor-location-geofencing-and-retail.html">here</a> for some examples of these systems.)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Industrial applications will follow slightly after that: </b>&nbsp;In addition to the companies bringing smartphone-based indoor location to market, there are many companies developing technology for hardware-based indoor location. By the end of the year we expect this to start reaching market, with the chips being launched today integrated into devices 6-9 months from now. This will include systems for tracking employee keycards and office equipment, sports players on the court, people and equipment moving around hospitals, and much more. (See <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/10/decawave-high-accuracy-indoor-location.html">here</a> and <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/12/quuppa-newest-and-oldest-in-indoor.html">here</a> for two out of many examples.)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>By year-end, and into 2015, hardware support for indoor location will reach smartphones: </b>&nbsp;Major chip companies in the mobile area are already bringing chips to market that include indoor location technology, and by the end of 2014 we'll see these chips being integrated into phones by major phone manufacturers. This will include both technology similar to today's, based on Wi-Fi and motion sensing, and also technology that is more advanced. (See <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/02/broadcom-delivers-on-chip-geofencing.html">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/10/broadcom-licenses-metro-indoor.html">here</a> for some examples, but other chip companies such as Qualcomm, CSR and Samsung have entered the area as well.)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Start-up acquisitions will continue throughout the year: </b>&nbsp;M&amp;A in indoor location has already started, with acquisitions by <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1355281-apple-s-indoor-location-acquisition-it-s-about-apps-not-maps">Apple</a>, <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/05/aruba-acquires-indoor-location-start-up.html">Aruba </a>and <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1567482-ruckus-wireless-indoor-location-acquisition-goes-head-to-head-with-cisco-and-aruba">others</a>. This trend shows every sign of continuing. We expect to see Google acquire at least one company, maybe two, to add some strength to Android and Google Maps indoors. Microsoft is also likely to enter the area, to strengthen Windows Phone and Bing Maps. But other likely acquirers include phone makers, network makers, mobile advertising companies, and more.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>New innovations will continue:</b>&nbsp; With all this action in indoor location, new methods will continue to emerge as well. Will approaches like <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2012/02/more-indoor-mapping-positioning-from.html">modulated LED lighting</a> succeed in the market? Will one of the cellphone manufacturers or mobile OS makers acquire technology that delivers indoor location even without Wi-Fi or BLE? Whatever happens, there's no reason to think that innovation in the area is complete.<br /><br /><b>Other mobile innovation will continue as well:</b>&nbsp; Indoor location is increasingly related to the <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_07_IoT.html">Internet of Things</a>, which will continue to develop in 2014 and 2015. See <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1605452-Internet-Of-Things-A-Growing-Battleground-Between-Mobile-And-Chip-Companies">here</a> and <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1663452-arm-acquisition-races-qualcomm-and-intel-to-the-next-50-billion-devices">here</a> for more. Gesture recognition is moving forward, with a number of big acquisitions in the past year (see <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/11/apples-big-gesture-apple-buys-primesense.html">here</a> and <a href="http://grizzlyanalytics.blogspot.com/2013/07/intel-finally-acquires-gesture_29.html">here</a>) that will likely reach market in the upcoming year. SmartWatches will have slow market adoption, but that will pick up at the end of the year as they become more user-friendly and accepted in the market. All in all, it will be an exciting year for mobile!<br /><br /><i>For more information on our upcoming update to our <a href="http://www.grizzlyanalytics.com/report_2013_03_indoor_tech.html">report on indoor location technology</a>, e-mail <a href="mailto:info@grizzlyanalytics.com">info@grizzlyanalytics.com</a>.&nbsp;</i></div>
