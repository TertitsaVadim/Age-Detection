People somehow wanted to say only positive things. But the negative things do exist; that is a fact. The fact that one can change and allow oneself to be changed through penance is a positive gift. The early Church viewed it in this way also. It is imperative now really to start over in the spirit of penance—and at the same time not to lose our joy in the priesthood but to recover it again.</dir><br /><div style="text-align: right;">Pope Benedict XVI, <i>Light of the World</i>, p. 35</div>

Pope Benedict will become the first pope to resign <a href="http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=663901" target="_blank">since Gregory XII</a> in 1415.<br /><br />Taking over in the large shadow of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI has nonetheless been a "great" himself. His theological contributions to the Church, efforts to forge unity, restoration of the liturgy and implementation of the vision of Vatican II, bringing the Gospel into the social media, and so on, speak for themselves. There is no greater theologian pope in recent centuries. The successes of these past eight years will not be fully perceived by our generation. Here is the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2013/february/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20130211_declaratio_en.html" target="_blank">declaratio</a> on the Vatican page.<br /><br /><br /><br /><dir><i>Dear Brothers,</i></dir><dir>I have convoked you to this Consistory, not only for the three canonizations, but also to communicate to you a decision of great importance for the life of the Church. After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God, I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry. I am well aware that this ministry, due to its essential spiritual nature, must be carried out not only with words and deeds, but no less with prayer and suffering. However, in today’s world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the barque of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me. For this reason, and well aware of the seriousness of this act, with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome, Successor of Saint Peter, entrusted to me by the Cardinals on 19 April 2005, in such a way, that as from 28 February 2013, at 20:00 hours, the See of Rome, the See of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a Conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.</dir><dir>Dear Brothers, I thank you most sincerely for all the love and work with which you have supported me in my ministry and I ask pardon for all my defects. And now, let us entrust the Holy Church to the care of Our Supreme Pastor, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and implore his holy Mother Mary, so that she may assist the Cardinal Fathers with her maternal solicitude, in electing a new Supreme Pontiff. With regard to myself, I wish to also devotedly serve the Holy Church of God in the future through a life dedicated to prayer.</dir><dir><i>From the Vatican, 10 February 2013</i></dir><br /><br />Don't we all wish we had Pope Benedict's defects? Though Pope Benedict may be stepping down because of declining health and strength, the Church today is stronger, healthier, and more unified than it was in 2005. The Church, as always, is in the hands of the Holy Spirit, Who has guided her mightily through the ages. Through the intercession of Our Lady, I am confident that the next pope will continue to pursue the vision of the Holy Spirit for our day. For now, I hope that we will all save the discussion of who we think is going to be the next pope until the conclave. Let us enjoy the final weeks of Benedict XVI's excellent pontificate.<br /><br /><i>Viva Papa Benedetto!</i><br /><br />For more, see <a href="http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2013/02/b16-announces-resignation.html?m=1" target="_blank"><i>Whispers in the Loggia</i></a>.

This is a difficult time for Catholics, including myself. We cannot exactly count on sensitivity from the secular press at this time! In an effort to sort of "disconnect" for a day, yesterday after Mass, I read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586176064/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1586176064&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thechafir-20"><i>Light of the World</i></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thechafir-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1586176064" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> in its entirety. I had previously read only portions, but this time I could not put it down. I was looking in particular for his insight regarding the question of papal resignation.  I found it on pp. 29-30 (interviewer Peter Seewald in italics, Pope Benedict in plain text):<br /><br /><dir><i>The great majority of these [abuse] cases took place decades ago. Nevertheless they burden your pontificate now in particular. Have you thought of resigning?</i></dir><dir>When the danger is great one must not run away. For that reason, now is certainly not the time to resign. Precisely at a time like this one must stand fast and endure the difficult situation. That is my view. One can resign at a peaceful moment or when one simply cannot go on. But one must not run away from danger and say that someone else should do it (<i>Light of the World</i>, p. 29).</dir><br /><br />This seems proof positive that Pope Benedict is not resigning on account of the abuse scandals, to say the least, despite what those in the foreign press have been alleging over the past week. His letter to the Church in Ireland included in the book also shows how strong has been the Pope’s voice for the victims. Moreover, <a href="http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/jesuit-expert-calls-benedict-great-reformer-sex-abuse#.USJgXffJAZc.twitter" target="_blank">John Allen’s interview with Jesuit Fr. Hans Zollner</a> helps to shed light on the Holy Father’s pursuit of justice for victims of abuse. That there are those who allege he should face some sort of public trial is shameful and dishonest to the magnitude of good that Cardinal Ratzinger was able to effect while head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and now as Pope. Pope Benedict deserves nothing but praise and honor for his creating a healthier Church that is intolerant of sexual abuse. Where some local bishops failed, he succeeded in punishing offenders, creating healthier environments within the Church, and bringing healing to a hurting world. Throughout his papacy, he has even borne the shame of the the abuser priests and of bishops who did not do enough, accepting accountability on behalf of the Church and issuing apologies to hurting victims. Cleaning up this "filth" in the Church has no doubt taken its toll on Benedict and upon his health.<br /><br />Back to the question of resignation, Pope Benedict addresses it further in <i>Light of the World</i>: <br /><br /><dir><i>Is it possible then to imagine a situation in which you would consider a resignation by the Pope appropriate?</i></dir><dir>Yes. <b>If a Pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically, and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has the right and, under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign</b> (<i>Light of the World</i>, p. 30, my emphasis).</dir><br /><br />This is clearly the reason for Benedict’s resignation (interesting comments <a href="http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/1984/resign_renounce_or_abdicate_bishop_paprocki_weighs_in.aspx#.USKtP2dhjIg">here from Bishop Paprocki on the terminology of resign/renounce/abdicate</a>), and the media need set aside all conspiracy theories. Moreover, the day he announced his resignation to the world, Feb. 11, is the Church's "World Day of the Sick." At 85, his health is waning, says <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-pope-blesses-thousands-20130217,0,589861.story" target="_blank">the same interviewer quoted yesterday in the Los Angeles Times</a>:<br /><br /><dir>New evidence is emerging of Benedict’s declining physical condition. Peter Seewald, a German journalist who has interviewed Benedict on numerous occasions, said that when he last saw the pope 10 weeks ago, his hearing had deteriorated and he appeared to have gone blind in his left eye.</dir><dir>“His body had become so thin that the tailors had difficulty in keeping up with newly fitted clothes. ... I'd never seen him so exhausted-looking, so worn down,” he told Focus, a German magazine, on Saturday.</dir><dir>Seewald quoted the pope as saying: “I'm an old man and the strength is ebbing. I think what I've done is enough.” Asked if he was considering retiring, Benedict replied, “That depends on how much my physical strength will force me to that.”</dir><br /><br />Pray for the Pope! He is being understandably silent about the nature of his health condition.<br /><br />I would also encourage all of my fellow Catholics not to let the secular media write the narrative of Pope Benedict’s papacy into your memory. This was an embattled papacy, to be sure, with enemies amassed against him from within and from without, which is a sure sign of the favor of Jesus Christ, Who said “Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you” (Jn 15:20). The secular media are not the ones who have the privilege of writing the narrative of Pope Benedict’s papacy. His words and deeds speak volumes (literally) for themselves. He will be remembered as the bridge-builder pope (the pontifex), who brought the Church into the digital age and into a new evangelization, who brought Catholics closer than ever with Orthodox, Jews, and even Muslims (despite the firestorm originally generated by the misinterpretation of his Regensburg comments), who reformed the liturgy and who helped implement the vision of Vatican II, and whose erudition and copious works, especially the <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i> series and his encyclicals, will be read by generations of Christians not yet born. His contributions to the Church of Christ will only be rightfully measured by those generations yet to come, who I believe will surely declare him as one of the greatest pontiffs of the modern era.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvGA45T9Mk/USKxv35K1wI/AAAAAAAAAxU/k8CL6KrHL5Y/s1600/Benedict+red+shoes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gPvGA45T9Mk/USKxv35K1wI/AAAAAAAAAxU/k8CL6KrHL5Y/s320/Benedict+red+shoes.jpg" width="320" /></a>These have been nearly eight years of abundance and wealth for the Church. I will truly miss everything about him—his gloriously rich theological homilies and messages, his authoritative and undisturbed presence, the Latin tweets, the red shoes, and most especially his voice, no longer ours but now belonging to God in prayer. May He grant peace to his remaining years and a well-deserved rest from his labors!<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=thechafir-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=1586176064" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></iframe>

We all have our guesses. Yours is as good as mine. I'll share with you mine below. But first let's consider the abundance of possibilities!<br /><br />The Catholic geek in me would love to see an <b>Urban IX</b>. What about <b>Anastasius V</b>? Ooh, that's nice! And when is someone going to come along and claim the name <b>Sixtus VI</b>? That itself would be a bold move. Benedict XVI resigned after having visited a couple of years prior the tomb of Pope St. Celestine V. The Pope who followed him was Boniface VIII. Whoever chooses <b>Boniface X</b> will have to redeem the name from some of his predecessors (Dante had Boniface VIII in the 8th circle of hell). <b>Celestine VI</b>? No, probably not. What about <b>Peter II</b>? Not a chance. That name is too loaded thanks to the prophecy attributed to St. Malachy. If the Pope is looking for something eschatological, how about <b>Telesphorus II</b>? That name means "bringing to an end."<br /><br />Let's look at some of the more probable ones, after which I will make my <b>bold</b> prediction:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Pius XIII</b>--This name bears a lasting and excellent legacy. The truth of Pius XII's work to save Jews during WWII would make this choice good for relations with them (although the media will continue to try to smear Pius XII's name by clinging to the long-debunked black legend). Particularly if reunion with SSPX is a goal of the next pontificate, this name would be a worthy choice. This choice is quite likely.</li><li><b>Leo XIV</b>--Leo XIII was the oldest pope and the third-longest reigning pope. Leo XIII famously heard the discussion between God and Satan in which the evil one requested 100 years to destroy the Church. After the conversation, he wrote the prayer to St. Michael the Archangel to be prayed after every Mass. Some have theorized that this 100 years began around 1916 or 1917 and the Fatima apparitions. This would be quite a prophetic choice.</li><li><b>John XXIV</b>--John XXIII called the Second Vatican Council. If a Pope chose XXIV, the media would be uproariously ebullient that the newly elected Holy Father would call a Third in which they themselves would be able to settle matters of Church doctrine once and for all. I think this choice is a bit unlikely, particularly since the past two popes have chosen names to pick up with the legacies of their most recent name-bearers.</li><li><b>Benedict XVII</b>--This name would be unlikely if an elderly pope is chosen, but may be more probable if a younger pope is chosen, as a way of showing continuity in the face of sharp distinction.</li><li><b>Gregory XVII</b>--This would be an intriguing choice. Gregory means awake or watchful. With the world in increasing turmoil, financial distress, upheaval in nature, and corruption in politics, we need a watchful Pope like Benedict XVI. Gregory XVI was also an advocate for human rights, condemning the slave trade with a papal bull of 1839.</li><li><b>John Paul III</b>--This name, I think, is less likely than Pius, Benedict, or Leo. But then, who am I? There would be a lot of excitement in the choice of this name, particularly as the memory of John Paul II lives vividly in our hearts.</li><li><b>Francis I</b> / <b>Dominic I</b>--It's going to happen someday. Another Franciscan or a Dominican is going to be elected at some point (although there have not been <i>that</i> many) and he is going to take one of these names. I think we'll first have a <b>Dominic I</b>. Just a hunch.</li><li><b>Thomas I</b> / <b>Augustine I</b>--Pure Catholic awesome! May it happen someday. There are so many great saints who would be worthy choices for a <b>I</b>. Chrysostom? Bonaventure? Maximus? Ignatius? Justin? Irenaeus?  </li></ul><br />My <b>bold</b> prediction: <i>The next Holy Father will be</i>...<br /><br /><h3><b>Pope Paul VII</b>.&nbsp;</h3><br />What better way to continue in the theme of the new evangelization than to take upon himself the name of the primary evangelist to the gentiles? The world needs a St. Paul figure, a writer, a journeyman, to stand in the Areopagoi of today to proclaim the message boldly and with all power and apostolic zeal of the Petrine office. Benedict XVI resigned in anticipation of these types of abilities in the next Holy Father. Less than three months ago, Paul VI was declared venerable. Benedict XVI also pulled heavily from Paul VI's <i>Populorum Progressio</i> in his final encyclical <i>Caritas in Veritate</i>. I think this name is the perfect choice.<br /><br />But then again I remind you, who am I? Your guess is as good as mine!<br /><br />________________________<br /><br /><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Update, 3/13/13</b></span>:&nbsp; So I was off with this prediction. Further, my "hunch" was wrong, too! I love how the Lord takes the extra step to keep me humble. He has a lot of work to do, as you can tell. As to my "bold" predictions, I guess I was 2 for 3 (or should I say 2 for 4 thanks to my "hunch"). Not bad.

Most Popes, in fact, have been from Italy, which makes sense. He is the Bishop of Rome.<br /><br />My <b>bold</b> prediction:<br /><br /><h3>The next Holy Father will neither come from Italy nor even Europe, but from elsewhere.</h3><br />I realize that there are many good and worthy European candidates—Schola, Schönborn, Erdö. One of these may be chosen. But I think that it is only a matter of time before the Church looks to the East, to the West, or to the South. It seems to me (and again, what do I know?), that the time is right. The Church is booming and lively in Africa. A great many Catholics live in Latin America and the next World Youth Day is in Brazil (consider that the 2005 WYD was in Köln, Germany, and the preceding conclave selected a German). The Philippines and India are epicenters of Catholic devotion and strength in Asia.<br /><br />It may seem like I’m not going out on much of a limb here. But think about it. The last non-European Pope was—again, correct me if I am mistaken, as I may be—Pope Gelasius I of Africa. Now, that was from c. 492-496. The world was vastly different. If the average age of the conception of our ancestors was 25, we would have to go back about 60 generations! Muhammed’s parents had not even been born!<br /><br />The world seems to share this excitement that this could happen, but I do not think that many people truly grasp how huge this will be. The media will seize upon this kind of change and of course spin this as though the cardinals are voting for doctrinal change. But no matter who is chosen, the media and the "progressives" will discover how strong is the church's continuity in the midst of change. Some may be disappointed, but the world’s Catholics will not be once they see the next Holy Father.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if this sort of change is on the horizon, the conclave <i>may be</i> longer than usual, and, of course, we must <b>fast and pray intensely</b> for the cardinals!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br /><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Correction</b></span>: There were three Popes from Syria in the 700s, so there has not been a non-European Pope since 741.

Did you think I was going to predict which Cardinal was going to be chosen? How on earth should I know? Really, look at the list of papabili; your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />A number of things give me comfort concerning the imminent conclave, but I will list just three of them:<br /><br />1. <b>The fidelity of the Lord</b>, who made the promise: <br /><br /><br /><dir>“I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Mt. 16:18-19).</dir><br /><br /><br /><dir>“...and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age” (Mt. 28:20).</dir><br /><br /><br /><dir>“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you (????) [i.e., the twelve], that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you (???) [i.e., Simon] that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren” (Lk 22:31-32).</dir><br /><br /><br /><dir>“I have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</dir><br /><br />2. The <b>transformation of Peter in the Holy Spirit</b> of Pentecost in Acts:<br /><br /><br /><dir>“Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them...” (Acts 2:1 ff).</dir><br /><br /><dir>“Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said ...” (Acts 4:8)</dir><br /><br />This was the same apostle who fled to weep bitterly after having denied Jesus. Because the sanctification of the Church through Peter is accomplished in the Holy Spirit, we have nothing to fear. <br /><br />Peter himself of all Jesus’ disciples might not have been a papabile in his own conclave (had there been conclaves at the time)—strengths: zeal, faith; weaknesses: denied Jesus three times, simple fisherman, puts foot in mouth at times, not on Twitter. What I am saying is that a perceived weak candidate could be selected and God will use his weaknesses for the strength of the body, that is, the Church.<br /><br />No matter who walks out on the balcony over the next week or more, Catholics know this in their faith-filled hearts. After all, who needs God if a candidate with no weaknesses emerges to lead the Church on his own? He will be weak. He will be a "sinful man" (Lk 5:8), but he will also be a holy man. The media have yet to learn this, and so will focus upon the man’s weaknesses (which, by the way, they hope to manipulate and exploit), but in the power and majesty of our God, who is faithful and true to his promises, we may be assured of the stability and strength of the Church, led by Peter under the patronage of Our Lady. <br /><br />3. Pope emeritus Benedict XVI knew this truth, and so he said the following, which should give us all comfort: “And among you, in the College of Cardinals, there is also the future pope to whom today I promise my unconditional reverence and obedience.” Among his last messages to us is the message of the peace of <b>reverence</b> and <b>obedience</b> to the Holy Father, to whom even Pope Benedict subjects himself.<br /><br /><h3>The Pope will be Catholic, that is, orthodox.</h3><br />The next pope, whoever he may be, will be Peter. He will be orthodox; it’s the guarantee of Jesus. Peter passes on the truth of the faith—it’s the divinely sealed guarantee of Pentecost. Really, who knows what name he will choose or where he will be from? This, however, is one projection you can take to the bank.<br /><br />John Paul II: "Be not afraid!"&nbsp; Benedict XVI: "Follow me."&nbsp; As the shepherd who stands in the place of the Shepherd addresses the sheep, we need not fear. We will recognize the voice of the one who has called us, to whom we must answer.

After all, I chose the name of Francis for my confirmation name way back when. My reasoning back then: I wanted to honor the Francis trifecta: F. of Assisi, F. Xavier, F. de Sales. It's interesting for me to attend Masses regularly in Orange County, wherein I hear "... for Francis our Pope, Kevin our bishop ..." — it's causing me to remember something I should not have set aside for my disdain for Catholic sentimentalism.<br /><br />Alright, Lord, alright. I can take Your hint.&nbsp; This morning, I read through some of Francis's prayers from <i>The Writings of Saint Francis of Assisi</i> (tr. Robinson, OFM, 1906) on my <i>Logos Bible Software</i>. I came upon the <i>Canticle of the Sun</i>, rendered into a more literal English.<br /><br />Here’s a stanza one never hears:<br /><br /><br /><dir>“Woe to them who die in mortal sin” ~<i>Canticle of the Sun</i>, St. Francis of Assisi</dir><br /><br />That’s right, that's from the <i>Canticle of the Sun</i>. To quote my toddler: "Zowie!"<br /><br />The full stanza:<br /><br /><br /><dir>Praised be my Lord for our sister, the bodily death,<br />From the which no living man can flee.<br />Woe to them who die in mortal sin;<br />Blessed those who shall find themselves in Thy most holy will,<br />For the second death shall do them no ill.</dir><br /><br />That's no 14th century redaction! Read the whole canticle <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/wosf/wosf22.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

This is one of the most relevant and prophetic speeches concerning the dangers of modernism and secular humanism that I have read. It is prophetic, courageous, and needs to be part of the cultural education of the youth of this country. It's not only a speech that shares what is wrong with America and the West in general, but why there remains reason for hope and ascent. Please take the time to read in full. You will be both grateful and inspired.<br /><br /><b>A World Split Apart — Commencement Address Delivered At Harvard University, June 8, 1978</b><br /><br />Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn<br /><br /><i>Solzhenitsyn's warning of Western decline is as relevant today as it was [thirty-five] years ago.</i><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="firstcap">I</span> am sincerely happy to be here with  you on the occasion of the 327th commencement of this old and  illustrious university. My congratulations and best wishes to all of  today's graduates.</div><br /><div style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); float: left; margin: 0px 2em 1em 0px; padding: 3px; text-align: justify;"><img alt="Alexander Solzhenitsyn at Harvard" src="http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/images/SolzhenitsynHarvardCommencement.jpg" title="Alexander Solzhenitsyn at Harvard" /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Harvard's motto is "VERITAS." Many of you have already found out and others will find out in the course of their lives that truth eludes us  as soon as our concentration begins to flag, all the while leaving the  illusion that we are continuing to pursue it. This is the source of much  discord. Also, truth seldom is sweet; it is almost invariably bitter. A  measure of truth is included in my speech today, but I offer it as a  friend, not as an adversary.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Three years ago in the United States I said certain things that were  rejected and appeared unacceptable. Today, however, many people agree  with what I said . . .</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The split in today's world is perceptible even to a hasty glance. Any  of our contemporaries readily identifies two world powers, each of them  already capable of destroying each other. However, the understanding of  the split too often is limited to this political conception: the  illusion according to which danger may be abolished through successful  diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces. The  truth is that the split is both more profound and more alienating, that  the rifts are more numerous than one can see at first glance. These deep  manifold splits bear the danger of equally manifold disaster for all of  us, in accordance with the ancient truth that a kingdom — in this case,  our Earth — divided against itself cannot stand.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">There is the concept of the Third World: thus, we already have three  worlds. Undoubtedly, however, the number is even greater; we are just  too far away to see. Every ancient and deeply rooted self-contained  culture, especially if it is spread over a wide part of the earth's  surface, constitutes a self-contained world, full of riddles and  surprises to Western thinking. As a minimum, we must include in this  China, India, the Muslim world, and Africa, if indeed we accept the  approximation of viewing the latter two as uniform. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">For one thousand years Russia belonged to such a category, although  Western thinking systematically committed the mistake of denying its  special character and therefore never understood it, just as today the  West does not understand Russia in Communist captivity. And while it may  be that in past years Japan has increasingly become, in effect, a Far  West, drawing ever closer to Western ways (I am no judge here), Israel, I  think, should not be reckoned as part of the West, if only because of  the decisive circumstance that its state system is fundamentally linked  to its religion.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">How short a time ago, relatively, the small world of modern Europe  was easily seizing colonies all over the globe, not only without  anticipating any real resistance, but usually with contempt for any  possible values in the conquered people's approach to life. It all  seemed an overwhelming success, with no geographic limits. Western  society expanded in a triumph of human independence and power. And all  of a sudden the twentieth century brought the clear realization of this  society's fragility. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">We now see that the conquests proved to be short lived and precarious  (and this, in turn, points to defects in the Western view of the world  which led to these conquests). Relations with the former colonial world  now have switched to the opposite extreme and the Western world often  exhibits an excess of obsequiousness, but it is difficult yet to  estimate the size of the bill which former colonial countries will  present to the West and it is difficult to predict whether the surrender  not only of its last colonies, but of everything it owns, will be  sufficient for the West to clear this account.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">But the persisting blindness of superiority continues to hold the  belief that all the vast regions of our planet should develop and mature  to the level of contemporary Western systems, the best in theory and  the most attractive in practice; that all those other worlds are but  temporarily prevented (by wicked leaders or by severe crises or by their  own barbarity and incomprehension) from pursuing Western pluralistic  democracy and adopting the Western way of life. Countries are judged on  the merit of their progress in that direction. But in fact such a  conception is a fruit of Western incomprehension of the essence of other  worlds, a result of mistakenly measuring them all with a Western  yardstick. The real picture of our planet's development bears little  resemblance to all this.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The anguish of a divided world gave birth to the theory of  convergence between the leading Western countries and the Soviet Union.  It is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are  not evolving toward each other and that neither one can be transformed  into the other without violence. Besides, convergence inevitably means  acceptance of the other side's defects, too. and this can hardly suit  anyone.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">If I were today addressing an audience in my country, in my  examination of the overall pattern of the world's rifts I would have  concentrated on the calamities of the East. But since my forced exile in  the West has now lasted four years and since my audience is a Western  one, I think it may be of greater interest to concentrate on certain  aspects of the contemporary West, such as I see them.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">A decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside  observer notices in the West today. The Western world has lost its  civic courage, both as a whole and separately, in each country, in each  government, in each political party, and, of course, in the United  Nations. Such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the  ruling and intellectual elites, causing an impression of a loss of  courage by the entire society. There are many courageous individuals,  but they have no determining influence on public life.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Political and intellectual functionaries exhibit this depression,  passivity, and perplexity in their actions and in their statements, and  even more so in their self-serving rationales as to how realistic,  reasonable, and intellectually and even morally justified it is to base  state policies on weakness and cowardice. And the decline in courage, at  times attaining what could be termed a lack of manhood, is ironically  emphasized by occasional outbursts and inflexibility on the part of  those same functionaries when dealing with weak governments and with  countries that lack support, or with doomed currents which clearly  cannot offer resistance. But they get tongue-tied and paralyzed when  they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces, with  aggressors and international terrorists.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Must one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the first symptom of the end?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">When the modern Western states were being formed, it was proclaimed  as a principle that governments are meant to serve man and that man  lives in order to be free and pursue happiness. (See, for example, the  American Declaration of Independence.) Now at last during past decades  technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such  aspirations: the welfare state. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods  in such quantity and in such quality as to guarantee in theory the  achievement of happiness, in the debased sense of the word which has  come into being during those same decades. (In the process, however, one  psychological detail has been overlooked: the constant desire to have  still more things and a still better life and the struggle to this end  imprint many Western faces with worry and even depression, though it is  customary to carefully conceal such feelings. This active and tense  competition comes to dominate all human thought and does not in the  least open a way to free spiritual development.)</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The individual's independence from many types of state pressure has  been guaranteed; the majority of the people have been granted well-being  to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about;  it has become possible to raise young people according to these ideals,  preparing them for and summoning them toward physical bloom, happiness,  and leisure, the possession of material goods, money, and leisure,  toward an almost unlimited freedom in the choice of pleasures. So who  should now renounce all this, why and for the sake of what should one  risk one's precious life in defense of the common good and particularly  in the nebulous case when the security of one's nation must be defended  in an as yet distant land?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Even biology tells us that a high degree of habitual well-being is  not advantageous to a living organism. Today, well-being in the life of  Western society has begun to take off its pernicious mask.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Western society has chosen for itself the organization best suited to  its purposes and one I might call legalistic. The limits of human  rights and rightness are determined by a system of laws; such limits are  very broad. People in the West have acquired considerable skill in  using, interpreting, and manipulating law (though laws tend to be too  complicated for an average person to understand without the help of an  expert). Every conflict is solved according to the letter of the law and  this is considered to be the ultimate solution.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">If one is risen from a legal point of view, nothing more is required,  nobody may mention that one could still not be right, and urge  self-restraint or a renunciation of these rights, call for sacrifice and  selfless risk: this would simply sound absurd. Voluntary self-restraint  is almost unheard of: everybody strives toward further expansion to the  extreme limit of the legal frames. (An oil company is legally blameless  when it buys up an invention of a new type of energy in order to  prevent its use. A food product manufacturer is legally blameless when  he poisons his produce to make it last longer: after all, people are  free not to purchase it.)</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I have spent all my life under a Communist regime and I will tell you  that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one  indeed. But a society based on the letter of the law and never reaching  any higher fails to take full advantage of the full range of human  possibilities. The letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a  beneficial influence on society. Whenever the tissue of life is woven of  legalistic relationships, this creates an atmosphere of spiritual  mediocrity that paralyzes man's noblest impulses.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">And it will be simply impossible to bear up to the trials of this  threatening century with nothing but the supports of a legalistic  structure.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Today's Western society has revealed the inequality between the  freedom for good deeds and the freedom for evil deeds. A statesman who  wants to achieve something highly constructive for his country has to  move cautiously and even timidly; thousands of hasty (and irresponsible)  critics cling to him at all times; he is constantly rebuffed by  parliament and the press. He has to prove that his every step is well  founded and absolutely flawless. Indeed, an outstanding, truly great  person who has unusual and unexpected initiatives in mind does not get  any chance to assert himself; dozens of traps will be set for him from  the beginning. Thus mediocrity triumphs under the guise of democratic  restraints.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It is feasible and easy everywhere to undermine administrative power  and it has in fact been drastically weakened in all Western countries.  The defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make  society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals. It is time,  in the West, to defend not so much human rights as human obligations.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, destructive and irresponsible freedom has been  granted boundless space. Society has turned out to have scarce defense  against the abyss of human decadence, for example against the misuse of  liberty for moral violence against young people, such as motion pictures  full of pornography, crime, and horror. This is all considered to be  part of freedom and to be counterbalanced, in theory, by the young  people's right not to look and not to accept. Life organized  legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the  corrosion of evil.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">And what shall we say about the dark realms of overt criminality?  Legal limits (especially in the United States) are broad enough to  encourage not only individual freedom but also some misuse of such  freedom. The culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency —  all with the support of thousands of defenders in the society. When a  government earnestly undertakes to root out terrorism, public opinion  immediately accuses it of violating the terrorist's civil rights. There  is quite a number of such cases.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">This tilt of freedom toward evil has come about gradually, but it  evidently stems from a humanistic and benevolent concept according to  which man — the master of the world — does not bear any evil within  himself, and all the defects of life are caused by misguided social  systems, which must therefore be corrected. Yet strangely enough, though  the best social conditions have been achieved in the West, there still  remains a great deal of crime; there even is considerably more of it  than in the destitute and lawless Soviet society. (There is a multitude  of prisoners in our camps who are termed criminals, but most of them  never committed any crime; they merely tried to defend themselves  against a lawless state by resorting to means outside the legal  framework.)</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The press, too, of course, enjoys the widest freedom. (I shall be  using the word "press" to include all the media.) But what use does it  make of it?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Here again, the overriding concern is not to infringe the letter of  the law. There is no true moral responsibility for distortion or  disproportion. What sort of responsibility does a journalist or a  newspaper have to the readership or to history? If they have misled  public opinion by inaccurate information or wrong conclusions, even if  they have contributed to mistakes on a state level, do we know of any  case of open regret voiced by the same journalist or the same newspaper?  No; this would damage sales. A nation may be the worse for such a  mistake, but the journalist always gets away with it. It is most likely  that he will start writing the exact opposite to his previous statements  with renewed aplomb.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Because instant and credible information is required, it becomes  necessary to resort to guesswork, rumors, and suppositions to fill in  the voids, and none of them will ever be refuted; they settle into the  readers' memory. How many hasty, immature, superficial, and misleading  judgments are expressed everyday, confusing readers, and then left  hanging? </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The press can act the role of public opinion or miseducate it. Thus  we may see terrorists heroized, or secret matters pertaining to the  nation's defense publicly revealed, or we may witness shameless  intrusion into the privacy of well-known people according to the slogan  "Everyone is entitled to know everything." (But this is a false slogan  of a false era; far greater in value is the forfeited right of people  not to know, not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip,  nonsense, vain talk. A person who works and leads a meaningful life has  no need for this excessive and burdening flow of information.)</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Hastiness and superficiality — these are the psychic diseases of the  twentieth century and more than anywhere else this is manifested in the  press. In-depth analysis of a problem is anathema to the press; it is  contrary to its nature. The press merely picks out sensational formulas.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Such as it is, however, the press has become the greatest power  within Western countries, exceeding that of the legislature, the  executive, and the judiciary. Yet one would like to ask: According to  what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible? In the  Communist East, a journalist is frankly appointed as a state official.  But who has voted Western journalists into their positions of power, for  how long a time, and with what prerogatives?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">There is yet another surprise for someone coming from the  totalitarian East with its rigorously unified press: One discovers a  common trend of preferences within the Western press as a whole (the  spirit of the time), generally accepted patterns of judgment, and maybe  common corporate interests, the sum effect being not competition but  unification. Unrestrained freedom exists for the press, but not for  readership, because newspapers mostly transmit in a forceful and  emphatic way those opinions which do not too openly contradict their own  and that general trend.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Without any censorship in the West, fashionable trends of thought and  ideas are fastidiously separated from those that are not fashionable,  and the latter, without ever being forbidden have little chance of  finding their way into periodicals or books or being heard in colleges.  Your scholars are free in the legal sense, but they are hemmed in by the  idols of the prevailing fad. There is no open violence, as in the East;  however, a selection dictated by fashion and the need to accommodate  mass standards frequently prevents the most independent-minded persons  from contributing to public life and gives rise to dangerous herd  instincts that block dangerous herd development.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In America, I have received letters from highly intelligent persons —  maybe a teacher in a faraway small college who could do much for the  renewal and salvation of his country, but the country cannot hear him  because the media will not provide him with a forum. This gives birth to  strong mass prejudices, to a blindness which is perilous in our dynamic  era. An example is the self-deluding interpretation of the state of  affairs in the contemporary world that functions as a sort of petrified  armor around people's minds, to such a degree that human voices from  seventeen countries of Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia cannot pierce it.  It will be broken only by the inexorable crowbar of events.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I have mentioned a few traits of Western life which surprise and  shock a new arrival to this world . The purpose and scope of this speech  will not allow me to continue such a survey, in particular to look into  the impact of these characteristics on important aspects of a nation's  life, such as elementary education, advanced education in the  humanities, and art.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It is almost universally recognized that the West shows all the world  the way to successful economic development, even though in past years  it has been sharply offset by chaotic inflation. However, many people  living in the West are dissatisfied with their own society. They despise  it or accuse it of no longer being up to the level of maturity by  mankind. And this causes many to sway toward socialism, which is a false  and dangerous current.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I hope that no one present will suspect me of expressing my partial  criticism of the Western system in order to suggest socialism as an  alternative. No; with the experience of a country where socialism has  been realized, I shall not speak for such an alternative. The  mathematician Igor Shafarevich, a member of the Soviet Academy of  Science, has written a brilliantly argued book entitled Socialism; this  is a penetrating historical analysis demonstrating that socialism of any  type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a  leveling of mankind into death. Shafarevich's book was published in  France almost two years ago and so far no one has been found to refute  it. It will shortly be published in English in the U.S.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">But should I be asked, instead, whether I would propose the West,  such as it is today, as a model to my country, I would frankly have to  answer negatively. No, I could not recommend your society as an ideal  for the transformation of ours. Through deep suffering, people in our  own country have now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity  that the Western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion  does not look attractive. Even those characteristics of your life which I  have just enumerated are extremely saddening.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">A fact which cannot be disputed is the weakening of human personality  in the West while in the East it has become firmer and stronger. Six  decades for our people and three decades for the people of Eastern  Europe; during that time we have been through a spiritual training far  in advance of Western experience. The complex and deadly crush of life  has produced stronger, deeper, and more interesting personalities than  those generated by standardized Western well-being. Therefore, if our  society were to be transformed into yours, it would mean an improvement  in certain aspects, but also a change for the worse on some particularly  significant points.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, a society cannot remain in an abyss of lawlessness, as is  the case in our country. But it is also demeaning for it to stay on such  a soulless and smooth plane of legalism, as is the case in yours. After  the suffering of decades of violence and oppression, the human soul  longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's  mass living habits, introduced as by a calling card by the revolting  invasion of commercial advertising, by TV stupor, and by intolerable  music.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">All this is visible to numerous observers from all the worlds of our  planet. The Western way of life is less and less likely to become the  leading model.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">There are telltale symptoms by which history gives warning to a  threatened or perishing society. Such are, for instance, a decline of  the arts or a lack of great statesmen. Indeed, sometimes the warnings  are quite explicit and concrete. The center of your democracy and of  your culture is left without electric power for a few hours only, and  all of a sudden crowds of American citizens start looting and creating  havoc. The smooth surface film must be very thin, then, the social  system quite unstable and unhealthy.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">But the fight for our planet, physical and spiritual, a fight of  cosmic proportions, is not a vague matter of the future; it has already  started. The forces of Evil have begun their decisive offensive. You can  feel their pressure, yet your screens and publications are full of  prescribed smiles and raised glasses. What is the joy about?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">How has this unfavorable relation of forces come about? How did the  West decline from its triumphal march to its present debility? Have  there been fatal turns and losses of direction in its development? It  does not seem so. The West kept advancing steadily in accordance with  its proclaimed social intentions, hand in hand with a dazzling progress  in technology. And all of a sudden it found itself in its present state  of weakness.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">This means that the mistake must be at the root, at the very  foundation of thought in modern times. I refer to the prevailing Western  view of the world in modern times. I refer to the prevailing Western  view of the world which was born in the Renaissance and has found  political expression since the Age of Enlightenment. It became the basis  for political and social doctrine and could be called rationalistic  humanism or humanistic autonomy: the pro-claimed and practiced autonomy  of man from any higher force above him. It could also be called  anthropocentricity, with man seen as the center of all.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The turn introduced by the Renaissance was probably inevitable  historically: the Middle Ages had come to a natural end by exhaustion,  having become an intolerable despotic repression of man's physical  nature in favor of the spiritual one. But then we recoiled from the  spirit and embraced all that is material, excessively and  incommensurately. The humanistic way of thinking, which had proclaimed  itself our guide, did not admit the existence of intrinsic evil in man,  nor did it see any task higher than the attainment of happiness on  earth. It started modern Western civilization on the dangerous trend of  worshiping man and his material needs.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Everything beyond physical well-being and the accumulation of  material goods, all other human requirements and characteristics of a  subtle and higher nature, were left outside the area of attention of  state and social systems, as if human life did not have any higher  meaning. Thus gaps were left open for evil, and its drafts blow freely  today. Mere freedom per se does not in the least solve all the problems  of human life and even adds a number of new ones.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">And yet in early democracies, as in American democracy at the time of  its birth, all individual human rights were granted on the ground that  man is God's creature. That is, freedom was given to the individual  conditionally, in the assumption of his constant religious  responsibility. Such was the heritage of the preceding one thousand  years. Two hundred or even fifty years ago, it would have seemed quite  impossible, in America, that an individual be granted boundless freedom  with no purpose, simply for the satisfaction of his whims.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, however, all such limitations were eroded everywhere in  the West; a total emancipation occurred from the moral heritage of  Christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice.  State systems were becoming ever more materialistic. The West has  finally achieved the rights of man, and even excess, but man's sense of  responsibility to God and society has grown dimmer and dimmer. In the  past decades, the legalistic selfishness of the Western approach to the  world has reached its peak and the world has found itself in a harsh  spiritual crisis and a political impasse. All the celebrated  technological achievements of progress, including the conquest of outer  space, do not redeem the twentieth century's moral poverty, which no one  could have imagined even as late as the nineteenth century.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">As humanism in its development was becoming more and more  materialistic, it also increasingly allowed concepts to be used first by  socialism and then by communism, so that Karl Marx was able to say, in  1844, that "communism is naturalized humanism."</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">This statement has proved to be not entirely unreasonable. One does  not see the same stones in the foundations of an eroded humanism and of  any type of socialism: boundless materialism; freedom from religion and  religious responsibility (which under Communist regimes attains the  stage of antireligious dictatorship); concentration on social structures  with an allegedly scientific approach. (This last is typical of both  the Age of Enlightenment and of Marxism.) It is no accident that all of  communism's rhetorical vows revolve around Man (with a capital M) and  his earthly happiness. At first glance it seems an ugly parallel: common  traits in the thinking and way of life of today's West and today's  East? But such is the logic of materialistic development.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The interrelationship is such, moreover, that the current of  materialism which is farthest to the left, and is hence the most  consistent, always proves to be stronger, more attractive, and  victorious. Humanism which has lost its Christian heritage cannot  prevail in this competition. Thus during the past centuries and  especially in recent decades, as the process became more acute, the  alignment of forces was as follows: Liberalism was inevitably pushed  aside by radicalism, radicalism had to surrender to socialism, and  socialism could not stand up to communism. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The communist regime in the East could endure and grow due to the  enthusiastic support from an enormous number of Western intellectuals  who (feeling the kinship!) refused to see communism's crimes, and when  they no longer could do so, they tried to justify these crimes. The  problem persists: In our Eastern countries, communism has suffered a  complete ideological defeat; it is zero and less than zero. And yet  Western intellectuals still look at it with considerable interest and  empathy, and this is precisely what makes it so immensely difficult for  the West to withstand the East.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I am not examining the case of a disaster brought on by a world war  and the changes which it would produce in society. But as long as we  wake up every morning under a peaceful sun, we must lead an everyday  life. Yet there is a disaster which is already very much with us. I am  referring to the calamity of an autonomous, irreligious humanistic  consciousness.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It has made man the measure of all things on earth — imperfect man,  who is never free of pride, self-interest, envy, vanity, and dozens of  other defects. We are now paying for the mistakes which were not  properly appraised at the beginning of the journey. On the way from the  Renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience, but we have  lost the concept of a Supreme Complete Entity which used to restrain our  passions and our irresponsibility. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">We have placed too much hope in politics and social reforms, only to  find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession:  our spiritual life. It is trampled by the party mob in the East, by the  commercial one in the West. This is the essence of the crisis: the split  in the world is less terrifying than the similarity of the disease  afflicting its main sections.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">If, as claimed by humanism, man were born only to be happy, he would  not be born to die. Since his body is doomed to death, his task on earth  evidently must be more spiritual: not a total engrossment in everyday  life, not the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then  their carefree consumption. It has to be the fulfillment of a  permanent, earnest duty so that one's life journey may become above all  an experience of moral growth: to leave life a better human being than  one started it. </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">It is imperative to reappraise the scale of the usual human values;  its present incorrectness is astounding. It is not possible that  assessment of the President's performance should be reduced to the  question of how much money one makes or to the availability of gasoline.  Only by the voluntary nurturing in ourselves of freely accepted and  serene self-restraint can mankind rise above the world stream of  materialism.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Today it would be retrogressive to hold on to the ossified formulas  of the Enlightenment. Such social dogmatism leaves us helpless before  the trials of our times.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Even if we are spared destruction by war, life will have to change in  order not to perish on its own. We cannot avoid reassessing the  fundamental definitions of human life and society. Is it true that man  is above everything? Is there no Superior Spirit above him? Is it right  that man's life and society's activities should be ruled by material  expansion above all? Is it permissible to promote such expansion to the  detriment of our integral spiritual life?</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">If the world has not approached its end, it has reached a major  watershed in history, equal in importance to the turn from the Middle  Ages to the Renaissance. It will demand from us a spiritual blaze; we  shall have to rise to a new height of vision, to a new level of life,  where our physical nature will not be cursed, as in the Middle Ages, but  even more importantly, our spiritual being will not be trampled upon,  as in the Modern Era.</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The ascension is similar to climbing onto the next anthropological stage. No one on earth has any other way left but — upward.</div>

This is an excellent book for those wishing to broaden their scope beyond the ????? Greek of the New Testament and enter into the Greek of the early Church. Whitacre is very helpful, but he is not <i>too</i> helpful, as one doing this level of translation needs to work toward independence. His text seems to be in that direction.<br /><br />My post today concerns fasting. What should one do if engaged in a voluntary fast and one ends up at a dinner party or with an unexpected guest? Stay the course or entertain with a five-course? Of course, with respect to canon law, Christians are obliged to follow the norms. So, for example, if it is a required day of abstinence, one is religiously required to avoid eating meat. But what about the weekly Christian living, fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays as prescribed in the <i>Didache of the Twelve Apostles</i>?<br /><br />I had a memorable experience when I was a student. One day, I was fasting on bread and water. I had been sharing my class notes with an international student, who chose to express his gratitude that evening by bringing to class some juice for me. It was very thoughtful, and so I set the fast aside to enjoy it in his presence out of gratitude for the act of charity. But I questioned myself, 'Should I have persisted in my fast? should I have saved the drink for later? or did I do the right thing?' Perhaps you have found yourself in the same situation. I think this is common in the Christian experience—one sets out to fast, and some kind person in true charity and not knowing of the secret fast randomly gives sustenance through the prompting of the Holy Spirit. This is clearly the testing of God. I think the lesson is to help us be "detached" from the fast.<br /><br />In the sayings of the desert fathers, some of which are related in Whitacre’s reader, I found a helpful story related by Abba Cassian. Here is my translation of the original Greek.<br /><br /><br /><dir>Abba Cassian related, “Holy Germanus and I visited with an old man (<b>???? ???????</b>) in Egypt and he entertained us hospitably (<b>???????????</b>) and was questioned by us, “Why in the reception of foreign brothers do you not keep the canon of fasting we received in Palestine?” And he answered saying, “The fast is always with me. But I cannot always hold you with me. The fasting is a useful and even necessary thing, but it is our choice. But the law of God demands the love of neighbor from necessity. Receiving Christ in you, therefore, I need to serve with all haste. If I should send you forth, I can recover the canon of fasting. For the sons of the bridegroom cannot fast as long as the bridegroom is with them. But when the bridegroom is taken away, then they will fast with authority.”</dir><br /><br />Fasting is an important choice—the <b>?????</b> (old man) says useful and necessary. But love of neighbor is beyond choice; it is a commandment. In other words, love of neighbor must always come before our fasting. Hospitality (from <b>?????????</b>, i.e., to love strangers) is recognizing the presence of Christ the bridegroom in a brother. By the grace of God, I did the right thing at that time. Drink the juice, the desert fathers seem to say; resume the fast at another time.<br /><br /><iframe src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=thechafir-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=080104801X" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

		<document id="5609d106b37cd86ccb7f7896f54dc1d9" url="http://kevinmclarke.blogspot.com/2013/07/initial-observations-lumen-fidei.html"><![CDATA[Well, I know it's been a while since I've written anything, so I apologize if I have kept anyone hanging. I have been quite busy with a great many "professional development" things, such as sharpening languages, preparation for teaching, and paying important visits.<br /><br />But what a momentous day, no? A new encyclical and two new papal saints! Soon--i.e., sometime in 2013--we will say "Pope St. John XXIII" and "Pope St. John Paul II" (and many of us will add, "the Great"). Wow!<br /><br />And now, we have this glorious encyclical, which I jealously add that my Eastern Time friends have had a 3+ hours start on my reading. I say "+" because of a trip to the mechanic.<br /><br />My initial thoughts are that this encyclical is quite obviously Ratzingerian. First of all, Pope Francis says as much (cf. <i>LF</i>, 7). Secondly, the encyclical picks up right away with the "I-thou"/"we-thou" language that is so characteristic of much of Benedict's writing and ecclesial theology (cf. <i>LF</i>, 8, 39, and 43). Thirdly, the structure seems to conform to how Pope Benedict typically structured his encyclicals on hope and charity (his social encyclical follows a slightly different structure): introduction, encyclical topic seen through the lens of salvation history, a thoroughgoing theological exposition, a relation to contemporary crises or questions, finishing with a catechesis on the Blessed Virgin's relation to the topic of the encyclical and a dedicatory prayer of entrustment to her patronage. That's a bit of an overly simplistic outline, so I beg pardon for that. Having read much of what Pope Benedict wrote about Our Lady (see my paper in <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761848479/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0761848479&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thechafir-20">De Maria Numquam Satis</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thechafir-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0761848479" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /></i>), I am convinced that all or nearly all of <i>LF</i> 58-60 came from his own hand.<br /><br />The continuity between the two pontificates is manifest beautifully in the very promulgation of this encyclical. Will it be predominately Ratzingerian? I don't know yet, but I am looking forward to reading the rest of it for this blessed Year of Faith!<br /><br />Happy reading to you as well! Link: <i><a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20130629_enciclica-lumen-fidei_en.pdf" target="_blank">Lumen Fidei</a></i><br /><br />___<br /><br /><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Update, roughly 3 p.m. PDT</b></span>: 25 paragraphs in, and I am utterly captivated by this encyclical. This seems to be the last word of the Benedict XVI pontificate to the Church, as the overtones from his writing style and theological emphases are present throughout, from the introduction of the encyclical and onward. ...<br /><br /><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Update, roughly 3:30 p.m. PDT</b></span>: Pausing to illuminate my favorite <i>Lumen Fidei</i> quotes: <br /><br />"... Faith understands that something so apparently ephemeral and fleeting as a word, when spoken by the God who is fidelity, becomes absolutely certain and unshakable, guaranteeing the continuity of our journey through history. Faith accepts this word as a solid rock upon which we can build, a straight highway on which we can travel ..." (LF, 10).<br /><br />"... If love is not tied to truth, it falls prey to fickle emotions and cannot stand the test of time. True love, on the other hand, unifies all the elements of our person and becomes a new light pointing the way to a great and fulfilled life. Without truth, love is incapable of establishing a firm bond; it cannot liberate our isolated ego or redeem it from the fleeting moment in order to create life and bear fruit" (LF, 27).<br /><br />"... One who believes may not be presumptuous; on the contrary, truth leads to humility, since believers know that, rather than ourselves possessing truth, it is truth which embraces and possesses us ..." (LF, 34).<br /><br />"... Faith is necessarily ecclesial; it is professed from within the body of Christ as a concrete communion of believers. It is against this ecclesial backdrop that faith opens the individual Christian towards all others ..." (LF, 22).<br /><br />"How does one attain this synthesis between hearing and seeing? It becomes possible through the person of Christ himself, who can be seen and heard. He is the Word made flesh, whose glory we have seen (cf. Jn 1:14). The light of faith is the light of a countenance in which the Father is seen ..." (LF, 30).<br /><br />"There is an urgent need, then, to see once again that faith is a light, for once the flame of faith dies out, all other lights begin to dim. The light of faith is unique, since it is capable of illuminating every aspect of human existence... (LF, 4).<br /><br />"... Clearly, theology is impossible without faith ..." (LF, 36). Preach!<br /><br /><span style="color: #990000;"><b>Update, roughly 4:15 p.m. PDT</b></span>: Finished! Now going to let it soak in a bit. I do hope you read it. It reads very much like a whole for a document composed "with four hands," as Francis has said. Very accessible.

This proved very beneficial and helped give some clarity regarding what I am trying to accomplish here, namely an encounter with Jesus Christ. What is the faith and the practice of the faith? What do we believe about God? about Jesus Christ?<br /><br />As my own personal studies have turned more toward the history of Christianity as seen in the Church Fathers and toward systematic theology, I am going to be posting more in that direction. Less me, more them. In this way, I hope to share some of the things I am studying as well as present refreshingly new ancient words to my readers. I have been going this direction for a while on this blog, but making this explicitly stated should help. Considering those who I know read this blog, I think this better  engages their interests than do my rantings against the HHS mandate, or  against Planned Parenthood, and so on. The mystery of sin and evil is fought more effectively through prayer and fasting than through a great many words.<br /><br />Also, I have found that I must do battle with this unholy desire--which I understand needs to be mortified--to comment upon every news happening in the Church and in politics. Of course, I do not. This dynamic leads to vainglory if I do write something and the temptation to critical thoughts if I do not, which is itself vainglorious (as though my input were necessary for some reason). As a result, I end up feeding the vice of curiosity by reading way too many news stories and commentary. Now, it is one's civic duty to call attention to injustice in the world, and so I will continue to do so in various ways, but for this blog, I really must stick to my strengths and entrust you to my blogroll for others' commentary on those matters.<br /><br />For the sake of balance and order, therefore, I'll pass along helpful articles I may find on political matters through Twitter, but I will stick to strictly theological purposes for <i>The Charcoal Fire</i>.<br /><br />So what sorts of topics will I be writing about on this blog in the future? Those such as: <br /><ul><li>Our Lady </li><li>St. Ignatius of Antioch's theology of the episcopacy</li><li>St. Thomas Aquinas's teachings on faith</li><li>St. Maximus the Confessor's theology of the two wills of Christ</li><li>eschatology </li><li>asceticism</li><li>martyrdom</li><li>Scriptural exegesis of the Fathers</li><li>reactions to theological works I am reading </li><li>and like topics</li></ul>In all things, the goal is a greater encounter with Jesus Christ. Less me, more Him.

Here is the intro to the story...<br /><br /><br /><br /><dir><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-ct-onlocation-red-line20130814,0,5164551.story" target="_blank">Class project yields a feature film with commercial distributors</a><br />by Richard Verrier | LA Times<br />The prospects of finding a distributor for a $220,000 movie, produced mainly by college students at an obscure San Diego Catholic university, could hardly be worse.<br /><br />But about 60 students at John Paul the Great Catholic University who embarked on a quixotic class project two summers ago to make and release their own movie beat the odds.<br /><br />With the help of faculty members who had ties in Hollywood, the students recruited professional actors and crew members to help make their film. Students wrote the script — about a terrorist attack that takes place on a Red Line subway in Los Angeles — raised funds and worked behind the camera, finding props and costumes and building sets.<br /><br />And they accomplished something many independent filmmakers would envy: They managed to secure deals to distribute the movie through iTunes, Amazon.com and Redbox last month. Starting in October, DVDs will be sold through Wal-Mart and Target.<br /><br />Student film shoots are a common sight in Los Angeles — which has a plethora of local film schools — and occasionally generate more production days than feature films. But most are for film shorts, not full-length feature films, and rarely do those movies find commercial distributors.<br /><br />"Most industry professionals said it couldn't be done and that we had no hope of making it look like a professionally produced feature or attracting a stellar cast," said Dominic Iocco, former dean of the film and media department and a producer on the film. "But we did it and we couldn't be more proud."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-fi-ct-onlocation-red-line20130814,0,5164551.story" target="_blank">Read the rest here...</a></dir><br /><br />Just so we're clear, I'm not one of the faculty member with the Hollywood connections!

I remembered the story of the apparition above the Coptic church near Cairo. It is time again to invoke Our Lady of Zeitoun for peace in Egypt. She appeared there first on April 2, 1968--45 years ago. No doubt it is still in the national memory there. When she appeared, she said nothing, but she came with signs and miracles for Christians and non-Christians alike. I would encourage anyone who wishes there be an end to the violence to turn to Our Lady's supplication.<br /><br /><iframe width="500" height="375" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nMEWxRB-1dc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Her appearance in 1968 seems to be an invitation to enter deeply into prayer for this land torn by violence, a land in which the Holy Family sought refuge from the murderous Herod. Our Lady is the Help of Christians, as we invoke her in the Litany of Loreto. No evil is greater than she who conceived the Author of Life and Prince of Peace in the stillness of her virginal womb. By her "yes," she made the Co-Equal, Co-Eternal Son of God our brother, conquering the pride of the serpent by her perfect humility and immortal meekness.<br /><br />For the Christians in Egypt, let us pray!

While miss the reading cycle for the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows since today is a Sunday, the month of September is nonetheless dedicated to the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady, uniquely meritorious because of her divine motherhood and immaculate conception in and through the merits of Christ himself. The "Seven Sorrows" are:<br /><br /><dir><ol><li>the prophecy of Simeon</li><li>the flight into Egypt </li><li>the loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple</li><li>the meeting of Mother and Son on the way to Calvary</li><li>the death of Christ</li><li>the removal of Christ from the Cross (see <i>Pietá</i>)</li><li>the entombment of Christ</li></ol></dir><br /><br />In honor of Our Lady’s sufferings, I share the following excerpt from my article on Pope Benedict's Mariology in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761848479/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0761848479&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thechafir-20"><i>De Maria Numquam Satis</i></a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=thechafir-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0761848479" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> (pp. 168-169). (Most of my article is capable of being previewed via the "look inside" on Amazon, so if you want to read more, you can there.)<br /><br /><h3><span style="color: #660000;">Excerpted from “Divinely Given 'Into Our Reality': Mary’s Maternal Mediation according to Pope Benedict XVI” in <i>De Maria Numquam Satis</i> (UPA, 2009)</span></h3><b>“Into Our Reality” – Mary and Her Spiritual Maternity over All Humanity</b><br /><br />Not only does Our Lady cooperate in redemption, but that cooperation has a direct result for her – spiritual maternity.<br /><br />At the Cross, through the all-powerful words of her Son, this title “woman” undergoes a transformation. As the divine Logos of God accomplishes what is said, so when he says, “behold your mother,” she takes on a new role, because God the Son declared it: “My word … shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose…” (Is 55:11). Had this been the scene of the crucifixion of “any-man,” it would appear that this dying criminal is setting his affairs in order before he passes. However, this man is also true God, the divine Logos, who “rules from the Cross” (1) – and this is a decree for the kingdom. His beloved disciple is now “everyman.” <br /><dir>From that moment, you became, in a new way, <br />the Mother of all those who receive your Son Jesus in faith <br />and choose to follow in his footsteps by taking up his Cross. … (2)</dir><br />It is because she is on Calvary pierced by the sword of sorrow that she is the Mother of all who follow her Son. The catechesis contained in the prayer to Our Lady of Sheshan beautifully expresses the Pope’s teachings of the spiritual maternity of Mary over all humanity, which has its power in the Word of God.<br /><dir>Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home (Jn 19:25-27).</dir><br />Those italicized words are what I want to focus on, as they are the words the Pope points us toward. This passage appears as if Jesus is setting his affairs in order before his death, making sure that someone will look after his mother. But the original Greek conveys something more.<br /><dir>From the Cross, Jesus entrusted his Mother to all his disciples and at the same time entrusted all his disciples to the love of his Mother. The Evangelist John concludes the brief and evocative account with these words: “Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!’ And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home” (Jn19:27). This is the [English] translation of the Greek text “??? ?? ????,” he welcomed her into his own reality, his own existence. Thus, she is part of his life and the two lives penetrate each other. And this acceptance of her (??? ?? ????) in his own life is the Lord’s testament. Therefore, at the supreme moment of the fulfillment of his messianic mission, Jesus bequeaths as a precious inheritance to each one of his disciples his own Mother, the Virgin Mary (3).</dir><br />Finally, in this glimpse, it is worth highlighting one more significant word: “hour.” In the Gospel of John, as was mentioned above, the hour is frequently used in reference to the hour of the Passion. In the other episode in John’s Gospel in which Mary appears, the Wedding at Cana. “O woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come” (Jn 2:4). In Cana, we see Mary inquiring about something specific to Jesus’ hour of his Passion. And in the hour, we see him giving her as Mother to the disciple as an “action” of the hour. “From that hour, the disciple received her into his own” (Jn 19:27). Giving his mother is the Savior’s will during his saving Passion. Mary is a gift from her Son to every believer, a gift from the Cross.<br /><br />Pope Benedict stated in a homily on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven: “We have a mother in heaven. And the Mother of God, the Mother of the Son of God, is our Mother. He himself has said so. He made her our own Mother when he said to the disciple and to all of us: ‘Behold, your mother!’” Because Christ proclaims this from the Cross, and because his words are “living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword” (cf. Heb 4:12), this maternity of Mary over all believers is part of the “Good News” of Calvary, a truly personal gift from the Cross that abides in heaven to this day. “We have a Mother in Heaven. Heaven is open. Heaven has a heart” (4). <br /><br /><b>Notes</b><br /><b><br /></b> <span style="font-size: x-small;">(1) <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>, p. 338. Jesus “rules from the Cross, and does so in an entirely new way. Universality is achieved through the humility of communion in faith; this king rules by faith and love, and in no other way.” This is the King of the Jews—written in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew (Jn 19:20). And this is the place where Jesus has drawn all men to himself (Jn 12:32). By implication, this is significant for Mariology: Jesus’ gift of his Mother from the Cross to an Apostle, a prince of the Church to whom a kingdom has been assigned (cf. Lk 22:29), is a regal gift for all men whom he has drawn to himself and constitutes the place of Mary in the Church and vice versa.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">(2) Prayer to Our Lady of Sheshan.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">(3) General Audience, January 2, 2008. Cf. Homily on the anniversary of the death of Pope John Paul II, April 3, 2006. De la Potterie follows Charles Journet’s translation of this Greek phrase to “into his intimacy.” De la Potterie also points to the parallel of ??? ?? ???? between John’s prologue (1:11) and the scene on Calvary to argue that in neither case is the Scripture to be read in a merely materialistic way.</span><br /><dir><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is true that <i>eis ta idia</i> can mean at one’s house, at one’s home, in one’s country, etc.; but in this case, the expression is always used with a verb describing transfer or movement in a physical sense. One goes on a trip. Then, after a long absence, one returns to one’s home, or one’s house. Or someone sends someone else back home. There are many examples of this in the New Testament; for instance, in Acts 21:6: “… we boarded the ship. These people returned then to their homes.” But in the scene at the cross, <i>elaben</i> does not describe a physical transfer or movement. As we have said, this verb signals the beginning of an attitude of faith; it is a question of a “movement,” if you will, but then it is a purely spiritual movement, a first stage on the journey of faith. Of course, a physical transfer could readily go along with a journey of faith; but such a movement is totally out of perspective as to the verse and to the whole pericope, both of which find themselves on a strictly theological plane. Yet, if it is a question of spiritual attitude, there is still the <i>eis ta idia</i>. What, then, is the meaning of these three words? It most certainly is not a question of a house, but what belongs, “en propre” (peculiarly/to one’s own), to the disciple. This is what St. John’s repeated use of the term <i>idios</i> seems to suggest (e.g., Jn 10:4) … (Mary in the Mystery of the Covenant, pp. 227-228).</span></dir><span style="font-size: x-small;">(4) Homily, Aug. 15, 2005.</span><br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=thechafir-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=0761848479" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></iframe><br />
