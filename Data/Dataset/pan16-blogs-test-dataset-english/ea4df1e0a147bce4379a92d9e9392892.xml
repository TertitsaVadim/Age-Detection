Normally, when some Intellectual Property (IP) is developed as a part of research at a [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=582&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

So I was trying to get my own little start-up idea going, but, as I&#8217;d already blogged about, I was rapidly running out [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=599&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

We&#8217;re hiring lots and lots of people, both technical (developers) and non-technical. Something in particular about this interests me &#8211; Munich isn&#8217;t Germany&#8217;s first city, it isn&#8217;t even its second &#8211; in fact Munich is [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=615&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Naughty blogger. The reason for my silence has been a kind of self-imposed personal stealth mode, as I worked on a few things. Not that I expect the blogosphere has particularly suffered from my absence&#8230; nevertheless I would like to get back to blogging my thoughts.

Wondering why she was trying to access a dating website, when she&#8217;s meant to be dating me, I took a look at the website, FounderDating. The concept sounds good [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=636&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

When you&#8217;re always travelling at rocket-speed, it&#8217;s quite difficult to jump off a moving vehicle, but jump I have. In total I was at Rocket Internet for about 21 months, but given the amount I learnt [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=667&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

However, I think I underestimated just how tough it really is in practice until I began to try and find someone myself. Ever since I was a Seedcamp finalist, the main feedback I’ve had for my startup, Satago, when I’ve [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=672&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Something that was frequently mentioned was an issue that I have also been wrestling with: whether or not to stick with the original language that Satago was built with. Satago was built with [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=683&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Indeed,when I was working for Rocket Internet, one of my tasks was to re-design the invite-a-friend system for Westwing.de. More on that later&#8230; If you&#8217;re really clever/lucky you create such a shareable system, that you end up with a viral coefficient of over 1.0 (meaning [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=687&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Well, I successfully found a great co-founder and then got Satago accepted to Seedcamp.  If you want to know how I found my co-founder, I&#8217;ve just published a guest post on the Seedcamp blog. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wannabevc.wordpress.com&#038;blog=14070012&#038;post=715&#038;subd=wannabevc&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
