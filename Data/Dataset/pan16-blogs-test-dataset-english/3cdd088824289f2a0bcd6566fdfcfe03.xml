<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id575647534?mt=8"><strong>Fantastical</strong></a>: A beautiful and fast calendar for your iPhone. The Day Ticker focuses on the events that you have scheduled, rather than just looking at the week. You can even switch it to the month view so that it is an iPhone replica of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical/id435003921?mt=12">Mac app</a>, which I also use on a daily basis. The best part of Fantastical is the natural language input, so you can just put in something like &ldquo;Have lunch with Bob tomorrow at noon,&rdquo; which the app will then sort out into traditional calendar event input. Creating events has never been easier. Fantastical has earned a spot on my home screen, and for good reason. If you want to learn more about Fantastical, make sure to <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/11/quickadvice-fantastical">check out my full in-depth review on AppAdvice</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kitcam/id573928024?mt=8"><strong>KitCam</strong></a>: GhostBird Software has done it again. KitCam is a beautiful camera replacement app that allows you to capture both images <em>and</em> video. You can also apply various lenses, films, and frames on your image, and get live previews of them before you shoot. Think of Hipstamatic, but done much better. You can even fully edit your photos in KitCam as well, making it the ultimate photo and video solution for your iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timer-keep-time-on-anything!/id507518845?mt=8"><strong>Timer</strong></a>: A beautifully simple app that provides quick access to timers. Launch the app, find the timer you want, and press it to activate it. You can edit pre-existing timers as well as create your own new ones. It&rsquo;s beautiful, fast, and simple. There are also new themes, glyphs for labeling your timers, and sounds available through in-app purchases. If you appreciate simplicity and beauty in a practical app, then you will love Timer.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lovely-find-homes-apartments/id576063727?mt=8"><strong>Lovely</strong></a>: Finding apartments is hard, but ugly interfaces makes it even harder. Fortunately, Lovely provides a beautiful interface for finding your next home. Create an account, and you are able to favorite listings and set up alerts for when new listings pop up. You can pan the map around to find available listings, and view full details of the apartment and even contact the landlords about them.

This will be a collection of the best apps that I&rsquo;ve discovered or have been using in the past several weeks. Enjoy!</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-for-ipad/id542797283?mt=8"><strong>Drafts for iPad</strong></a>: Drafts is the best app for quickly jotting down text the moment it happens. I have been a user of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">iPhone version</a> since it came out, and it&rsquo;s become one of my favorite apps. The iPad version takes advantage of the larger screen estate and even includes a new keyboard extension that makes it easy to navigate between characters and insert common punctuation marks, including those for Markdown syntax. All of your settings and actions are kept intact between iPhone and iPad thanks to Simperium Sync as well, which works flawlessly. If you write on the iPad at all, make sure to get Drafts for iPad — you won&rsquo;t regret it. And grab the iPhone version if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pronto/id534514324?mt=8"><strong>Pronto</strong></a>: This gorgeous and simple app makes it easy to plan upcoming events. Keep items organized in categories, and then create event lists and add to-dos that need to be completed for the event in question. You can even have due dates and times, and create monthly or annually recurring items.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mixel-for-iphone/id549650476?mt=8"><strong>Mixel</strong></a>: Previously thought to be dead, Mixel came back on your iPhone. This app allows you to combine multiple photos into one alluring collage to share with the world. There are six different styles to choose from, each with their own unique layout and filtered look on photos. It&rsquo;s collages made easy.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weathercube-revolutionary/id555306679?mt=8"><strong>Weathercube</strong></a>: This is a unique take on weather. It&rsquo;s Clear-like interface is pretty intuitive since it relies on swipes and pinching gestures. You can get a six-day, daily, and hourly forecast, and even share your weather with friends on Facebook or Twitter. Pick a color theme that suits your style and listen to the whimsical sound effects that the app will emit when you play around with it. It&rsquo;s a great UI experiment for weather apps, but can still use a bit of tinkering (current temperature is shown in the Hourly view, not Daily, which is default). It&rsquo;s a great concept, though.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bastion/id537773100?mt=8"><strong>Bastion</strong></a>: This is my first time playing this fantastic action RPG, and it&rsquo;s going to be one of the best games you can buy on iOS this year. The gorgeous visuals, amazing soundtrack, captivating story, and excellent reactive narration make for one incredible action RPG that should not be missed. Make sure to grab it today if you want an in-depth gaming experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-ends-you-solo-remix/id544695089?mt=8"><strong>The World Ends With You: Solo Remix</strong></a>: Square Enix has released one of their best games as a port to the iPhone and iPad. Relive the story of Neku and The Reaper&rsquo;s Game in this unique action RPG that is not like anything you&rsquo;ve ever played before. Get stunning Retina visuals, stylish hip-hop soundtrack, and a distinctive combat system in this game. The only negative thing about it is the fact that Square Enix made two versions for the iPhone and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-ends-you-solo-remix/id545042359?mt=8">iPad</a>, with the latter being $19.99 rather than $17.99. It&rsquo;s a great port of the original DS game, though, and I believe it&rsquo;s worth every penny.</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-hexagon/id549027629?mt=8"><strong>Super Hexagon</strong></a>: A simple, twitchy game that tests your reflexes. Control a triangle in the center hexagon and move it so that it doesn&rsquo;t hit an encroaching wall. The action is fast-paced in this game and it will definitely take some practice before you get the hang of things. Test your skills in three difficulty levels, and unlock three more if you can survive through the entire test!</p>

		<document id="dd91a7bb6b5eda4af1484020b0334abc" url="http://christinechan.org/living-with-the-fitbit-flex-one-month-in"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/author/christinechan" title="About Christine Chan">my job</a> being a work-at-home kind of thing, it&#8217;s definitely hard to be active throughout the day. I&#8217;m always on the computer or on my mobile devices, doing what I have to do. And when I&#8217;m done with that, I end up being just a bit tired, and just wanting to kick back. However, I&#8217;ve come to realize that this is one of the reasons why I never seemed to lose any weight, as well as my poor dieting habits. </p>

<p>Just a month ago, I finally managed to find the Fitbit Flex in stock at my local Best Buy (it was the last one!), and decided to pick it up. I wanted to work on a more formal review of the product, but then Fitbit decided to drop the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/force" title="Fitbit® Force™">Force</a> on everyone, which is basically what the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/flex" title="Fitbit® Flex™">Flex</a> <em>should have been to begin with</em>. Rather than be angry about it (granted, I was for a bit when I saw that the Force was already available to order), I decided to tell you all about my personal experience with the Fitbit Flex during the month I&#8217;ve had it (since September 5, 2013), and how it has actually affected me. </p>

<h2 id="theflexwristbandandtracker">The Flex Wristband and Tracker</h2>

<p><img src="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa439/christyxcore/IMG_0643.jpg?t=1381626224" alt="The Fitbit Flex wristband"></p>

<p>For those who are unaware, the Flex is a rubberized wrist band that will house a Fitbit tracker and it will remain secure through the use of a small clasp that you push through the snug holes that are on the large or small (each Flex comes with two sizes of wristbands) band. </p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve gone several years without anything on my wrist (I used to be a heavy watch wearer years ago), I have been open to the concept of wearing a wristband yet again. I&#8217;ve actually owned the original Jawbone UP when it was first introduced, and then a Nike FuelBand. In the end, though, these products simply did not cut it for me and I eventually stopped using them (the FuelBand broke on me as well, and I just never got it fixed). </p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with the wristbands themselves, as I rather liked the UP&#8217;s design (it was simple) and the FuelBand (the secure snapping clasp), but the apps and the lack of things that it tracked that pushed me away. For example, I didn&#8217;t really like how the UP would &#8220;track&#8221; food with emotions, and the FuelBand basically was a fancy watch pedometer that didn&#8217;t track food or sleep. </p>

<p>The Flex, while it is not perfect in design itself, has become something I&#8217;ve grown attached to having on my wrist. It is a little thicker on the part where it holds the tracker, but that&#8217;s to be expected. The rubber material that the band is made out of does not irritate my skin, even if it is on fairly snugly. The only thing I didn&#8217;t really like was the fact that the clasp can sometimes be hard to secure, especially when you first get the Flex. I often found myself trying to push the clasp into the holes, but it requires accuracy and precision. It does get a bit easier over time, though, as I&#8217;ve noticed that it seems to have &#8220;loosened&#8221; up a bit. </p>

<p>I was a bit surprised to see that the Flex was basically a rubber band that had a space to fit a tracker in it, as I originally thought that it was a singular piece, like the UP or FuelBand. Since the tracker is something you will need to take out every now and then to charge up, this means that water or liquids can get in band itself, and even though the product claims to be water-resistant, I never took a chance with it by wearing it in the shower. </p>

<p>The tracker itself is a little piece that features small LED lights on a strip. You can view your progress throughout the day by tapping on the display a few times, at which it will show you how close you are to your goal. Blinking lights indicate that&#8217;s your current progress, but if you&#8217;re done, all of the lights will be solid. </p>

<p>In order to initiate the Flex&#8217;s sleep tracking, you will need to rapidly tap on the display for 1&#8211;2 seconds, at which point two dots will appear on both ends of the display to indicate Sleep Mode. To wake up your Flex, repeat the process. I found this to be a bit annoying in the beginning, as it took me quite a lot of tries to put to Sleep. However, I found that it switches over best when you have the Flex on securely and snugly, so that it doesn&#8217;t wiggle around. </p>

<p>The silent alarms are an amazing feature that actually do help you wake up. You can program multiple alarms for your Flex, and when the time comes, they will vibrate on your wrist. This is a much gentler way of waking up every morning without dealing with a blaring alarm clock. This feature originated with the UP, and I&#8217;m surprised I managed to go without it during my time with the FuelBand. It&#8217;s really one of my favorite ways of getting up every day, and it works. </p>

<p>Overall, the design of the Flex can be a bit annoying at first, but once you get used to it, the Flex just becomes a part of you. You&#8217;ll feel naked without it, and I always make sure that I have it on me. </p>

<h2 id="theflexasaconstantmotivationalsource">The Flex as a Constant Motivational Source</h2>

<p><img src="http://i1197.photobucket.com/albums/aa439/christyxcore/IMG_0644.jpg?t=1381626232" alt="Always reminding me..."></p>

<p>Even though plenty of people were saying that Fitbit was Sherlocked by Apple because of the <a href="http://christinechan.org/my-impressions-on-the-iphone-5s" title="My impressions on the iPhone 5s">iPhone 5s</a> M7 chip, I don&#8217;t agree with it. My iPhone is a constant source of entertainment, and it won&#8217;t be there, &#8220;nagging&#8221; me to go out and be active. Yes, it can track your movement without being a battery drain now, but it&#8217;s just not the same. With the Flex, it&#8217;s always on my wrist, and because of this, it&#8217;s always reminding me (a voluntary reminder) that I can always be more active. </p>

<p>Whenever I am wearing one of these fitness trackers on my wrist, I have a tendency to keep tapping on it to check my progress throughout the day. And not only that, but every time I eat or drink something now, I count the calories with MyFitnessPal, which syncs back to the Fitbit app. This means that throughout the day, as I&#8217;m inputting my calories and consumed water, I&#8217;m also opening the Fitbit app quite often, and I will always be seeing how many steps I&#8217;ve taken today, how long I&#8217;ve been active, and how many calories I&#8217;ve burned by breathing and moving around. </p>

<p>If I do not meet my step and calorie goals for the day, I end up feeling guilty just by taking a look at my wrist. A few taps and the indicator will remain near the bottom, telling me that I have not moved around much today. I&#8217;ve felt that since I&#8217;ve had the Flex, my desire to take walks and not just sit in my chair has risen significantly, and now I just get annoyed whenever I do not have a chance to put my feet to use. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s just always there, always a constant reminder, that I have set out to improve my own life, and this thing is the catalyst that started it. My iPhone is always in front of me as well, but I honestly don&#8217;t see it as a device that actively encourages me to go out and move around. The single purpose Flex is there, always giving me the push I need (just like my iPad with Editorial). </p>

<h2 id="shortlivedbutwellworthit">Short Lived But Well Worth It</h2>

<p>Again, I&#8217;m fairly annoyed that the Force just came out five months after the Flex. However, I am glad that I got my Flex, as it has pushed me towards a more healthy lifestyle. It may have been a pricey little motivator (as it cost me $100+), but my health is always a good investment, right? </p>

<p>The design of the Flex itself is not the best, but it&#8217;s definitely bearable, and just becomes a part of you once you get used to it. But the constant motivation that you get just from seeing the Flex in front of you made this well worth a buy to me. Not only do I get to see how active I am throughout the day, but I can easily keep track of calories, water, sleep, and how long I move around. All of these factors come into play as I make adjustments to my lifestyle in order to improve it in the long haul. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be ordering the Fitbit Force fairly soon, so stay tuned to see what I think of it. </p>

		<document id="60762f74a42a1c9f0eeddb5dcb50728" url="http://christinechan.org/my-impressions-on-the-iphone-5s"><![CDATA[<p>On September 25, 2013, I was giddy with joy as I found out that my Silver 64GB iPhone 5s unlocked for T-Mobile had arrived at my house. I rushed home to get it, and then took it to the T-Mobile store to get my number ported over from Sprint to T-Mobile, and now that I&#8217;ve had the phone for a while, I decided to share my thoughts with the rest of you. </p>

<h2 id="theportfromsprinttot-mobile">The Port from Sprint to T-Mobile</h2>

<p>The first thing I want to mention is how much happier I am off of Sprint&#8217;s crap-tacular network. Two years of the slowest speeds ever imaginable, though their still-expanding LTE network was good when you had it, the coverage was still very spotty as of the end of September 2013. The employee at the T-Mobile store ported my number over and it has been smooth sailing for me since. </p>

<p>While T-Mobile may not be considered in one of the top wireless providers, so far the coverage has proven to be excellent for me in my home and work area. Coming from Sprint, it&#8217;s a huge improvement, and I&#8217;m having no real issues with streaming content while I&#8217;m in my car or on my Metro commute to the office. </p>

<p>The rates are reasonable (I&#8217;m on the $70/mo Simple Choice with unlimited data) and the coverage is great so far. I don&#8217;t expect to get coverage everywhere in the country, but I&#8217;m not much of a traveler yet and I can easily just grab an AT&amp;T SIM if necessary (the T-Mobile unlocked iPhones work with other GSM carriers, as far as I know). </p>

<h2 id="theiphone5s">The iPhone 5s</h2>

<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>

<p>I picked up the Silver color, even though I did debate about the Gold version when rumors began circulating. However, I ended up not really liking how the gold ring looked with the white front, so I decided to go with Silver. </p>

<p>When I unboxed it, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice how good the silver model looks. And with all of the whitespace in iOS 7, I only feel that this is the natural color choice to go with. </p>

<p>As I picked it up, I noticed something right away: the iPhone 5s didn&#8217;t feel as light to me as the iPhone 5 did. From what I understand, the 5s seems to be a bit thicker than the 5 (or at least the white paint, maybe?), so I was rather surprised by the heft of it. It is still a fairly light device, but I wasn&#8217;t as <a href="http://christinechan.org/some-of-my-thoughts-on-the-iphone-5" title="Some of My Thoughts on the iPhone 5">amazed as I was with the original 5</a>. Still, the iPhone 5s itself is solid, and has the look and feel of a luxury device. </p>

<h3 id="touchid">Touch ID</h3>

<p>The fingerprint scanner (a.k.a. Touch ID) was something that I didn&#8217;t think much about when the phone was announced, but it has quickly became one of my most favorite things about my iPhone 5s. In fact, it is hard for me to go back to previous generations of the iPhone and iPad, where you still have to &#8220;slide to unlock&#8221; the device. As other techies have stated, we end up thinking that our old iDevice is broken because we place our finger (or whatever body part you chose to use for Touch ID) on the home button, and nothing happens. </p>

<p>It feels natural once you get used to it — of course, it&#8217;s always Apple that seems to make things actually work, and not be just another gimmick, as <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/motorola-atrix-had-a-fingerprint-scanner-two-years-before-iphone-5s/421125-11.html" title="Motorola Atrix had a fingerprint scanner two years before iPhone 5s">they weren&#8217;t the first to do a fingerprint scanner</a>, but the first to do it right. </p>

<p>The iPhone 5s supports up to 5 fingerprint profiles, and the process was relatively simple. All you need to do is gently rest your finger on the home button and lift it repeatedly for Touch ID to capture your print. Then it will ask you to move your finger around the edges for the full capture, and it&#8217;s rather neat to watch your print getting captured the entire time. </p>

<p>With five profiles available, it&#8217;s a smart idea to use four of them for your thumb and index finger on both hands. The fifth slot is nice for your significant other to take in case they need to use your phone (this is what I have done). This way, you are able to unlock your iPhone whether it is in your hand or on a flat surface. </p>

<p>Touch ID works flawlessly for unlocking the device — just place your finger on the home button for a second and lift it off, or wait for it to unlock. Either way, it&rsquo;s quite fast and works well. While the iTunes and App Store on iOS 7 is still a bit buggy for me, having the ability to use my fingerprint for purchases is rather awesome and convenient (when it works). </p>

<p>I wish that Touch ID had an API that developers could use for their apps, such as <a href="http://appadvice.com/review/quickadvice-1password4" title="Give Your Passwords Some Peace Of Mind With The New 1Password 4 -- AppAdvice">1Password</a>, or at least had other functions, such as returning to the home screen from an active app. Hopefully this can change in the future, but at the moment it is just limited to unlocking the device and making purchases in the App Store. </p>

<h3 id="thecamera">The Camera</h3>

<p>Even though the iPhone 5s still retains the 8MP camera, there have been other improvements made that make it a fantastic replacement for your everyday photos. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a pro photographer in any way, so I don&#8217;t know the finer details about the 5s camera specs, but I have noticed that the images I&#8217;ve taken are much more visible in the light, thanks to the larger sensor and aperture. And unlike other smartphone cameras, the colors in the photos have appeared natural, detailed, and clear. </p>

<p>The Continuous Burst Mode is one of my favorite things about the 5s and iOS 7. Just keep your finger down on the capture button, and the 5s will snap 10 photos per second. This is blazingly fast, and the analysis feature in the 5s (iPhone 5 has burst as well, but you don&#8217;t get the analysis) is incredibly handy to have. The analyzer will find the best photo of the shots taken, and showcase it. You can also go through the rest of the shots in that session and pick more Favorites. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a huge proponent of flash photography, but the 5s features a dual action LED flash that actually works. This dual flash consists of one white and one amber LED that work together to take photos that appear more natural, rather than washed out. It&#8217;s really nice to have a flash that doesn&#8217;t make your dark photos turn out crappy. </p>

<p>The Slow-Motion feature is pretty awesome, despite the fact that I&#8217;m not a huge video taker. I tested it out a bit, and it&#8217;s very fun and a great way to impress friends. The 5s will capture video at 120 fps, and during playback, you can select any section of the clip to play in quarter speed. This is a great feature, although it may not be new to the industry (along with burst mode), but it&#8217;s great to have it finally available on the iPhone. In addition, there is now live video zoom (finally!) and automatic image stabilization that really works, so your images are as crisp as ever. </p>

<h3 id="the64-bita7chip">The 64-bit A7 Chip</h3>

<p>Even though the iPhone 5 was pretty fast with iOS 7 already, I have been blown away at the speed of the iPhone 5s. I&#8217;ve pretty much experienced no lag whatsoever while I have multiple apps running, and everything is incredibly fast and just as responsive. </p>

<p>From a consumer standpoint, the 64-bit processor may not seem like much (what Average Joe person will understand what this really means?), and so far, there are not a lot of apps out there that make use of it. However, it really does shine with iPhone 5s optimized apps and games, such as <a href="http://appadvice.com/review/show-off-your-new-iphone-5s-with-infinity-blade-iii" title="Show Off Your New iPhone 5s With Infinity Blade III -- AppAdvice">Infinity Blade III</a>. I hope that the App Store begins filling up with more apps and games that are perfected to take advantage of the latest that Apple has to offer. After all, this is <em><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57602274-37/iphone-5s-a7-chip-is-first-64-bit-processor-for-smartphones/" title="iPhone 5S&#39; A7 chip is first 64-bit processor for smartphones | Apple - CNET News">the first 64-bit smartphone</a></em> that is available to the masses. </p>

<p>To sum up this section: 64-bit mobile phones are the future, Apple did it first, and it&#8217;s pretty sweet (once you have apps that utilize it). </p>

<h3 id="m7">M7</h3>

<p>The M7 is the separate chip that Apple made and included in the iPhone 5s to keep track of your motion activity with your iPhone, essentially turning it into a very accurate pedometer. Personally, I&#8217;ve still been using my <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" title="Fitbit® Official Site: Flex, One &amp; Zip Wireless Activity &amp; Sleep Trackers">Fitbit Flex</a> for my activity and health tracking (combined with <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/" title="Free Calorie Counter, Diet &amp; Exercise Journal | MyFitnessPal.com">MyFitnessPal</a> for calorie counting), but the M7 is incredibly convenient for those who do not want to invest $100 or so into wearable tech (the <a href="https://jawbone.com/up" title="UP by Jawbone | Activity Tracker | Band + App for a Healthier You">Jawbone UP</a>, <a href="http://www.nike.com/cdp/fuelband/us/en_us/" title="Nike+ Fuelband. Track your Activity and Earn NikeFuel. Nike.com">Nike FuelBand</a>, and <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/" title="Fitbit® Official Site: Flex, One &amp; Zip Wireless Activity &amp; Sleep Trackers">Fitbit trackers</a>). </p>

<p>Once you get your iPhone 5s, the M7 will automatically begin tracking the amount of steps that you take (given the fact that you are carrying your iPhone 5s, of course). When you find apps that take advantage of the data that is stored on the M7, such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/argus-motion-fitness-tracker/id624329444?mt=8">Argus</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8">Pedometer++</a>, they will pull all of the data from even before you installed the apps, which is very convenient. This will give you an idea of how active you are, without worrying about actively tracking anything. </p>

<p>Previously, with the iPhone 5, apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moves/id509204969?mt=8">Moves</a> and Argus would take a significant toll on the battery, since this information was being stored on the A6 chip. Now that the M7 is separate from the core A7 chip, the strain is taken off of the main processor, there is no need for the app to be left active in the background, and battery life is much improved. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been meaning to take a second look at your own motion activity, but didn&#8217;t want to invest in a separate fitness tracker, then the iPhone 5s M7 is definitely worth getting, for sake of convenience and a more active lifestyle. </p>

<h3 id="battery">Battery</h3>

<p>The most impressive thing about the iPhone 5s, at least in my opinion, is the battery life. Pretty much every day that I&#8217;ve been using the phone, I can last a good chunk of my day without being plugged in. With my iPhone 5, it would begin reaching about 50 percent by lunch time after I put it through the ringer for app reviews (I believe that it actually had a hardware problem, but I never took it in before I sold it for cash). </p>

<p>However, with my iPhone 5s, even by the time I was done testing out apps, including some pretty graphically intense games, it would be at about 70 percent or around that point. I also stream content fairly often now that I have better data speeds, check social networks and email throughout the day, use navigation, play some other games, and it will still last a fairly long time. </p>

<p>Of course, another thing that helps with battery life is having only what I need on all the time. This includes turning Background App Refresh off, most notifications, and closing a lot of apps in the background that I do not necessarily need running. </p>

<h2 id="isitworthgetting">Is It Worth Getting?</h2>

<p>The biggest reason I got the 5s was to get off of Sprint and on to T-Mobile. I had the iPhone 5 previously, but I actually do believe if you are able to get the 5s, you definitely should. The battery is tons better than the 5, and I am absolutely in love with Touch ID, as well as the improved camera. While the M7 is a very neat addition, it isn&#8217;t affecting me as much as others, as I still prefer my Fitbit. </p>

<p>In short: if you can get an upgrade, or afford it for an unsubsidized price, then I highly recommend getting it when you can. </p>

<p>However, if you aren&#8217;t a person who needs to have the latest-and-greatest, but didn&#8217;t have an iPhone 5, then the iPhone 5c (rather than the 5s) would be a good choice as well. I don&#8217;t own one personally, but it&#8217;s basically the iPhone 5 with a slightly improved battery and quite a solid build. </p>

<p>Seriously, I played around a bit with one in the Apple Store, and even though it&#8217;s plastic, it&#8217;s definitely not <em>cheap feeling</em> plastic, as you would expect from a plastic phone. Instead, it feels like a ceramic material, incredibly solid and has a good feel in the hand. </p>

<p>The iPhone 5s is for the techies or those who want the most powerful offering to suit their needs, and the 5c is for your everyday, average person. Either way, both of these new phones are worth upgrading to if you have the chance.</p>

<p>As much as I love my iPhone, I also can&rsquo;t leave my wallet behind. But it&rsquo;s just so much of a hassle to keep my wallet separately, because it&rsquo;s just another thing to worry about. I would love to just remember my bag, keys, and iPhone, without having to think, &ldquo;Did I get my money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is the CM4 Q Card Case for iPhone 4/4S.</p>

<p>This is a hybrid rubber and premium cloth case that provides fantastic protection to your beloved iPhone. It&rsquo;s easy to get it on your device too — just push it in to the rubber and make sure that it fits snugly around it. Once it&rsquo;s on, it just feels right.</p>

<p>The rubbery sides will provide added grip to your iPhone, and the &ldquo;Natural Throw&rdquo; buttons helps to provide an organic connection with your volume and power buttons. All of your ports and switches are easily accessible as well, since the case has perfectly sized cutouts for them. The case even provides a rubber lip around the front side of your iPhone so that the front glass will be protected if dropped face-down. The Q features a soft-touch finish so that it is easy to pull the iPhone out of your pocket.</p>

<p>The real magic, though, is the fact that this case provides a premium fabric pocket on the back for you to keep about three cards and some cash. While they recommend only up to three cards, it is actually possible to get about four cards in there, though it will end up being a very tight fit. However, there is a small thumb slot on the side of the pocket, which you can use to push your cards out.</p>

<p>If you use the pocket for more than three cards, then you may end up with a bit of stretching out of the pocket over time. However, it should still be secure enough to hold less than four if this happens.</p>

<p>The only negative thing about the Q Card Case is the fact that all of the colors besides black will be hard to clean if it gets dirty. That&rsquo;s the only negative, so if that worries you, then you will want to snag up the black color. However, my personal favorite is the Pacific Green.</p>

<p>If you want a case that makes you not need to carry one more thing, then I highly recommend checking out the Q Card Case from CM4. It has become one of my favorite all-in-one wallet solutions for the iPhone 4S.</p>

		<document id="b459a8c18a9b8e36d9ef1c39567cf229" url="http://christinechan.org/some-of-my-thoughts-on-the-iphone-5"><![CDATA[<p>So I&rsquo;ve had my iPhone 5 for an entire weekend, and I figure it&rsquo;s time to jot down some thoughts. I decided on a black/slate 32GB model, currently on Sprint. While I am not able to enjoy LTE on my iPhone until Sprint rolls out their LTE network in the Los Angeles area (which they claim to launch in October/November), I still like the device.</p>

<p><strong>Profile</strong>: The first time I picked up my iPhone 5 from out of the box, I was amazed at how much lighter it is. In fact, for a second I thought, &ldquo;This feels like a fake iPhone!&rdquo; Yeah, it&rsquo;s just that light. Now when I pick up an iPhone 4 or 4S, it really does feel like a brick in comparison. It&rsquo;s amazing what Apple has done to the overall weight of the device. Even though I have wrapped my iPhone 5 in a case (and many more to come, reviews incoming), it is still <em>incredibly light</em>. It&rsquo;s just mind-blowing.</p>

<p>Despite it being incredibly light, it&rsquo;s still built very well. There are no &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; materials here, so it definitely doesn&rsquo;t feel like a plastic Android phone. The guys at Apple really know how to design and engineer their products, which isn&rsquo;t really found with other companies.</p>

<p><strong>Screen</strong>: Apple also made the device taller, with a 4&quot; screen. The width remains the same, which I&rsquo;m pretty grateful for — otherwise, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use this with one hand at all. At first, I felt a bit weird with the fact that I can no longer just reach my thumb over the screen to reach the back buttons in apps, and corners. However, given the light weight of it, I can quickly move the phone enough to reach the other corner as needed. The taller screen does not bother me as much as it did at first, and that&rsquo;s mainly because Apple decided to not go wider. It just makes sense — not everyone has giant&rsquo;s hands, alright?</p>

<p>I have gotten used to the tall screen rather quickly. I appreciate being able to see more tweets in Tweetbot, more emails, more of the conversation in Messages, and more of everything, really. I don&rsquo;t really like non-iPhone 5 optimized apps, which end up being &ldquo;letterboxed,&rdquo; but here&rsquo;s a bonus of having more space at the top: banner notifications will not interfere with your current app! An unforeseen advantage, I suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Battery</strong>: The iPhone 5 is also a lot thinner than its predecessor. Well, maybe not <em>that</em> much, but it is definitely noticeable. It is enough to make a difference when you hold it, at least. The most amazing part is that while the device is thinner, the battery life remains just as good as the 4S — even better, actually. My 4S used to drain rather quickly, though perhaps that was due to the iOS 6 GM that was on it. But with my iPhone 5, it has been lasting me an entire day of being out and about without another charge.</p>

<p><strong>A6</strong>: Thanks to the A6 chip, everything is faster and snappier than the 4S. Taking photos is awesome — tap the capture button as fast as you can, and the iPhone 5 will keep up with you. Everything feels more responsive, and games load up quicker. Definitely a big improvement here.</p>

<p><strong>Five rows of apps</strong>: I had perfected my 4S home screen, but having an extra row available really changes things. I am now able to have four more incredibly useful apps on my home screen, which means less taps to access them. I&rsquo;m a bit of a home screen junkie, so I definitely appreciate having the extra space.</p>

<p><strong>iSight Camera</strong>: I have not taken a lot of photos as of late, but photos taken with an iPhone 5 definitely look clearer and more natural than those taken with the 4S, even though they are both an 8 megapixel lens. The improved optics in the 5 really make a difference, and it&rsquo;s quite noticeable, especially if you compare them side-by-side.</p>

<p>Low light images will have the biggest difference. The iPhone 5 takes less grainy photos, and it&rsquo;s much more clear. Video seems pretty good, and I love the fact that you are now able to take photos while recording video. I know that Apple is not the first to do this, but I like how it&rsquo;s implemented.</p>

<p>And now the front-facing camera is great! I love not having mugshots that look like they were taken with a feature phone.</p>

<p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: I like it on the bottom. Why? Now, if you have headphones plugged in and are snapping photos, the cord will not interfere with your images. I also slide my phone into my pocket with the screen facing inward, and the top of the phone goes in first. Now I won&rsquo;t have to fumble around with the cord since it will be near the pocket opening, and my phone will be ready to use in my hand the moment it comes out. It&rsquo;s just <em>natural</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Lightning</strong>: I was definitely surprised at how small this new plug actually is. The photos on the website before it was released made it appear out of proportion — once you see it in person, it is <strong><em>tiny</em></strong>. In fact, I would say that it is no bigger than my pinky finger, and I have pretty small hands. An evolution like this was only natural, and I love the fact that the Lightning cable is now androgynous, so that it can be plugged in both ways. No more fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out which way is the proper way to plug in your iPhone!</p>

<p>The only thing I wish that the Lightning cable did was sync/charge faster — I mean, why name it &ldquo;Lightning&rdquo; if the speed is the same as before?</p>

<p>I have already picked up two extra cables for my laptop bag and car, so now I&rsquo;ll never have to worry about forgetting a cable again. Too bad I will have to carry a separate one now for my iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Black vs White</strong>: So I&rsquo;ve seen both in person now. The black is still sexy, and feels like the iPhone that Batman would use. My favorite part is that it is completely black — there&rsquo;s no chrome whatsoever. However, I am a bit disappointed that the black one is prone to scratching and nicks rather easily, and the aluminum backing does attract fingerprints and oil smudges. I preferred to not use a case with my black iPhone 5, but I don&rsquo;t think that is possible. I am hoping that my iPhone 5 won&rsquo;t see too many dings over time, but I got AppleCare (for the first time ever) just in case.</p>

<p>The white is definitely like a jewel, especially with the chamfered and shining bezel. Some part of me wishes I had gotten white instead, since it doesn&rsquo;t have the scratching and nicking problem that the black one has, but I still absolutely love the style of the black one this time around. But you still should see them both in person — I wish I could have both, but I&rsquo;m not made of money.</p>

<p>Letterboxed apps will definitely look better on the black model though, since it blends in with the edges of the glass. You also don&rsquo;t have to see the extra stuff around the earpiece, which sticks out like a sore thumb on the white model.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong>: Even though I had a 4S, I&rsquo;m very glad I upgraded, and I personally think it is worth it if you have the money for it. It&rsquo;s actually a bigger change from the 4S than most think, because the extra room on the screen does make a huge difference. And it does so without making the device ridiculous to actually use with one hand, as phones should be used (not a 5&quot; mini tablet).</p>

<p>It seems Apple is doing fine without Steve Jobs for now, though this may be the last thing that Steve touched before he passed away. I will look forward to the next iPhone while enjoying the heck out of this one.</p>

<p>?????</p>

You can see his post <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I loved Twitter since I joined back in 2007. That was when it was a tight community of early adopters and other geeks and nerds. The kind of people I like to talk to.</p>

<p>Then, Ashton Kutcher came in to the picture and started using Twitter. Then celebrities joined, thus pulling in the &ldquo;average&rdquo; person to what was once a geeky haven.</p>

<p>Now Twitter is all over the place and they want to focus more on their official apps, which really suck, by the way. I mean, Twitter for Mac hasn&rsquo;t even been updated since June 2011, and there have been <strong>two major OS X releases since then, and even a Retina MacBook Pro.</strong> Really, it&rsquo;s clear where their priorities are.</p>

<p>Third party apps were what started Twitter and got it to where it is now. And today, Twitter showed us that they no longer want these. They will be restricting the amount of users that an app can have (up to 100,000 users, and can&rsquo;t grow past 200% of that without &ldquo;permission&rdquo; from Twitter) and reducing API calls to 60 for each separate action, rather than the 350 total that it is now. </p>

<p>The focus is no longer developers and users, but just getting people to use their shitty apps and web view.</p>

<p><strong>Today <a href="https://alpha.app.net/christinechan">I joined App.net</a>, and it&rsquo;s bittersweet.</strong></p>
