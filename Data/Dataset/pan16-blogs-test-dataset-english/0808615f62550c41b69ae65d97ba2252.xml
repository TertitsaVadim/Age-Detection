It&#8217;s all downhill from here, folks&#8230; or is it? After seeing 300 of 366, I realized how close I am to the end of this photo journey. 300 unique photos, each with their own little story behind them, and only 66 stories to go before I complete [...]

I&#8217;m proud to say my team has won each time and has done so consecutively for the past 11 years! Each game is always exciting and we always have a great time [...]

But I am lucky that I was able to use their car because it could [...]

Life goes on and we all will [...]

It will be hard to top 2012 as I think it was one of my better years, but I can at least make an attempt to maintain everything I built up in the past year. I decided to start it off right by reformatting my computer. I had some issues with [...]

I saw The Hobbit with Kristin, which was pretty good, but kind of long at certain parts. It was nice to enjoy a beer with the movie at the dine-in theater, which in itself, is a great idea. I also decided to [...]

Not too exciting, and a little rough around the edges. I started off by doing some experimenting with long exposures in my car. It was a simple setup. I strapped my camera mounted to my tripod in the back seat of my car, then I used my remote [...]

It&#8217;s too cold, too dark, too damp, and too long. I guess being in the dead of winter doesn&#8217;t help it much either&#8230; I found myself not really doing anything too interesting this week, but I still got my photos as usual. I noticed this week was mostly filled with [...]

Nearly a whole year has gone by in what seems like the blink of an eye, and I&#8217;m still not out of ideas nor do I feel like I really shot it all. So much has happened in these past 51 weeks, [...]

One full year of my life has been more or less documented every single day, starting on my 10,000th day of life on February 9, 2012. From there, I just kept doing what I do best: taking pictures. This project in particular has been very [...]
