This really does seem to be an example of Microsoft trying an  innovative application of technology and, while the image pattern  recognition algorithms behind this service are certainly not new. Essentially, given the latitude and longitude coordinates of a  bounding box, and two points that lie somewhere on a road in that area,  the service attempts to use Bing Maps’ aerial imagery dataset to  automatically identify the set of points following the route of that  road (and, optionally, other roads that connect to it).&nbsp; With a combination of automatic,  approximate feature identification, and manual correction and  correlation against Bing Maps aerial imagery, we could very quickly see a  large amount of routing data being made available in countries that at  the moment have no road network information.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-g4OcBHKOIus/TWz6vv3JPPI/AAAAAAAAFXA/Jto4m-2avjo/s1600/bing_destination_map.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-g4OcBHKOIus/TWz6vv3JPPI/AAAAAAAAFXA/Jto4m-2avjo/s400/bing_destination_map.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Check this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR0WV2dGIRc" style="color: red;">video</a><br />Further info:&nbsp; <a href="http://magicshop.cloudapp.net/" title="http://magicshop.cloudapp.net/">http://magicshop.cloudapp.net/</a> , <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/automatic-road-detection-the-good-and-the-bad/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+highearthorbit%2FGSef+%28High+Earth+Orbit%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">bingmaps</a><br /><br />Happy to hear about ur views !! :)&nbsp; </div>

Just sharing few info abt it..!! :)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; German scientists have developed a car that can be used without the  need driven. driver's brain would determine the direction and the  vehicle was moving as desired. The driver was wearing a special  headset - originally designed for video games - which have sensors and  connected to the vehicle electronic devices wirelessly. Brain driver  only needs to "think" like "turn left", "turn right" and added speed.  Equipment  named BrainDriver worked with to get input from a variety of video  cameras in vehicles, radars and sensors. The supply of such data can  provide 3-dimensional views of the surrounding cars. Special headset  consists of 16 sensors that charge capture the brain electromagnetic  signals. Computer  translated the signal. In the pilot, the driver can steer left or right  turning vehicles although there is little lag between the time you give  the command to move the vehicle. In the 2nd test, the vehicle was  "trained" to recognize the turn left, turn right, plus the gas and brake  pressure. The  project was conducted by a team AutoNOMOS, one unit of the Artificial  Intelligence Group, which owned Freie Universität in Berlin.The  researchers suggested their work a new concept and "still far from the  engine control technology with the brain. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/iDV_62QoHjY/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iDV_62QoHjY&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iDV_62QoHjY&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br /></div>

Super full moon will be rising near the horizons.<br /><br />A perigee full Moon brings with it extra-high "perigean tides," but this  is nothing to worry about, according to NOAA. In most places, lunar  gravity at perigee pulls tide waters only a few centimeters (an inch or  so) higher than usual. Local geography can amplify the effect to about  15 centimeters (six inches)--not exactly a great flood.     </div>

This is when Saturn and the sun are on opposite sides of the sky, as seen from Earth.   At opposition the planet rises at sunset and sets at sunrise. It's also  physically closest to the Earth in its orbit, so it appears larger and  brighter. In fact, this month it's the only bright planet you'll see at  night. For the last two years, most people have been disappointed because  Saturn's famous rings have been "edge on" to Earth. Saturn’s rings are  tilted towards a particular point in the sky so that as Saturn travels  in its orbit around the sun, sometimes the rings are presented towards  us and at other times they disappear when the Earth is in the same plane  as the rings. The Cassini spacecraft has been studying the Saturn system for almost  seven years, sending back data and amazing images of the rings, icy  moons, Saturn's magnetosphere, Titan and Saturn itself. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://0.gvt0.com/vi/pBUkTMk-Icw/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/pBUkTMk-Icw&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/pBUkTMk-Icw&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />&nbsp;Source: http://solarsystem.jpl.nasa.gov/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.space.com/11262-saturn-skywatching-tips-evening-sky.html <br /><br /></div>

Of the hundreds of clusters, the largest are the  capital cities of Islamabad, Pakistan, and New Delhi, India. (For scale,  these metropolitan areas are approximately 700 kilometers or 435 miles  apart.) The lines of major highways connecting the cities also stand  out. More subtle, but still visible at night, are the general outlines  of the towering and partly cloud-covered Himalayas to the north (image  left). <br />A striking feature is the line of lights, with a distinctly orange  hue, snaking across the center of the image. It appears to be more  continuous and brighter than most highways in the view. This is the  fenced and floodlit border zone between India and Pakistan. The fence is  designed to discourage smuggling and arms trafficking. A similar fenced  zone separates India’s eastern border from Bangladesh (not visible).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PpR927K1kfA/Tmhxqn1YW7I/AAAAAAAAFes/2V8ns7hU8rI/s1600/ISS028-E-029679_lrg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PpR927K1kfA/Tmhxqn1YW7I/AAAAAAAAFes/2V8ns7hU8rI/s400/ISS028-E-029679_lrg.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;Source:<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov</a><br /><br />This image was taken with a 16 mm lens, which provides the wide field  of view, as the International Space Station (ISS) was tracking towards  the southeast across India. The ISS crew took the image as part of a  continuous series of frames, each with a one-second exposure time to  maximize light collection. Unfortunately, this also causes blurring of  some ground features. <br />The distinct, bright zone above the horizon (visible at image top) is  airglow, a phenomena caused by excitation of atoms and molecules high  in the atmosphere (above 80 kilometers, or 50 miles altitude) by  ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Part of the ISS Permanent  Multipurpose Module and a solar panel array are visible at image right. </div>
